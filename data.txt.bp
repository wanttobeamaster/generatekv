　　THE RIFT

　　As he dropped the last grisly fragment of the dismembered and mutilated body into the small vat of nitric acid that was to devour every trace of the horrid evidence which might easily send him to the gallows, the man sank weakly into a chair and throwing his body forward upon his great, teak desk buried his face in his arms, breaking into dry, moaning sobs.

　　Beads of perspiration followed the seams of his high, wrinkled forehead, replacing the tears which might have lessened the pressure upon his overwrought nerves.  His slender frame shook, as with ague, and at times was racked by a convulsive shudder.  A sudden step upon the stairway leading to his workshop brought him trembling and wide eyed to his feet, staring fearfully at the locked and bolted door.

　　Although he knew perfectly well whose the advancing footfalls were, he was all but overcome by the madness of apprehension as they came softly nearer and nearer to the barred door.  At last they halted before it, to be followed by a gentle knock.

　　"Daddy!" came the sweet tones of a girl's voice.

　　The man made an effort to take a firm grasp upon himself that no tell-tale evidence of his emotion might be betrayed in his speech.

　　"Daddy!" called the girl again, a trace of anxiety in her voice this time.  "What IS the matter with you, and what ARE you doing?  You've been shut up in that hateful old room for three days now without a morsel to eat, and in all likelihood without a wink of sleep.  You'll kill yourself with your stuffy old experiments."

　　The man's face softened.

　　"Don't worry about me, sweetheart," he replied in a well controlled voice.  "I'll soon be through now--soon be through--and then we'll go away for a long vacation-- for a long vacation."

　　"I'll give you until noon, Daddy," said the girl in a voice which carried a more strongly defined tone of authority than her father's soft drawl, "and then I shall come into that room, if I have to use an axe, and bring you out--do you understand?"

　　Professor Maxon smiled wanly.  He knew that his daughter was equal to her threat.

　　"All right, sweetheart, I'll be through by noon for sure--by noon for sure.  Run along and play now, like a good little girl."

　　Virginia Maxon shrugged her shapely shoulders and shook her head hopelessly at the forbidding panels of the door.

　　"My dolls are all dressed for the day," she cried, "and I'm tired of making mud pies--I want you to come out and play with me."  But Professor Maxon did not reply-- he had returned to view his grim operations, and the hideousness of them had closed his ears to the sweet tones of the girl's voice.

　　As she turned to retrace her steps to the floor below Miss Maxon still shook her head.

　　"Poor old Daddy," she mused, "were I a thousand years old, wrinkled and toothless, he would still look upon me as his baby girl."

　　If you chance to be an alumnus of Cornell you may recall Professor Arthur Maxon, a quiet, slender, white-haired gentleman, who for several years was an assistant professor in one of the departments of natural science.  Wealthy by inheritance, he had chosen the field of education for his life work solely from a desire to be of some material benefit to mankind since the meager salary which accompanied his professorship was not of sufficient import to influence him in the slightest degree.

　　Always keenly interested in biology, his almost unlimited means had permitted him to undertake, in secret, a series of daring experiments which had carried him so far in advance of the biologists of his day that he had, while others were still groping blindly for the secret of life, actually reproduced by chemical means the great phenomenon.

　　Fully alive to the gravity and responsibilities of his marvellous discovery he had kept the results of his experimentation, and even the experiments themselves, a profound secret not only from his colleagues, but from his only daughter, who heretofore had shared his every hope and aspiration.

　　It was the very success of his last and most pretentious effort that had placed him in the horrifying predicament in which he now found himself-- with the corpse of what was apparently a human being in his workshop and no available explanation that could possibly be acceptable to a matter-of-fact and unscientific police.

　　Had he told them the truth they would have laughed at him.  Had he said: "This is not a human being that you see, but the remains of a chemically produced counterfeit created in my own laboratory," they would have smiled, and either hanged him or put him away with the other criminally insane.

　　This phase of the many possibilities which he had realized might be contingent upon even the partial success of his work alone had escaped his consideration, so that the first wave of triumphant exultation with which he had viewed the finished result of this last experiment had been succeeded by overwhelming consternation as he saw the thing which he had created gasp once or twice with the feeble spark of life with which he had endowed it, and expire--leaving upon his hands the corpse of what was, to all intent and purpose, a human being, albeit a most grotesque and misshapen thing.

　　Until nearly noon Professor Maxon was occupied in removing the remaining stains and evidences of his gruesome work, but when he at last turned the key in the door of his workshop it was to leave behind no single trace of the successful result of his years of labor.

　　The following afternoon found him and Virginia crossing the station platform to board the express for New York. So quietly had their plans been made that not a friend was at the train to bid them farewell--the scientist felt that he could not bear the strain of attempting explanations at this time.

　　But there were those there who recognized them, and one especially who noted the lithe, trim figure and beautiful face of Virginia Maxon though he did not know even the name of their possessor.  It was a tall well built young man who nudged one of his younger companions as the girl crossed the platform to enter her Pullman.

　　"I say, Dexter," he exclaimed, "who is that beauty?"

　　The one addressed turned in the direction indicated by his friend.

　　"By jove!" he exclaimed.  "Why it's Virginia Maxon and the professor, her father.  Now where do you suppose they're going?"

　　"I don't know--now," replied the first speaker, Townsend J. Harper, Jr., in a half whisper, "but I'll bet you a new car that I find out."

　　A week later, with failing health and shattered nerves, Professor Maxon sailed with his daughter for a long ocean voyage, which he hoped would aid him in rapid recuperation, and permit him to forget the nightmare memory of those three horrible days and nights in his workshop.

　　He believed that he had reached an unalterable decision never again to meddle with the mighty, awe inspiring secrets of creation; but with returning health and balance he found himself viewing his recent triumph with feelings of renewed hope and anticipation.

　　The morbid fears superinduced by the shock following the sudden demise of the first creature of his experiments had given place to a growing desire to further prosecute his labors until enduring success had crowned his efforts with an achievement which he might exhibit with pride to the scientific world.

　　His recent disastrous success had convinced him that neither Ithaca nor any other abode of civilization was a safe place to continue his experiments, but it was not until their cruising had brought them among the multitudinous islands of the East Indies that the plan occurred to him that he finally adopted--a plan the outcome of which could he then have foreseen would have sent him scurrying to the safety of his own country with the daughter who was to bear the full brunt of the horrors it entailed.

　　They were steaming up the China Sea when the idea first suggested itself, and as he sat idly during the long, hot days the thought grew upon him, expanding into a thousand wonderful possibilities, until it became crystalized into what was a little short of an obsession.

　　The result was that at Manila, much to Virginia's surprise, he announced the abandonment of the balance of their purposed voyage, taking immediate return passage to Singapore.  His daughter did not question him as to the cause of this change in plans, for since those three days that her father had kept himself locked in his workroom at home the girl had noticed a subtle change in her parent--a marked disinclination to share with her his every confidence as had been his custom since the death of her mother.

　　While it grieved her immeasurably she was both too proud and too hurt to sue for a reestablishment of the old relations.  On all other topics than his scientific work their interests were as mutual as formerly, but by what seemed a manner of tacit agreement this subject was taboo.  And so it was that they came to Singapore without the girl having the slightest conception of her father's plans.

　　Here they spent nearly a month, during which time Professor Maxon was daily engaged in interviewing officials, English residents and a motley horde of Malays and Chinamen.

　　Virginia met socially several of the men with whom her father was engaged but it was only at the last moment that one of them let drop a hint of the purpose of the month's activity.  When Virginia was present the conversation seemed always deftly guided from the subject of her father's immediate future, and she was not long in discerning that it was in no sense through accident that this was true.  Thereafter her wounded pride made easy the task of those who seemed combined to keep her in ignorance.

　　It was a Dr. von Horn, who had been oftenest with her father, who gave her the first intimation of what was forthcoming.  Afterward, in recollecting the conversation, it seemed to Virginia that the young man had been directed to break the news to her, that her father might be spared the ordeal.  It was evident then that he expected opposition, but the girl was too loyal to let von Horn know if she felt other than in harmony with the proposal, and too proud to evince by surprise the fact that she was not wholly conversant with its every detail.

　　"You are glad to be leaving Singapore so soon?" he had asked, although he knew that she had not been advised that an early departure was planned.

　　"I am rather looking forward to it," replied Virginia.

　　"And to a protracted residence on one of the Pamarung Islands?" continued von Horn.

　　"Why not?" was her rather non-committal reply, though she had not the remotest idea of their location.

　　Von Horn admired her nerve though he rather wished that she would ask some questions--it was difficult making progress in this way.  How could he explain the plans when she evinced not the slightest sign that she was not already entirely conversant with them?

　　"We doubt if the work will be completed under two or three years," answered the doctor.  "That will be a long time in which to be isolated upon a savage little speck of land off the larger but no less savage Borneo. Do you think that your bravery is equal to the demands that will be made upon it?"

　　Virginia laughed, nor was there the slightest tremor in its note.

　　"I am equal to whatever fate my father is equal to," she said, "nor do I think that a life upon one of these beautiful little islands would be much of a hardship-- certainly not if it will help to promote the success of his scientific experiments."

　　She used the last words on a chance that she might have hit upon the true reason for the contemplated isolation from civilization.  They had served their purpose too in deceiving von Horn who was now half convinced that Professor Maxon must have divulged more of their plans to his daughter than he had led the medical man to believe.  Perceiving her advantage from the expression on the young man's face, Virginia followed it up in an endeavor to elicit the details.

　　The result of her effort was the knowledge that on the second day they were to sail for the Pamarung Islands upon a small schooner which her father had purchased, with a crew of Malays and lascars, and von Horn, who had served in the American navy, in command.  The precise point of destination was still undecided--the plan being to search out a suitable location upon one of the many little islets which dot the western shore of the Macassar Strait.

　　Of the many men Virginia had met during the month at Singapore von Horn had been by far the most interesting and companionable.  Such time as he could find from the many duties which had devolved upon him in the matter of obtaining and outfitting the schooner, and signing her two mates and crew of fifteen, had been spent with his employer's daughter.

　　The girl was rather glad that he was to be a member of their little company, for she had found him a much travelled man and an interesting talker with none of the, to her, disgusting artificialities of the professional ladies' man.  He talked to her as he might have talked to a man, of the things that interest intelligent people regardless of sex.

　　There was never any suggestion of familiarity in his manner; nor in his choice of topics did he ever ignore the fact that she was a young girl.  She had felt entirely at ease in his society from the first evening that she had met him, and their acquaintance had grown to a very sensible friendship by the time of the departure of the Ithaca--the rechristened schooner which was to carry them away to an unguessed fate.

　　The voyage from Singapore to the Islands was without incident.  Virginia took a keen delight in watching the Malays and lascars at their work, telling von Horn that she had to draw upon her imagination but little to picture herself a captive upon a pirate ship--the half naked men, the gaudy headdress, the earrings, and the fierce countenances of many of the crew furnishing only too realistically the necessary savage setting.

　　A week spent among the Pamarung Islands disclosed no suitable site for the professor's camp, nor was it until they had cruised up the coast several miles north of the equator and Cape Santang that they found a tiny island a few miles off the coast opposite the mouth of a small river--an island which fulfilled in every detail their requirements.

　　It was uninhabited, fertile and possessed a clear, sweet brook which had its source in a cold spring in the higher land at the island's center.  Here it was that the Ithaca came to anchor in a little harbor, while her crew under von Horn, and the Malay first mate, Bududreen, accompanied Professor Maxon in search of a suitable location for a permanent camp.

　　The cook, a harmless old Chinaman, and Virginia were left in sole possession of the Ithaca.

　　Two hours after the departure of the men into the jungle Virginia heard the fall of axes on timber and knew that the site of her future home had been chosen and the work of clearing begun.  She sat musing on the strange freak which had prompted her father to bury them in this savage corner of the globe; and as she pondered there came a wistful expression to her eyes, and an unwonted sadness drooped the corners of her mouth.

　　Of a sudden she realized how wide had become the gulf between them now.  So imperceptibly had it grown since those three horrid days in Ithaca just prior to their departure for what was to have been but a few months' cruise that she had not until now comprehended that the old relations of open, good-fellowship had gone, possibly forever.

　　Had she needed proof of the truth of her sad discovery it had been enough to point to the single fact that her father had brought her here to this little island without making the slightest attempt to explain the nature of his expedition.  She had gleaned enough from von Horn to understand that some important scientific experiments were to be undertaken; but what their nature she could not imagine, for she had not the slightest conception of the success that had crowned her father's last experiment at Ithaca, although she had for years known of his keen interest in the subject.

　　The girl became aware also of other subtle changes in her father.  He had long since ceased to be the jovial, carefree companion who had shared with her her every girlish joy and sorrow and in whom she had confided both the trivial and momentous secrets of her childhood.  He had become not exactly morose, but rather moody and absorbed, so that she had of late never found an opportunity for the cozy chats that had formerly meant so much to them both.  There had been too, recently, a strange lack of consideration for herself that had wounded her more than she had imagined.  Today there had been a glaring example of it in his having left her alone upon the boat without a single European companion--something that he would never have thought of doing a few months before.

　　As she sat speculating on the strange change which had come over her father her eyes had wandered aimlessly along the harbor's entrance; the low reef that protected it from the sea, and the point of land to the south, that projected far out into the strait like a gigantic index finger pointing toward the mainland, the foliage covered heights of which were just visible above the western horizon.

　　Presently her attention was arrested by a tossing speck far out upon the rolling bosom of the strait.  For some time the girl watched the object until at length it resolved itself into a boat moving head on toward the island.  Later she saw that it was long and low, propelled by a single sail and many oars, and that it carried quite a company.

　　Thinking it but a native trading boat, so many of which ply the southern seas, Virginia viewed its approach with but idle curiosity.  When it had come to within half a mile of the anchorage of the Ithaca, and was about to enter the mouth of the harbor Sing Lee's eyes chanced to fall upon it.  On the instant the old Chinaman was electrified into sudden and astounding action.

　　"Klick!  Klick!" he cried, running toward Virginia. "Go b'low, klick."

　　"Why should I go below, Sing?" queried the girl, amazed by the demeanor of the cook.

　　"Klick!  Klick!" he urged grasping her by the arm--half leading, half dragging her toward the companion-way. "Plilates!  Mlalay plilates--Dyak plilates."

　　"Pirates!" gasped Virginia.  "Oh Sing, what can we do?"

　　"You go b'low.  Mebbyso Sing flighten 'em.  Shoot cannon.  Bling help.  Maxon come klick.  Bling men. Chase'm 'way," explained the Chinaman.  "But plilates see 'em pletty white girl," he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head dubiously, "then old Sing no can flighten 'em 'way."

　　The girl shuddered, and crouching close behind Sing hurried below.  A moment later she heard the boom of the old brass six pounder which for many years had graced the Ithaca's stern.  In the bow Professor Maxon had mounted a modern machine gun, but this was quite beyond Sing's simple gunnery.  The Chinaman had not taken the time to sight the ancient weapon carefully, but a gleeful smile lit his wrinkled, yellow face as he saw the splash of the ball where it struck the water almost at the side of the prahu.

　　Sing realized that the boat might contain friendly natives, but he had cruised these waters too many years to take chances. Better kill a hundred friends, he thought, than be captured by a single pirate.

　　At the shot the prahu slowed up, and a volley of musketry from her crew satisfied Sing that he had made no mistake in classifying her.  Her fire fell short as did the ball from the small cannon mounted in her bow.

　　Virginia was watching the prahu from one of the cabin ports.  She saw the momentary hesitation and confusion which followed Sing's first shot, and then to her dismay she saw the rowers bend to their oars again and the prahu move swiftly in the direction of the Ithaca.

　　It was apparent that the pirates had perceived the almost defenseless condition of the schooner.  In a few minutes they would be swarming the deck, for poor old Sing would be entirely helpless to repel them.  If Dr. von Horn were only there, thought the distracted girl. With the machine gun alone he might keep them off.

　　At the thought of the machine gun a sudden resolve gripped her.  Why not man it herself?  Von Horn had explained its mechanism to her in detail, and on one occasion had allowed her to operate it on the voyage from Singapore.  With the thought came action.  Running to the magazine she snatched up a feed-belt, and in another moment was on deck beside the astonished Sing.

　　The pirates were skimming rapidly across the smooth waters of the harbor, answering Sing's harmless shots with yells of derision and wild, savage war cries. There were, perhaps, fifty Dyaks and Malays--fierce, barbaric men; mostly naked to the waist, or with war- coats of brilliant colors.  The savage headdress of the Dyaks, the long, narrow, decorated shields, the flashing blades of parang and kris sent a shudder through the girl, so close they seemed beneath the schooner's side.

　　"What do?  What do?" cried Sing in consternation. "Go b'low.  Klick!"  But before he had finished his exhortation Virginia was racing toward the bow where the machine gun was mounted.  Tearing the cover from it she swung the muzzle toward the pirate prahu, which by now was nearly within range above the vessel's side-- a moment more and she would be too close to use the weapon upon the pirates.

　　Virginia was quick to perceive the necessity for haste, while the pirates at the same instant realized the menace of the new danger which confronted them.  A score of muskets belched forth their missiles at the fearless girl behind the scant shield of the machine gun.  Leaden pellets rained heavily upon her protection, or whizzed threateningly about her head-- and then she got the gun into action.

　　At the rate of fifty a minute, a stream of projectiles tore into the bow of the prahu when suddenly a richly garbed Malay in the stern rose to his feet waving a white cloth upon the point of his kris.  It was the Rajah Muda Saffir--he had seen the girl's face and at the sight of it the blood lust in his breast had been supplanted by another.

　　At sight of the emblem of peace Virginia ceased firing. She saw the tall Malay issue a few commands, the oarsmen bent to their work, the prahu came about, making off toward the harbor's entrance.  At the same moment there was a shot from the shore followed by loud yelling, and the girl turned to see her father and von Horn pulling rapidly toward the Ithaca.

　　2

　　THE HEAVY CHEST

　　Virginia and Sing were compelled to narrate the adventure of the afternoon a dozen times.  The Chinaman was at a loss to understand what had deterred the pirates at the very threshold of victory.  Von Horn thought that they had seen the reinforcements embarking from the shore, but Sing explained that that was impossible since the Ithaca had been directly between them and the point at which the returning crew had entered the boats.

　　Virginia was positive that her fusillade had frightened them into a hasty retreat, but again Sing discouraged any such idea when he pointed to the fact that another instant would have carried the prahu close to the Ithaca's side and out of the machine gun's radius of action.

　　The old Chinaman was positive that the pirates had some ulterior motive for simulating defeat, and his long years of experience upon pirate infested waters gave weight to his opinion.  The weak spot in his argument was his inability to suggest a reasonable motive.  And so it was that for a long time they were left to futile conjecture as to the action that had saved them from a bloody encounter with these bloodthirsty sea wolves.

　　For a week the men were busy constructing the new camp, but never again was Virginia left without a sufficient guard for her protection.  Von Horn was always needed at the work, for to him had fallen the entire direction of matters of importance that were at all of a practical nature.  Professor Maxon wished to watch the building of the houses and the stockade, that he might offer such suggestions as he thought necessary, and again the girl noticed her father's comparative indifference to her welfare.

　　She had been shocked at his apathy at the time of the pirate attack, and chagrined that it should have been necessary for von Horn to have insisted upon a proper guard being left with her thereafter.

　　The nearer the approach of the time when he might enter again upon those experiments which had now been neglected for the better part of a year the more self absorbed and moody became the professor.  At times he was scarcely civil to those about him, and never now did he have a pleasant word or a caress for the daughter who had been his whole life but a few short months before.

　　It often seemed to Virginia when she caught her father's eyes upon her that there was a gleam of dislike in them, as though he would have been glad to have been rid of her that she might not in any way embarrass or interfere with his work.

　　The camp was at last completed, and on a Saturday afternoon all the heavier articles from the ship had been transported to it.  On the following Monday the balance of the goods was to be sent on shore and the party were to transfer their residence to their new quarters.

　　Late Sunday afternoon a small native boat was seen rounding the point at the harbor's southern extremity, and after a few minutes it drew alongside the Ithaca. There were but three men in it--two Dyaks and a Malay. The latter was a tall, well built man of middle age, of a sullen and degraded countenance.  His garmenture was that of the ordinary Malay boatman, but there was that in his mien and his attitude toward his companions which belied his lowly habiliments.

　　In answer to von Horn's hail the man asked if he might come aboard and trade; but once on the deck it developed that he had not brought nothing wherewith to trade. He seemed not the slightest disconcerted by this discovery, stating that he would bring such articles as they wished when he had learned what their requirements were.

　　The ubiquitous Sing was on hand during the interview, but from his expressionless face none might guess what was passing through the tortuous channels of his Oriental mind.  The Malay had been aboard nearly half an hour talking with von Horn when the mate, Bududreen, came on deck, and it was Sing alone who noted the quickly concealed flash of recognition which passed between the two Malays.

　　The Chinaman also saw the gleam that shot into the visitor's eye as Virginia emerged from the cabin, but by no word or voluntary outward sign did the man indicate that he had even noticed her.  Shortly afterward he left, promising to return with provisions the following day. But it was to be months before they again saw him.

　　That evening as Sing was serving Virginia's supper he asked her if she had recognized their visitor of the afternoon.

　　"Why no, Sing," she replied, "I never saw him before."

　　"Sh!" admonished the celestial.  "No talkee so strong, wallee have ear all same labbit."

　　"What do you mean, Sing?" asked the girl in a low voice. "How perfectly weird and mysterious you are. Why you make the cold chills run up my spine," she ended, laughing.  But Sing did not return her smile as was his custom.

　　"You no lememba tallee Lajah stand up wavee lite clothee in plilate boat, ah?" he urged.

　　"Oh, Sing," she cried, "I do indeed!  But unless you had reminded me I should never have thought to connect him with our visitor of today--they do look very much alike, don't they?"

　　"Lookeelike!  Ugh, they all samee one man.  Sing know. You lookee out, Linee," which was the closest that Sing had ever been able to come to pronouncing Virginia.

　　"Why should I look out?  He doesn't want me," said the girl, laughingly.

　　"Don't you bee too damee sure 'bout lat, Linee," was Sing's inelegant but convincing reply, as he turned toward his galley.

　　The following morning the party, with the exception of three Malays who were left to guard the Ithaca, set out for the new camp.  The journey was up the bed of the small stream which emptied into the harbor, so that although fifteen men had passed back and forth through the jungle from the beach to the camp every day for two weeks, there was no sign that human foot had ever crossed the narrow strip of sand that lay between the dense foliage and the harbor.

　　The gravel bottom of the rivulet made fairly good walking, and as Virginia was borne in a litter between two powerful lascars it was not even necessary that she wet her feet in the ascent of the stream to the camp. The distance was short, the center of the camp being but a mile from the harbor, and less than half a mile from the opposite shore of the island which was but two miles at its greatest breadth, and two and a quarter at its greatest length.

　　At the camp Virginia found that a neat clearing had been made upon a little tableland, a palisade built about it, and divided into three parts; the most northerly of which contained a small house for herself and her father, another for von Horn, and a common cooking and eating house over which Sing was to preside.

　　The enclosure at the far end of the palisade was for the Malay and lascar crew and there also were quarters for Bududreen and the Malay second mate.  The center enclosure contained Professor Maxon's workshop.  This compartment of the enclosure Virginia was not invited to inspect, but as members of the crew carried in the two great chests which the professor had left upon the Ithaca until the last moment, Virginia caught a glimpse of the two buildings that had been erected within this central space--a small, square house which was quite evidently her father's laboratory, and a long, low thatched shed divided into several compartments, each containing a rude bunk.  She wondered for whom they could be intended.  Quarters for all the party had already been arranged for elsewhere, nor, thought she, would her father wish to house any in such close proximity to his workshop, where he would desire absolute quiet and freedom from interruption.  The discovery perplexed her not a little, but so changed were her relations with her father that she would not question him upon this or any other subject.

　　As the two chests were being carried into the central campong, Sing, who was standing near Virginia, called her attention to the fact that Bududreen was one of those who staggered beneath the weight of the heavier burden.

　　"Bludleen, him mate.  Why workee alsame lascar boy?  Eh?" But Virginia could give no reason.

　　"I am afraid you don't like Bududreen, Sing," she said. "Has he ever harmed you in any way?"

　　"Him?  No, him no hurt Sing.  Sing poor," with which more or less enigmatical rejoinder the Chinaman returned to his work.  But he muttered much to himself the balance of the day, for Sing knew that a chest that strained four men in the carrying could contain but one thing, and he knew that Bududreen was as wise in such matters as he.

　　For a couple of months the life of the little hidden camp went on peacefully and without exciting incident. The Malay and lascar crew divided their time between watch duty on board the Ithaca, policing the camp, and cultivating a little patch of clearing just south of their own campong.

　　There was a small bay on the island's east coast, only a quarter of a mile from camp, in which oysters were found, and one of the Ithaca's boats was brought around to this side of the island for fishing.  Bududreen often accompanied these expeditions, and on several occasions the lynx-eyed Sing had seen him returning to camp long after the others had retired for the night.

　　Professor Maxon scarcely ever left the central enclosure.  For days and nights at a time Virginia never saw him, his meals being passed in to him by Sing through a small trap door that had been cut in the partition wall of the "court of mystery" as von Horn had christened the section of the camp devoted to the professor's experimentations.

　　Von Horn himself was often with his employer as he enjoyed the latter's complete confidence, and owing to his early medical training was well fitted to act as a competent assistant; but he was often barred from the workshop, and at such times was much with Virginia.

　　The two took long walks through the untouched jungle, exploring their little island, and never failing to find some new and wonderful proof of Nature's creative power among its flora and fauna.

　　"What a marvellous thing is creation," exclaimed Virginia as she and von Horn paused one day to admire a tropical bird of unusually brilliant plumage. "How insignificant is man's greatest achievement beside the least of Nature's works."

　　"And yet," replied von Horn, "man shall find Nature's secret some day.  What a glorious accomplishment for him who first succeeds.  Can you imagine a more glorious consummation of a man's life work--your father's, for example?"

　　The girl looked at von Horn closely.

　　"Dr. von Horn," she said, "pride has restrained me from asking what was evidently intended that I should not know.  For years my father has been interested in an endeavor to solve the mystery of life--that he would ever attempt to utilize the secret should he have been so fortunate as to discover it had never occurred to me.  I mean that he should try to usurp the functions of the Creator I could never have believed, but my knowledge of him, coupled with what you have said, and the extreme lengths to which he has gone to maintain absolute secrecy for his present experiments can only lead to one inference; and that, that his present work, if successful, would have results that would not be countenanced by civilized society or government. Am I right?"

　　Von Horn had attempted to sound the girl that he might, if possible, discover her attitude toward the work in which her father and he were engaged.  He had succeeded beyond his hopes, for he had not intended that she should guess so much of the truth as she had.  Should her interest in the work have proved favorable it had been his intention to acquaint her fully with the marvellous success which already had attended their experiments, and to explain their hopes and plans for the future, for he had seen how her father's attitude had hurt her and hoped to profit himself by reposing in her the trust and confidence that her father denied her.

　　And so it was that her direct question left him floundering in a sea of embarrassment, for to tell her the truth now would gain him no favor in her eyes, while it certainly would lay him open to the suspicion and distrust of her father should he learn of it.

　　"I cannot answer your question, Miss Maxon," he said, finally, "for your father's strictest injunction has been that I divulge to no one the slightest happening within the court of mystery.  Remember that I am in your father's employ, and that no matter what my personal convictions may be regarding the work he has been doing I may only act with loyalty to his lightest command while I remain upon his payroll.  That you are here," he added, "is my excuse for continuing my connection with certain things of which my conscience does not approve."

　　The girl glanced at him quickly.  She did not fully understand the motive for his final avowal, and a sudden intuition kept her from questioning him.  She had learned to look upon von Horn as a very pleasant companion and a good friend--she was not quite certain that she would care for any change in their relations, but his remark had sowed the seed of a new thought in her mind as he had intended that it should.

　　When von Horn returned to the court of mystery, he narrated to Professor Maxon the gist of his conversation with Virginia, wishing to forestall anything which the girl might say to her father that would give him an impression that von Horn had been talking more than he should.  Professor Maxon listened to the narration in silence.  When von Horn had finished, he cautioned him against divulging to Virginia anything that took place within the inner campong.

　　"She is only a child," he said, "and would not understand the importance of the work we are doing. All that she would be able to see is the immediate moral effect of these experiments upon the subjects themselves--she would not look into the future and appreciate the immense advantage to mankind that must accrue from a successful termination of our research. The future of the world will be assured when once we have demonstrated the possibility of the chemical production of a perfect race."

　　"Number One, for example," suggested von Horn.

　　Professor Maxon glanced at him sharply.

　　"Levity, Doctor, is entirely out of place in the contemplation of the magnificent work I have already accomplished," said the professor tartly.  "I admit that Number One leaves much to be desired--much to be desired; but Number Two shows a marked advance along certain lines, and I am sure that tomorrow will divulge in experiment Number Three such strides as will forever silence any propensity toward scoffing which you may now entertain."

　　"Forgive me, Professor," von Horn hastened to urge. "I did not intend to deride the wonderful discoveries which you have made, but it is only natural that we should both realize that Number One is not beautiful. To one another we may say what we would not think of suggesting to outsiders."

　　Professor Maxon was mollified by this apology, and turned to resume his watch beside a large, coffin-shaped vat.  For a while von Horn was silent. There was that upon his mind which he had wished to discuss with his employer since months ago, but the moment had never arrived which seemed at all propitious, nor did it appear likely ever to arrive.  So the doctor decided to broach the subject now, as being psychologically as favorable a time as any.

　　"Your daughter is far from happy, Professor," he said, "nor do I feel that, surrounded as we are by semi-savage men, she is entirely safe."

　　Professor Maxon looked up from his vigil by the vat, eyeing von Horn closely.

　　"Well?" he asked.

　　"It seemed to me that had I a closer relationship I might better assist in adding to her happiness and safety--in short, Professor, I should like your permission to ask Virginia to marry me."

　　There had been no indication in von Horn's attitude toward the girl that he loved her.  That she was beautiful and intelligent could not be denied, and so it was small wonder that she might appeal strongly to any man, but von Horn was quite evidently not of the marrying type.  For years he had roved the world in search of adventure and excitement.  Just why he had left America and his high place in the navy he never had divulged; nor why it was that for seven years he had not set his foot upon ground which lay beneath the authority of Uncle Sam.

　　Sing Lee who stood just without the trap door through which he was about to pass Professor Maxon's evening meal to him could not be blamed for overhearing the conversation, though it may have been culpable in him in making no effort to divulge his presence, and possibly equally unpraiseworthy, as well as lacking in romance, to attribute the doctor's avowal to his knowledge of the heavy chest.

　　As Professor Maxon eyed the man before replying to his abrupt request, von Horn noted a strange and sudden light in the older man's eyes--a something which he never before had seen there and which caused an uncomfortable sensation to creep over him--a manner of bristling that was akin either to fear or horror, von Horn could not tell which.

　　Then the professor arose from his seat and came very close to the younger man, until his face was only a few inches from von Horn's.

　　"Doctor," he whispered in a strange, tense voice, "you are mad.  You do not know what you ask.  Virginia is not for such as you.  Tell me that she does not know of your feelings toward her.  Tell me that she does not reciprocate your love.  Tell me the truth, man." Professor Maxon seized von Horn roughly by both shoulders, his glittering eyes glaring terribly into the other's.

　　"I have never spoken to her of love, Professor," replied von Horn quietly, "nor do I know what her sentiments toward me may be.  Nor do I understand, sir, what objections you may have to me--I am of a very old and noble family."  His tone was haughty but respectful.

　　Professor Maxon released his hold upon his assistant, breathing a sigh of relief.

　　"I am glad," he said, "that it has gone no further, for it must not be.  I have other, nobler aspirations for my daughter. She must wed a perfect man--none such now exists. It remains for me to bring forth the ideal mate for her-- nor is the time far distant.  A few more weeks and we shall see such a being as I have long dreamed." Again the queer light flickered for a moment in the once kindly and jovial eyes of the scientist.

　　Von Horn was horrified.  He was a man of little sentiment. He could in cold blood have married this girl for the wealth he knew that she would inherit; but the thought that she was to be united with such a THING-- "Lord!  It is horrible," and his mind pictured the fearful atrocity which was known as Number One.

　　Without a word he turned and left the campong.  A moment later Sing's knock aroused Professor Maxon from the reverie into which he had fallen, and he stepped to the trap door to receive his evening meal.

　　BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

　　One day, about two weeks later, von Horn and the professor were occupied closely with their work in the court of mystery.  Developments were coming in riotous confusion.  A recent startling discovery bade fare to simplify and expedite the work far beyond the fondest dreams of the scientist.

　　Von Horn's interest in the marvellous results that had been obtained was little short of the professor's-- but he foresaw a very different outcome of it all, and by day never moved without a gun at either hip, and by night both of them were beside him.

　　Sing Lee, the noonday meal having been disposed of, set forth with rod, string and bait to snare gulls upon the beach.  He moved quietly through the jungle, his sharp eyes and ears always alert for anything that might savor of the unusual, and so it was that he saw the two men upon the beach, while they did not see him at all.

　　They were Bududreen and the same tall Malay whom Sing had seen twice before--once in splendid raiment and commanding the pirate prahu, and again as a simple boatman come to the Ithaca to trade, but without the goods to carry out his professed intentions.

　　The two squatted on the beach at the edge of the jungle a short distance above the point at which Sing had been about to emerge when he discovered them, so that it was but the work of a moment or two for the Chinaman to creep stealthily through the dense underbrush to a point directly above them and not three yards from where they conversed in low tones--yet sufficiently loud that Sing missed not a word.

　　"I tell you, Bududreen, that it will be quite safe," the tall Malay was saying.  "You yourself tell me that none knows of the whereabouts of these white men, and if they do not return your word will be accepted as to their fate.  Your reward will be great if you bring the girl to me, and if you doubt the loyalty of any of your own people a kris will silence them as effectually as it will silence the white men."

　　"It is not fear of the white men, oh, Rajah Muda Saffir, that deters me," said Bududreen, "but how shall I know that after I have come to your country with the girl I shall not myself be set upon and silenced with a golden kris--there be many that will be jealous of the great service I have done for the mighty rajah."

　　Muda Saffir knew perfectly well that Bududreen had but diplomatically expressed a fear as to his own royal trustworthiness, but it did not anger him, since the charge was not a direct one; but what he did not know was of the heavy chest and Bududreen's desire to win the price of the girl and yet be able to save for himself a chance at the far greater fortune which he knew lay beneath that heavy oaken lid.

　　Both men had arisen now and were walking across the beach toward a small, native canoe in which Muda Saffir had come to the meeting place.  They were out of earshot before either spoke again, so that what further passed between them Sing could not even guess, but he had heard enough to confirm the suspicions he had entertained for a long while.

　　He did not fish for gulls that day.  Bududreen and Muda Saffir stood talking upon the beach, and the Chinaman did not dare venture forth for fear they might suspect that he had overheard them.  If old Sing Lee knew his Malays, he was also wise enough to give them credit for knowing their Chinamen, so he waited quietly in hiding until Muda Saffir had left, and Bududreen returned to camp.

　　Professor Maxon and von Horn were standing over one of the six vats that were arranged in two rows down the center of the laboratory.  The professor had been more communicative and agreeable today than for some time past, and their conversation had assumed more of the familiarity that had marked it during the first month of their acquaintance at Singapore.

　　"And what of these first who are so imperfect?" asked von Horn.  "You cannot take them into civilization, nor would it be right to leave them here upon this island. What will you do with them?"

　　Professor Maxon pondered the question for a moment.

　　"I have given the matter but little thought," he said at length.  "They are but the accidents of my great work.  It is unfortunate that they are as they are, but without them I could have never reached the perfection that I am sure we are to find here," and he tapped lovingly upon the heavy glass cover of the vat before which he stood.  "And this is but the beginning.  There can be no more mistakes now, though I doubt if we can ever improve upon that which is so rapidly developing here." Again he passed his long, slender hand caressingly over the coffin-like vat at the head of which was a placard bearing the words, NUMBER THIRTEEN.

　　"But the others, Professor!" insisted von Horn. "We must decide.  Already they have become a problem of no small dimensions.  Yesterday Number Five desired some plantains that I had given to Number Seven.  I tried to reason with him, but, as you know, he is mentally defective, and for answer he rushed at Number Seven to tear the coveted morsel from him.  The result was a battle royal that might have put to shame two Bengal tigers.  Twelve is tractable and intelligent.  With his assistance and my bull whip I succeeded in separating them before either was killed.  Your greatest error was in striving at first for such physical perfection.  You have overdone it, with the result that the court of mystery is peopled by a dozen brutes of awful muscularity, and scarcely enough brain among the dozen to equip three properly."

　　"They are as they are," replied the professor. "I shall do for them what I can--when I am gone they must look to themselves.  I can see no way out of it."

　　"What you have given you may take away," said von Horn, in a low tone.

　　Professor Maxon shuddered.  Those three horrid days in the workshop at Ithaca flooded his memory with all the gruesome details he had tried for so many months to forget.  The haunting ghosts of the mental anguish that had left him an altered man--so altered that there were times when he had feared for his sanity!

　　"No, no!" he almost shouted.  "It would be murder. They are--"

　　"They are THINGS," interrupted von Horn.  "They are not human--they are not even beast.  They are terrible, soulless creatures.  You have no right to permit them to live longer than to substantiate your theory.  None but us knows of their existence--no other need know of their passing.  It must be done.  They are a constant and growing menace to us all, but most of all to your daughter."

　　A cunning look came into the professor's eyes.

　　"I understand," he said.  "The precedent once established, all must perish by its edict--even those which may not be grotesque or bestial--even this perfect one," and he touched again the vat, "and thus you would rid yourself of rival suitors. But no!" he went on in a high, trembling voice.  "I shall not be led to thus compromise myself, and be thwarted in my cherished plan. Be this one what he may he shall wed my daughter!"

　　The man had raised himself upon his toes as he reached his climax--his clenched hand was high above his head-- his voice fairly thundered out the final sentence, and with the last word he brought his fist down upon the vat before him.  In his eyes blazed the light of unchained madness.

　　Von Horn was a brave man, but he shuddered at the maniacal ferocity of the older man, and shrank back. The futility of argument was apparent, and he turned and left the workshop.

　　Sing Lee was late that night.  In fact he did not return from his fruitless quest for gulls until well after dark, nor would he vouchsafe any explanation of the consequent lateness of supper.  Nor could he be found shortly after the evening meal when Virginia sought him.

　　Not until the camp was wrapped in the quiet of slumber did Sing Lee return--stealthy and mysterious--to creep under cover of a moonless night to the door of the workshop.  How he gained entrance only Sing Lee knows, but a moment later there was a muffled crash of broken glass within the laboratory, and the Chinaman had slipped out, relocked the door, and scurried to his nearby shack.  But there was no occasion for his haste-- no other ear than his had heard the sound within the workshop.

　　It was almost nine the following morning before Professor Maxon and von Horn entered the laboratory. Scarcely had the older man passed the doorway than he drew up his hands in horrified consternation.  Vat Number Thirteen lay dashed to the floor--the glass cover was broken to a million pieces--a sticky, brownish substance covered the matting. Professor Maxon hid his face in his hands.

　　"God!" he cried.  "It is all ruined.  Three more days would have--"

　　"Look!" cried von Horn.  "It is not too soon."

　　Professor Maxon mustered courage to raise his eyes from his hands, and there he beheld, seated in a far corner of the room a handsome giant, physically perfect.  The creature looked about him in a dazed, uncomprehending manner.  A great question was writ large upon his intelligent countenance.  Professor Maxon stepped forward and took him by the hand.

　　"Come," he said, and led him toward a smaller room off the main workshop.  The giant followed docilely, his eyes roving about the room--the pitiful questioning still upon his handsome features.  Von Horn turned toward the campong.

　　Virginia, deserted by all, even the faithful Sing, who, cheated of his sport on the preceding day, had again gone to the beach to snare gulls, became restless of the enforced idleness and solitude.  For a time she wandered about the little compound which had been reserved for the whites, but tiring of this she decided to extend her stroll beyond the palisade, a thing which she had never before done unless accompanied by von Horn-- a thing both he and her father had cautioned her against.

　　"What danger can there be?" she thought.  "We know that the island is uninhabited by others than ourselves, and that there are no dangerous beasts.  And, anyway, there is no one now who seems to care what becomes of me, unless--unless--I wonder if he does care.  I wonder if I care whether or not he cares.  Oh, dear, I wish I knew," and as she soliloquized she wandered past the little clearing and into the jungle that lay behind the campong.

　　As von Horn and Professor Maxon talked together in the laboratory before the upsetting of vat Number Thirteen, a grotesque and horrible creature had slunk from the low shed at the opposite side of the campong until it had crouched at the flimsy door of the building in which the two men conversed.  For a while it listened intently, but when von Horn urged the necessity for dispatching certain "terrible, soulless creatures" an expression of intermingled fear and hatred convulsed the hideous features, and like a great grizzly it turned and lumbered awkwardly across the campong toward the easterly, or back wall of the enclosure.

　　Here it leaped futilely a half dozen times for the top of the palisade, and then trembling and chattering in rage it ran back and forth along the base of the obstacle, just as a wild beast in captivity paces angrily before the bars of its cage.

　　Finally it paused to look once more at the senseless wood that barred its escape, as though measuring the distance to the top.  Then the eyes roamed about the campong to rest at last upon the slanting roof of the thatched shed which was its shelter.  Presently a slow idea was born in the poor, malformed brain.

　　The creature approached the shed.  He could just reach the saplings that formed the frame work of the roof. Like a huge sloth he drew himself to the roof of the structure.  From here he could see beyond the palisade, and the wild freedom of the jungle called to him.  He did not know what it was but in its leafy wall he perceived many breaks and openings that offered concealment from the creatures who were plotting to take his life.

　　Yet the wall was not fully six feet from him, and the top of it at least five feet above the top of the shed-- those who had designed the campong had been careful to set this structure sufficiently far from the palisade to prevent its forming too easy an avenue of escape.

　　The creature glanced fearfully toward the workshop. He remembered the cruel bull whip that always followed each new experiment on his part that did not coincide with the desires of his master, and as he thought of von Horn a nasty gleam shot his mismated eyes.

　　He tried to reach across the distance between the roof and the palisade, and in the attempt lost his balance and nearly precipitated himself to the ground below. Cautiously he drew back, still looking about for some means to cross the chasm.  One of the saplings of the roof, protruding beyond the palm leaf thatch, caught his attention.  With a single wrench he tore it from its fastenings.  Extending it toward the palisade he discovered that it just spanned the gap, but he dared not attempt to cross upon its single slender strand.

　　Quickly he ripped off a half dozen other poles from the roof, and laying them side by side, formed a safe and easy path to freedom.  A moment more and he sat astride the top of the wall.  Drawing the poles after him, he dropped them one by one to the ground outside the campong.  Then he lowered himself to liberty.

　　Gathering the saplings under one huge arm he ran, lumberingly, into the jungle.  He would not leave evidence of the havoc he had wrought; the fear of the bull whip was still strong upon him.  The green foliage closed about him and the peaceful jungle gave no sign of the horrid brute that roamed its shadowed mazes.

　　As von Horn stepped into the campong his quick eye perceived the havoc that had been wrought with the roof at the east end of the shed.  Quickly he crossed to the low structure.  Within its compartments a number of deformed monsters squatted upon their haunches, or lay prone upon the native mats that covered the floor.

　　As the man entered they looked furtively at the bull whip which trailed from his right hand, and then glanced fearfully at one another as though questioning which was the malefactor on this occasion.

　　Von Horn ran his eyes over the hideous assemblage.

　　"Where is Number One?" he asked, directing his question toward a thing whose forehead gave greater promise of intelligence than any of his companions.

　　The one addressed shook his head.

　　Von Horn turned and made a circuit of the campong. There was no sign of the missing one and no indication of any other irregularity than the demolished portion of the roof.  With an expression of mild concern upon his face he entered the workshop.

　　"Number One has escaped into the jungle, Professor," he said.

　　Professor Maxon looked up in surprise, but before he had an opportunity to reply a woman's scream, shrill with horror, smote upon their startled ears.

　　Von Horn was the first to reach the campong of the whites.  Professor Maxon was close behind him, and the faces of both were white with apprehension. The enclosure was deserted.  Not even Sing was there. Without a word the two men sprang through the gateway and raced for the jungle in the direction from which that single, haunting cry had come.

　　Virginia Maxon, idling beneath the leafy shade of the tropical foliage, became presently aware that she had wandered farther from the campong than she had intended. The day was sultry, and the heat, even in the dense shade of the jungle, oppressive.  Slowly she retraced her steps, her eyes upon the ground, her mind absorbed in sad consideration of her father's increasing moodiness and eccentricity.

　　Possibly it was this very abstraction which deadened her senses to the near approach of another.  At any rate the girl's first intimation that she was not alone came when she raised her eyes to look full into the horrid countenance of a fearsome monster which blocked her path toward camp.

　　The sudden shock brought a single involuntary scream from her lips.  And who can wonder!  The thing thrust so unexpectedly before her eyes was hideous in the extreme.  A great mountain of deformed flesh clothed in dirty, white cotton pajamas!  Its face was of the ashen hue of a fresh corpse, while the white hair and pink eyes denoted the absence of pigment; a characteristic of albinos.

　　One eye was fully twice the diameter of the other, and an inch above the horizontal plane of its tiny mate. The nose was but a gaping orifice above a deformed and twisted mouth.  The thing was chinless, and its small, foreheadless head surrounded its colossal body like a cannon ball on a hill top.  One arm was at least twelve inches longer than its mate, which was itself long in proportion to the torso, while the legs, similarly mismated and terminating in huge, flat feet that protruded laterally, caused the thing to lurch fearfully from side to side as it lumbered toward the girl.

　　A sudden grimace lighted the frightful face as the grotesque eyes fell upon this new creature.  Number One had never before seen a woman, but the sight of this one awoke in the unplumbed depths of his soulless breast a great desire to lay his hands upon her.  She was very beautiful.  Number One wished to have her for his very own; nor would it be a difficult matter, so fragile was she, to gather her up in those great, brute arms and carry her deep into the jungle far out of hearing of the bull-whip man and the cold, frowning one who was continually measuring and weighing Number One and his companions, the while he scrutinized them with those strange, glittering eyes that frightened one even more than the cruel lash of the bull whip.

　　Number One lurched forward, his arms outstretched toward the horror stricken girl.  Virginia tried to cry out again--she tried to turn and run; but the horror of her impending fate and the terror that those awful features induced left her paralyzed and helpless.

　　The thing was almost upon her now.  The mouth was wide in a hideous attempt to smile.  The great hands would grasp her in another second--and then there was a sudden crashing of the underbrush behind her, a yellow, wrinkled face and a flying pig-tail shot past her, and the brave old Sing Lee grappled with the mighty monster that threatened her.

　　The battle was short--short and terrible.  The valiant Chinaman sought the ashen throat of his antagonist, but his wiry, sinewy muscles were as reeds beneath the force of that inhuman power that opposed them.  Holding the girl at arm's length in one hand, Number One tore the battling Chinaman from him with the other, and lifting him bodily above his head, hurled him stunned and bleeding against the bole of a giant buttress tree. Then lifting Virginia in his arms once more he dived into the impenetrable mazes of the jungle that lined the more open pathway between the beach and camp.

　　4

　　A NEW FACE

　　As Professor Maxon and von Horn rushed from the workshop to their own campong, they neglected, in their haste, to lock the door between, and for the first time since the camp was completed it stood unlatched and ajar.

　　The professor had been engaged in taking careful measurements of the head of his latest experiment, the while he coached the young man in the first rudiments of spoken language, and now the subject of his labors found himself suddenly deserted and alone.  He had not yet been without the four walls of the workshop, as the professor had wished to keep him from association with the grotesque results of his earlier experiments, and now a natural curiosity tempted him to approach the door through which his creator and the man with the bull whip had so suddenly disappeared.

　　He saw before him a great walled enclosure roofed by a lofty azure dome, and beyond the walls the tops of green trees swaying gently in the soft breezes.  His nostrils tasted the incense of fresh earth and growing things.  For the first time he felt the breath of Nature, free and unconfined, upon his brow.

　　He drew his giant frame to its full height and drank in the freedom and the sweetness of it all, filling his great lungs to their fullest; and with the first taste he learned to hate the close and stuffy confines of his prison.

　　His virgin mind was filled with wonder at the wealth of new impressions which surged to his brain through every sense.  He longed for more, and the open gateway of the campong was a scarce needed invitation to pass to the wide world beyond.  With the free and easy tread of utter unconsciousness of self, he passed across the enclosure and stepped out into the clearing which lay between the palisade and the jungle.

　　Ah, here was a still more beautiful world!  The green leaves nodded to him, and at their invitation he came and the jungle reached out its million arms to embrace him.  Now before him, behind, on either side there was naught but glorious green beauty shot with splashes of gorgeous color that made him gasp in wonderment.

　　Brilliant birds rose from amidst it all, skimming hither and thither above his head--he thought that the flowers and the birds were the same, and when he reached out and plucked a blossom, tenderly, he wondered that it did not flutter in his hand. On and on he walked, but slowly, for he must not miss a single sight in the strange and wonderful place; and then, of a sudden, the quiet beauty of the scene was harshly broken by the crashing of a monster through the underbrush.

　　Number Thirteen was standing in a little open place in the jungle when the discordant note first fell upon his ears, and as he turned his head in the direction of the sound he was startled at the hideous aspect of the thing which broke through the foliage before him.

　　What a horrid creature!  But on the same instant his eyes fell upon another borne in the arms of the terrible one. This one was different--very different,-- soft and beautiful and white.  He wondered what it all meant, for everything was strange and new to him; but when he saw the eyes of the lovely one upon him, and her arms outstretched toward him, though he did  not understand the words upon her lips, he knew that she was in distress.  Something told him that it was the ugly thing that carried her that was the author of her suffering.

　　Virginia Maxon had been half unconscious from fright when she suddenly saw a white man, clothed in coarse, white, native pajamas, confronting her and the misshapen beast that was bearing her away to what frightful fate she could but conjecture.

　　At the sight of the man her voice returned with returning hope, and she reached her arms toward him, calling upon him to save her.  Although he did not respond she thought that he understood for he sprang toward them before her appeal was scarce uttered.

　　As before, when Sing had threatened to filch his new possession from him, Number One held the girl with one hand while he met the attack of this new assailant with the other; but here was very different metal than had succumbed to him before.

　　It is true that Number Thirteen knew nothing whatever of personal combat, but Number One had but little advantage of him in the matter of experience, while the former was equipped with great natural intelligence as well as steel muscles no whit less powerful than his deformed predecessor.

　　So it was that the awful giant found his single hand helpless to cope with the strength of his foeman, and in a brief instant felt powerful fingers clutching at his throat.  Still reluctant to surrender his hold upon his prize, he beat futilely at the face of his enemy, but at last the agony of choking compelled him to drop the girl and grapple madly with the man who choked him with one hand and rained mighty and merciless blows upon his face and head with the other.

　　His captive sank to the ground, too weak from the effects of nervous shock to escape, and with horror- filled eyes watched the two who battled over her.  She saw that her would-be rescuer was young and strong featured--all together a very fine specimen of manhood; and to her great wonderment it was soon apparent that he was no unequal match for the great mountain of muscle that he fought.

　　Both tore and struck and clawed and bit in the frenzy of mad, untutored strife, rolling about on the soft carpet of the jungle almost noiselessly except for their heavy breathing and an occasional beast-like snarl from Number One.  For several minutes they fought thus until the younger man succeeded in getting both hands upon the throat of his adversary, and then, choking relentlessly, he raised the brute with him from the ground and rushed him fiercely backward against the stem of a tree.  Again and again he hurled the monstrous thing upon the unyielding wood, until at last it hung helpless and inert in his clutches, then he cast it from him, and without another glance at it turned toward the girl.

　　Here was a problem indeed.  Now that he had won her, what was he to do with her?  He was but an adult child, with the brain and brawn of a man, and the ignorance and inexperience of the new-born.  And so he acted as a child acts, in imitation of what it has seen others do. The brute had been carrying the lovely creature, therefore that must be the thing for him to do, and so he stooped and gathered Virginia Maxon in his great arms.

　　She tried to tell him that she could walk after a moment's rest, but it was soon evident that he did not understand her, as a puzzled expression came to his face and he did not put her down as she asked.  Instead he stood irresolute for a time, and then moved slowly through the jungle.  By chance his direction was toward the camp, and this fact so relieved the girl's mind that presently she was far from loath to remain quietly in his arms.

　　After a moment she gained courage to look up into his face.  She thought that she never had seen so marvellously clean cut features, or a more high and noble countenance, and she wondered how it was that this white man was upon the island and she not have known it.  Possibly he was a new arrival--his presence unguessed even by her father.  That he was neither English nor American was evident from the fact that he could not understand her native tongue.  Who could he be! What was he doing upon their island!

　　As she watched his face he suddenly turned his eyes down upon her, and as she looked hurriedly away she was furious with herself as she felt a crimson flush mantle her cheek.  The man only half sensed, in a vague sort of way, the meaning of the tell tale color and the quickly averted eyes; but he became suddenly aware of the pressure of her delicate body against his, as he had not been before.  Now he kept his eyes upon her face as he walked, and a new emotion filled his breast. He did not understand it, but it was very pleasant, and he knew that it was because of the radiant thing that he carried in his arms.

　　The scream that had startled von Horn and Professor Maxon led them along the trail toward the east coast of the island, and about halfway of the distance they stumbled upon the dazed and bloody Sing just as he was on the point of regaining consciousness.

　　"For God's sake, Sing, what is the matter?" cried von Horn. "Where is Miss Maxon?"

　　"Big blute, he catchem Linee.  Tly kill Sing.  Head hit tlee. No see any more.  Wakee up--all glone," moaned the Chinaman as he tried to gain his feet.

　　"Which way did he take her?" urged von Horn.

　　Sing's quick eyes scanned the surrounding jungle, and in a moment, staggering to his feet, he cried, "Look see, klick!  Foot plint!" and ran, weak and reeling drunkenly, along the broad trail made by the giant creature and its prey.

　　Von Horn and Professor Maxon followed closely in Sing's wake, the younger man horrified by the terrible possibilities that obtruded themselves into his imagination despite his every effort to assure himself that no harm could come to Virginia Maxon before they reached her.  The girl's father had not spoken since they discovered that she was missing from the campong, but his face was white and drawn; his eyes wide and glassy as those of one whose mind is on the verge of madness from a great nervous shock.

　　The trail of the creature was bewilderingly erratic. A dozen paces straight through the underbrush, then a sharp turn at right angles for no apparent reason, only to veer again suddenly in a new direction!  Thus, turning and twisting, the tortuous way led them toward the south end of the island, until Sing, who was in advance, gave a sharp cry of surprise.

　　"Klick!  Look see!" he cried excitedly.  "Blig blute dead-- vely muchee dead."

　　Von Horn rushed forward to where the Chinaman was leaning over the body of Number One.  Sure enough, the great brute lay motionless, its horrid face even more hideous in death than in life, if it were possible. The face was black, the tongue protruded, the skin was bruised from the heavy fists of his assailant and the thick skull crushed and splintered from terrific impact with the tree.

　　Professor Maxon leaned over von Horn's shoulder. "Ah, poor Number One," he sighed, "that you should have come to such an untimely end--my child, my child."

　　Von Horn looked at him, a tinge of compassion in his rather hard face.  It touched the man that his employer was at last shocked from the obsession of his work to a realization of the love and duty he owed his daughter; he thought that the professor's last words referred to Virginia.

　　"Though there are twelve more," continued Professor Maxon, "you were my first born son and I loved you most, dear child."

　　The younger man was horrified.

　　"My God, Professor!" he cried.  "Are you mad?  Can you call this thing `child' and mourn over it when you do not yet know the fate of your own daughter?"

　　Professor Maxon looked up sadly.  "You do not understand, Dr. von Horn," he replied coldly, "and you will oblige me, in the future, by not again referring to the offspring of my labors as `things.'"

　　With an ugly look upon his face von Horn turned his back upon the older man--what little feeling of loyalty and affection he had ever felt for him gone forever. Sing was looking about for evidences of the cause of Number One's death and the probable direction in which Virginia Maxon had disappeared.

　　"What on earth could have killed this enormous brute, Sing? Have you any idea?" asked von Horn.

　　The Chinaman shook his head.

　　"No savvy," he replied.  "Blig flight.  Look see," and he pointed to the torn and trampled turf, the broken bushes, and to one or two small trees that had been snapped off by the impact of the two mighty bodies that had struggled back and forth about the little clearing.

　　"This way," cried Sing presently, and started off once more into the brush, but this time in a northwesterly direction, toward camp.

　　In silence the three men followed the new trail, all puzzled beyond measure to account for the death of Number One at the hands of what must have been a creature of superhuman strength.  What could it have been!  It was impossible that any of the Malays or lascars could have done the thing, and there were no other creatures, brute or human, upon the island large enough to have coped even for an instant with the ferocious brutality of the dead monster, except-- von Horn's brain came to a sudden halt at the thought. Could it be?  There seemed no other explanation. Virginia Maxon had been rescued from one soulless monstrosity to fall into the hands of another equally irresponsible and terrifying.

　　Others then must have escaped from the campong. Von Horn loosened his guns in their holsters, and took a fresh grip upon his bull whip as he urged Sing forward upon the trail.  He wondered which one it was, but not once did it occur to him that the latest result of Professor Maxon's experiments could be the rescuer of Virginia Maxon.  In his mind he could see only the repulsive features of one of the others.

　　Quite unexpectedly they came upon the two, and with a shout von Horn leaped forward, his bull whip upraised. Number Thirteen turned in surprise at the cry, and sensing a new danger for her who lay in his arms, he set her gently upon the ground behind him and advanced to meet his assailant.

　　"Out of the way, you--monstrosity," cried von Horn. "If you have harmed Miss Maxon I'll put a bullet in your heart!"

　　Number Thirteen did not understand the words that the other addressed to him but he interpreted the man's actions as menacing, not to himself, but to the creature he now considered his particular charge; and so he met the advancing man, more to keep him from the girl than to offer him bodily injury for he recognized him as one of the two who had greeted his first dawning consciousness.

　　Von Horn, possibly intentionally, misinterpreted the other's motive, and raising his bull whip struck Number Thirteen a vicious cut across the face, at the same time levelling his revolver point blank at the broad beast. But before ever he could pull the trigger an avalanche of muscle was upon him, and he went down to the rotting vegetation of the jungle with five sinewy fingers at his throat.

　　His revolver exploded harmlessly in the air, and then another hand wrenched it from him and hurled it far into the underbrush.  Number Thirteen knew nothing of the danger of firearms, but the noise had startled him and his experience with the stinging cut of the bull whip convinced him that this other was some sort of instrument of torture of which it would be as well to deprive his antagonist.

　　Virginia Maxon looked on in horror as she realized that her rescuer was quickly choking Dr. von Horn to death. With a little cry she sprang to her feet and ran toward them, just as her father emerged from the underbrush through which he had been struggling in the trail of the agile Chinaman and von Horn.  Placing her hand upon the great wrist of the giant she tried to drag his fingers from von Horn's throat, pleading meanwhile with both voice and eyes for the life of the man she thought loved her.

　　Again Number Thirteen translated the intent without understanding the words, and releasing von Horn permitted him to rise.  With a bound he was upon his feet and at the same instant brought his other gun from his side and levelled it upon the man who had released him; but as his finger tightened upon the trigger Virginia Maxon sprang between them and grasping von Horn's wrist deflected the muzzle of the gun just as the cartridge exploded. Simultaneously Professor Maxon sprang from his grasp and hurled him back with the superhuman strength of a maniac.

　　"Fool!" he cried.  "What would you do?  Kill--," and then of a sudden he realized his daughter's presence and the necessity for keeping the origin of the young giant from her knowledge.

　　"I am surprised at you, Dr. von Horn," he continued in a more level voice.  "You must indeed have forgotten yourself to thus attack a stranger upon our island until you know whether he be friend or foe.  Come! Escort my daughter to the camp, while I make the proper apologies to this gentleman."  As he saw that both Virginia and von Horn hesitated, he repeated his command in a peremptory tone, adding; "Quick, now; do as I bid you."

　　The moment had given von Horn an opportunity to regain his self-control, and realizing as well as did his employer, but from another motive, the necessity of keeping the truth from the girl, he took her arm and led her gently from the scene. At Professor Maxon's direction Sing accompanied them.

　　Now in Number Thirteen's brief career he had known no other authority than Professor Maxon's, and so it was that when his master laid a hand upon his wrist he remained beside him while another walked away with the lovely creature he had thought his very own.

　　Until after dark the professor kept the young man hidden in the jungle, and then, safe from detection, led him back to the laboratory.

　　5

　　TREASON

　　On their return to camp after her rescue Virginia talked a great deal to von Horn about the young giant who had rescued her, until the man feared that she was more interested in him than seemed good for his own plans.

　　He had now cast from him the last vestige of his loyalty for his employer, and thus freed had determined to use every means within his power to win Professor Maxon's daughter, and with her the heritage of wealth which he knew would be hers should her father, through some unforeseen mishap, meet death before he could return to civilization and alter his will, a contingency which von Horn knew he might have to consider should he marry the girl against her father's wishes, and thus thwart the crazed man's mad, but no less dear project.

　　He realized that first he must let the girl fully understand the grave peril in which she stood, and turn her hope of protection from her father to himself. He imagined that the initial step in undermining Virginia's confidence in her father would be to narrate every detail of the weird experiments which Professor Maxon had brought to such successful issues during their residence upon the island.

　　The girl's own questioning gave him the lead he needed.

　　"Where could that horrid creature have come from that set upon me in the jungle and nearly killed poor Sing?" she asked.

　　For a moment von Horn was silent, in well simulated hesitancy to reply to her query.

　　"I cannot tell you, Miss Maxon," he said sadly, "how much I should hate to be the one to ignore your father's commands, and enlighten you upon this and other subjects which lie nearer to your personal welfare than you can possibly guess; but I feel that after the horrors of this day duty demands that I must lay all before you--you cannot again be exposed to the horrors from which you were rescued only by a miracle."

　　"I cannot imagine what you hint at, Dr. von Horn," said Virginia, "but if to explain to me will necessitate betraying my father's confidence I prefer that you remain silent."

　　"You do not understand," broke in the man, "you cannot guess the horrors that I have seen upon this island, or the worse horrors that are to come.  Could you dream of what lies in store for you, you would seek death rather than face the future.  I have been loyal to your father, Virginia, but were you not blind, or indifferent, you would long since have seen that your welfare means more to me than my loyalty to him-- more to me than my life or my honor.

　　"You asked where the creature came from that attacked you today.  I shall tell you.  It is one of a dozen similarly hideous things that your father has created in his mad desire to solve the problem of life. He has solved it; but, God, at what a price in misshapen, soulless, hideous monsters!"

　　The girl looked up at him, horror stricken.

　　"Do you mean to say that my father in a mad attempt to usurp the functions of God created that awful thing?" she asked in a low, faint voice, "and that there are others like it upon the island?"

　　"In the campong next to yours there are a dozen others," replied von Horn, "nor would it be easy to say which is the most hideous and repulsive.  They are grotesque caricatures of humanity--without soul and almost without brain."

　　"God!" murmured the girl, burying her face in her hands, "he has gone mad; he has gone mad."

　　"I truly believe that he is mad," said von Horn, "nor could you doubt it for a moment were I to tell you the worst."

　　"The worst!" exclaimed the girl.  "What could be worse than that which you already have divulged?  Oh, how could you have permitted it?"

　　"There is much worse than I have told you, Virginia. So much worse that I can scarce force my lips to frame the words, but you must be told.  I would be more criminally liable than your father were I to keep it from you, for my brain, at least, is not crazed. Virginia, you have in your mind a picture of the hideous thing that carried you off into the jungle?"

　　"Yes," and as the girl replied a convulsive shudder racked her frame.

　　Von Horn grasped her arm gently as he went on, as though to support and protect her during the shock that he was about to administer.

　　"Virginia," he said in a very low voice, "it is your father's intention to wed you to one of his creatures."

　　The girl broke from him with an angry cry.

　　"It is not true!" she exclaimed.  "It is not true. Oh, Dr. von Horn how could you tell me such a cruel and terrible untruth."

　　"As God is my judge, Virginia," and the man reverently uncovered as he spoke, "it is the truth.  Your father told me it in so many words when I asked his permission to pay court to you myself--you are to marry Number Thirteen when his education is complete."

　　"I shall die first!" she cried.

　　"Why not accept me instead?" suggested the man.

　　For a moment Virginia looked straight into his eyes as though to read his inmost soul.

　　"Let me have time to consider it, Doctor," she replied. "I do not know that I care for you in that way at all."

　　"Think of Number Thirteen," he suggested.  "It should not be difficult to decide."

　　"I could not marry you simply to escape a worse fate," replied the girl.  "I am not that cowardly--but let me think it over.  There can be no immediate danger, I am sure."

　　"One can never tell," replied von Horn, "what strange, new vagaries may enter a crazed mind to dictate this moment's action or the next."

　　"Where could we wed?" asked Virginia.

　　"The Ithaca would bear us to Singapore, and when we returned you would be under my legal protection and safe."

　　"I shall think about it from every angle," she answered sadly, "and now good night, my dear friend," and with a wan smile she entered her quarters.

　　For the next month Professor Maxon was busy educating Number Thirteen.  He found the young man intelligent far beyond his most sanguine hopes, so that the progress made was little short of uncanny.

　　Von Horn during this time continued to urge upon Virginia the necessity for a prompt and favorable decision in the matter of his proposal; but when it came time to face the issue squarely the girl found it impossible to accede to his request--she thought that she loved him, but somehow she dared not say the word that would make her his for life.

　　Bududreen, the Malay mate was equally harassed by conflicting desires, though of a different nature,  or he had his eye upon the main chance that was represented to him by the great chest, and also upon the lesser reward which awaited him upon delivery of the girl to Rajah Muda Saffir.  The fact that he could find no safe means for accomplishing both these ends simultaneously was all that had protected either from his machinations.

　　The presence of the uncanny creatures of the court of mystery had become known to the Malay and he used this knowledge as an argument to foment discord and mutiny in the ignorant and superstitious crew under his command.  By boring a hole in the partition wall separating their campong from the inner one he had disclosed to the horrified view of his men the fearsome brutes harbored so close to them.  The mate, of course, had no suspicion of the true origin of these monsters, but his knowledge of the fact that they had not been upon the island when the Ithaca arrived and that it would have been impossible for them to have landed and reached the camp without having been seen by himself or some member of his company, was sufficient evidence to warrant him in attributing their presence to some supernatural and malignant power.

　　This explanation the crew embraced willingly, and with it Bududreen's suggestion that Professor Maxon had power to transform them all into similar atrocities. The ball once started gained size and momentum as it progressed.  The professor's ofttimes strange expression was attributed to an evil eye, and every ailment suffered by any member of the crew was blamed upon their employer's Satanic influence.  There was but one escape from the horrors of such a curse--the death of its author; and when Bududreen discovered that they had reached this point, and were even discussing the method of procedure, he added all that was needed to the dangerously smouldering embers of bloody mutiny by explaining that should anything happen to the white men he would become sole owner of their belongings, including the heavy chest, and that the reward of each member of the crew would be generous.

　　Von Horn was really the only stumbling block in Bududreen's path.  With the natural cowardice of the Malay he feared this masterful American who never moved without a brace of guns slung about his hips; and it was at just this psychological moment that the doctor played into the hands of his subordinate, much to the latter's inward elation.

　　Von Horn had finally despaired of winning Virginia by peaceful court, and had about decided to resort to force when he was precipitately confirmed in his decision by a conversation with the girl's father.

　　He and the professor were talking in the workshop of the remarkable progress of Number Thirteen toward a complete mastery of English and the ways and manners of society, in which von Horn had been assisting his employer to train the young giant.  The breach between the latter and von Horn had been patched over by Professor Maxon's explanations to Number Thirteen as soon as the young man was able to comprehend--in the meantime it had been necessary to keep von Horn out of the workshop except when the giant was confined in his own room off the larger one.

　　Von Horn had been particularly anxious, for the furtherance of certain plans he had in mind, to effect a reconciliation with Number Thirteen, to reach a basis of friendship with the young man, and had left no stone unturned to accomplish this result.  To this end he had spent considerable time with Number Thirteen, coaching him in English and in the ethics of human association.

　　"He is progressing splendidly, Doctor," Professor Maxon had said.  "It will be but a matter of a day or so when I can introduce him to Virginia, but we must be careful that she has no inkling of his origin until mutual affection has gained a sure foothold between them."

　　"And if that should not occur?" questioned von Horn.

　　"I should prefer that they mated voluntarily," replied the professor, the strange gleam leaping to his eyes at the suggestion of possible antagonism to his cherished plan, "but if not, then they shall be compelled by the force of my authority--they both belong to me, body and soul."

　　"You will wait for the final consummation of your desires until you return with them to civilization, I presume," said von Horn.

　　"And why?" returned the professor.  "I can wed them here myself--it would be the surer way--yes, that is what I shall do."

　　It was this determination on the part of Professor Maxon that decided von Horn to act at once.  Further, it lent a reasonable justification for his purposed act.

　　Shortly after their talk the older man left the workshop, and von Horn took the opportunity to inaugurate the second move of his campaign.  Number Thirteen was sitting near a window which let upon the inner court, busy with the rudiments of written English.  Von Horn approached him.

　　"You are getting along nicely, Jack," he said kindly, looking over the other's shoulder and using the name which had been adopted at his suggestion to lend a more human tone to their relations with the nameless man.

　　"Yes," replied the other, looking up with a smile. "Professor Maxon says that in another day or two I may come and live in his own house, and again meet his beautiful daughter.  It seems almost too good to be true that I shall actually live under the same roof with her and see her every day--sit at the same table with her--and walk with her among the beautiful trees and flowers that witnessed our first meeting.  I wonder if she will remember me.  I wonder if she will be as glad to see me again as I shall be to see her."

　　"Jack," said von Horn, sadly, "I am afraid there is a terrible and disappointing awakening for you. It grieves me that it should be so, but it seems only fair to tell you, what Professor Maxon either does not know or has forgotten, that his daughter will not look with pleasure upon you when she learns your origin.

　　"You are not as other men.  You are but the accident of a laboratory experiment.  You have no soul, and the soul is all that raises man above the beasts.  Jack, poor boy, you are not a human being--you are not even a beast.  The world, and Miss Maxon is of the world, will look upon you as a terrible creature to be shunned-- a horrible monstrosity far lower in the scale of creation than the lowest order of brutes.

　　"Look," and the man pointed through the window toward the group of hideous things that wandered aimlessly about the court of mystery.  "You are of the same breed as those, you differ from them only in the symmetry of your face and features, and the superior development of your brain.  There is no place in the world for them, nor for you.

　　"I am sorry that it is so.  I am sorry that I should have to be the one to tell you; but it is better that you know it now from a friend than that you meet the bitter truth when you least expected it, and possibly from the lips of one like Miss Maxon for whom you might have formed a hopeless affection."

　　As von Horn spoke the expression on the young man's face became more and more hopeless, and when he had ceased he dropped his head into his open palms, sitting quiet and motionless as a carven statue.  No sob shook his great frame, there was no outward indication of the terrible grief that racked him inwardly--only in the pose was utter dejection and hopelessness.

　　The older man could not repress a cold smile--it had had more effect than he had hoped.

　　"Don't take it too hard, my boy," he continued. "The world is wide.  It would be easy to find a thousand places where your antecedents would be neither known nor questioned.  You might be very happy elsewhere and there a hundred thousand girls as beautiful and sweet as Virginia Maxon--remember that you have never seen another, so you can scarcely judge."

　　"Why did he ever bring me into the world?" exclaimed the young man suddenly.  "It was wicked--wicked-- terribly cruel and wicked."

　　"I agree with you," said von Horn quickly, seeing another possibility that would make his future plans immeasurably easier.  "It was wicked, and it is still more wicked to continue the work and bring still other unfortunate creatures into the world to be the butt and plaything of cruel fate."

　　"He intends to do that?" asked the youth.

　　"Unless he is stopped," replied von Horn.

　　"He must be stopped," cried the other.  "Even if it were necessary to kill him."

　　Von Horn was quite satisfied with the turn events had taken. He shrugged his shoulders and turned on his heel toward the outer campong.

　　"If he had wronged me as he has you, and those others," with a gesture toward the court of mystery, "I should not be long in reaching a decision."  And with that he passed out, leaving the door unlatched.

　　Von Horn went straight to the south campong and sought out Bududreen.  Motioning the Malay to follow him they walked across the clearing and entered the jungle out of sight and hearing of the camp.  Sing, hanging clothes in the north end of the clearing saw them depart, and wondered a little.

　　"Bududreen," said von Horn, when the two had reached a safe distance from the enclosures, "there is no need of mincing matters--something must be done at once.  I do not know how much you know of the work that Professor Maxon has been engaged in since we reached this island; but it has been hellish enough and it must go no further.  You have seen the creatures in the campong next to yours?"

　　"I have seen," replied Bududreen, with a shudder.

　　"Professor Maxon intends to wed one of these to his daughter," von Horn continued.  "She loves me and we wish to escape--can I rely on you and your men to aid us?  There is a chest in the workshop which we must take along too, and I can assure you that you all will be well rewarded for your work.  We intend merely to leave Professor Maxon here with the creatures he has created."

　　Bududreen could scarce repress a smile--it was indeed too splendid to be true.

　　"It will be perilous work, Captain," he answered. "We should all be hanged were we caught."

　　"There will be no danger of that, Bududreen, for there will be no one to divulge our secret."

　　"There will be the Professor Maxon," urged the Malay. "Some day he will escape from the island, and then we shall all hang."

　　"He will never escape," replied von Horn, "his own creatures will see to that.  They are already commencing to realize the horrible crime he has committed against them, and when once they are fully aroused there will be no safety for any of us.  If you wish to leave the island at all it will be best for you to accept my proposal and leave while your head yet remains upon your shoulders.  Were we to suggest to the professor that he leave now he would not only refuse but he would take steps to make it impossible for any of us to leave, even to sinking the Ithaca.  The man is mad--quite mad--Bududreen, and we cannot longer jeopardize our own throats merely to humor his crazy and criminal whims."

　　The Malay was thinking fast, and could von Horn have guessed what thoughts raced through the tortuous channels of that semi-barbarous brain he would have wished himself safely housed in the American prison where he belonged.

　　"When do you wish to sail?" asked the Malay.

　　"Tonight," replied von Horn, and together they matured their plans.  An hour later the second mate with six men disappeared into the jungle toward the harbor. They, with the three on watch, were to get the vessel in readiness for immediate departure.

　　After the evening meal von Horn sat on the verandah with Virginia Maxon until the Professor came from the workshop to retire for the night.  As he passed them he stopped for a word with von Horn, taking him aside out of the girl's hearing.

　　"Have you noticed anything peculiar in the actions of Thirteen?" asked the older man.  "He was sullen and morose this evening, and at times there was a strange, wild light in his eyes as he looked at me.  Can it be possible that, after all, his brain is defective? It would be terrible.  My work would have gone for naught, for I can see no way in which I can improve upon him."

　　"I will go and have a talk with him later," said von Horn, "so if you hear us moving about in the workshop, or even out here in the campong think nothing of it. I may take him for a long walk.  It is possible that the hard study and close confinement to that little building have been too severe upon his brain and nerves. A long walk each evening may bring him around all right."

　　"Splendid--splendid," replied the professor.  "You may be quite right.  Do it by all means, my dear doctor," and there was a touch of the old, friendly, sane tone which had been so long missing, that almost caused von Horn to feel a trace of compunction for the hideous act of disloyalty that he was on the verge of perpetrating.

　　As Professor Maxon entered the house von Horn returned to Virginia and suggested that they take a short walk outside the campong before retiring.  The girl readily acquiesced to the plan, and a moment later found them strolling through the clearing toward the southern end of the camp.  In the dark shadows of the gateway leading to the men's enclosure a figure crouched. The girl did not see it, but as they came opposite it von Horn coughed twice, and then the two passed on toward the edge of the jungle.

　　6

　　TO KILL!

　　The Rajah Muda Saffir, tiring of the excuses and delays which Bududreen interposed to postpone the fulfillment of his agreement with the former, whereby he was to deliver into the hands of the rajah a certain beautiful maiden, decided at last to act upon his own initiative. The truth of the matter was that he had come to suspect the motives of the first mate of the Ithaca, and not knowing of the great chest attributed them to Bududreen's desire to possess the girl for himself.

　　So it was that as the second mate of the Ithaca with his six men waded down the bed of the little stream toward the harbor and the ship, a fleet of ten war prahus manned by over five hundred fierce Dyaks and commanded by Muda Saffir himself, pulled cautiously into the little cove upon the opposite side of the island, and landed but a quarter of a mile from camp.

　　At the same moment von Horn was leading Virginia Maxon farther and farther from the north campong where resistance, if there was to be any, would be most likely to occur. At his superior's cough Bududreen had signalled silently to the men within the enclosure, and a moment later six savage lascars crept stealthily to his side.

　　The moment that von Horn and the girl were entirely concealed by the darkness, the seven moved cautiously along the shadow of the palisade toward the north campong.  There was murder in the cowardly hearts of several of them, and stupidity and lust in the hearts of all.  There was no single one who would not betray his best friend for a handful of silver, nor any but was inwardly hoping and scheming to the end that he might alone possess both the chest and the girl.

　　It was such a pack of scoundrels that Bududreen led toward the north campong to bear away the treasure. In the breast of the leader was the hope that he had planted enough of superstitious terror in their hearts to make the sight of the supposed author of their imagined wrongs sufficient provocation for his murder; for Bududreen was too sly to give the order for the killing of a white man--the arm of the white man's law was too long--but he felt that he would rest easier were he to leave the island with the knowledge that only a dead man remained behind with the secret of his perfidy.

　　While these events were transpiring Number Thirteen was pacing restlessly back and forth the length of the workshop.  But a short time before he had had his author--the author of his misery--within the four walls of his prison, and yet he had not wreaked the vengeance that was in his heart.  Twice he had been on the point of springing upon the man, but both times the other's eyes had met his and something which he was not able to comprehend had stayed him.  Now that the other had gone and he was alone contemplation of the hideous wrong that had been done loosed again the flood gates of his pent rage.

　　The thought that he had been made by this man--made in the semblance of a human being, yet denied by the manner of his creation a place among the lowest of Nature's creatures--filled him with fury, but it was not this thought that drove him to the verge of madness.  It was the knowledge, suggested by von Horn, that Virginia Maxon would look upon him in horror, as a grotesque and loathsome monstrosity.

　　He had no standard and no experience whereby he might classify his sentiments toward this wonderful creature. All he knew was that his life would be complete could he be near her always--see her and speak with her daily.  He had thought of her almost constantly since those short, delicious moments that he had held her in his arms.  Again and again he experienced in retrospection the exquisite thrill that had run through every fiber of his being at the sight of her averted eyes and flushed face.  And the more he let his mind dwell upon the wonderful happiness that was denied him because of his origin, the greater became his wrath against his creator.

　　It was now quite dark without.  The door leading to Professor Maxon's campong, left unlatched earlier in the evening by von Horn for sinister motives of his own, was still unbarred through a fatal coincidence of forgetfulness on the part of the professor.

　　Number Thirteen approached this door.  He laid his hand upon the knob.  A moment later he was moving noiselessly across the campong toward the house in which Professor Maxon lay peacefully sleeping; while at the south gate Bududreen and his six cutthroats crept cautiously within and slunk in the dense shadows of the palisade toward the workshop where lay the heavy chest of their desire.  At the same instant Muda Saffir with fifty of his head-hunting Dyaks emerged from the jungle east of the camp, bent on discovering the whereabouts of the girl the Malay sought and bearing her away to his savage court far within the jungle fastness of his Bornean principality.

　　Number Thirteen reached the verandah of the house and peered through the window into the living room, where an oil lamp, turned low, dimly lighted the interior, which he saw was unoccupied.  Going to the door he pushed it open and entered the apartment.  All was still within.  He listened intently for some slight sound which might lead him to the victim he sought, or warn him from the apartment of the girl or that of von Horn--his business was with Professor Maxon.  He did not wish to disturb the others whom he believed to be sleeping somewhere within the structure--a low, rambling bungalow of eight rooms.

　　Cautiously he approached one of the four doors which opened from the living room.  Gently he turned the knob and pushed the door ajar.  The interior of the apartment beyond was in inky darkness, but Number Thirteen's greatest fear was that he might have stumbled upon the sleeping room of Virginia Maxon, and that if she were to discover him there, not only would she be frightened, but her cries would alarm the other inmates of the dwelling.

　　The thought of the horror that his presence would arouse within her, the knowledge that she would look upon him as a terrifying monstrosity, added new fuel to the fires of hate that raged in his bosom against the man who had created him.  With clenched fists, and tight set jaws the great, soulless giant moved across the dark chamber with the stealthy noiselessness of a tiger. Feeling before him with hands and feet he made the circuit of the room before he reached the bed.

　　Scarce breathing he leaned over and groped across the covers with his fingers in search of his prey--the bed was empty.  With the discovery came a sudden nervous reaction that sent him into a cold sweat.  Weakly, he seated himself upon the edge of the bed. Had his fingers found the throat of Professor Maxon beneath the coverlet they would never have released their hold until life had forever left the body of the scientist, but now that the highest tide of the young man's hatred had come and gone he found himself for the first time assailed by doubts.

　　Suddenly he recalled the fact that the man whose life he sought was the father of the beautiful creature he adored. Perhaps she loved him and would be unhappy were he taken away from her.  Number Thirteen did not know, of course, but the idea obtruded itself, and had sufficient weight to cause him to remain seated upon the edge of the bed meditating upon the act he contemplated. He had by no means given up the idea of killing Professor Maxon, but now there were doubts and obstacles which had not been manifest before.

　　His standards of right and wrong were but half formed, from the brief attempts of Professor Maxon and von Horn to inculcate proper moral perceptions in a mind entirely devoid of hereditary inclinations toward either good or bad, but he realized one thing most perfectly--that to be a soulless thing was to be damned in the estimation of Virginia Maxon, and it now occurred to him that to kill her father would be the act of a soulless being. It was this thought more than another that caused him to pause in the pursuit of his revenge, since he knew that the act he contemplated would brand him the very thing he was, yet wished not to be.

　　At length, however, he slowly comprehended that no act of his would change the hideous fact of his origin; that nothing would make him acceptable in her eyes, and with a shake of his head he arose and stepped toward the living room to continue his search for the professor.

　　In the workshop Bududreen and his men had easily located the chest.  Dragging it into the north campong the Malay was about to congratulate himself upon the ease with which the theft had been accomplished when one of his fellows declared his intention of going to the house for the purpose of dispatching Professor Maxon, lest the influence of his evil eye should overtake them with some terrible curse when the loss of the chest should be discovered.

　　While this met fully with Bududreen's plans he urged the man against any such act that he might have witnesses to prove that he not only had no hand in the crime, but had exerted his authority to prevent it; but when two of the men separated themselves from the party and crept toward the bungalow no force was interposed to stop them.

　　The moon had risen now, so that from the dark shadows of the palisade Muda Saffir and his savages watched the party with Bududreen squatting about the heavy chest, and saw the two who crept toward the house.  To Muda Saffir's evil mind there was but one explanation. Bududreen had discovered a rich treasure, and having stolen that had dispatched two of his men to bring him the girl also.

　　Rajah Muda Saffir was furious.  In subdued whispers he sent a half dozen of his Dyaks back beneath the shadow of the palisade to the opposite side of the bungalow where they were to enter the building, killing all within except the girl, whom they were to carry straight to the beach and the war prahus.

　　Then with the balance of his horde he crept alone in the darkness until opposite Bududreen and the watchers about the chest.  Just as the two who crept toward the bungalow reached it, Muda Saffir gave the word for the attack upon the Malays and lascars who guarded the treasure.  With savage yells they dashed upon the unsuspecting men.  Parangs and spears glistened in the moonlight.  There was a brief and bloody encounter, for the cowardly Bududreen and his equally cowardly crew had had no alternative but to fight, so suddenly had the foe fallen upon them.

　　In a moment the savage Borneo head hunters had added five grisly trophies to their record.  Bududreen and another were racing madly toward the jungle beyond the campong.

　　As Number Thirteen arose to continue his search for Professor Maxon his quick ear caught the shuffling of bare feet upon the verandah.  As he paused to listen there broke suddenly upon the still night the hideous war cries of the Dyaks, and the screams and shrieks of their frightened victims in the campong without. Almost simultaneously Professor Maxon and Sing rushed into the living room to ascertain the cause of the wild alarm, while at the same instant Bududreen's assassins sprang through the door with upraised krisses, to be almost immediately followed by Muda Saffir's six Dyaks brandishing their long spears and wicked parangs.

　　In an instant the little room was filled with howling, fighting men.  The Dyaks, whose orders as well as inclinations incited them to a general massacre, fell first upon Bududreen's lascars who, cornered in the small room, fought like demons for their lives, so that when the Dyaks had overcome them two of their own number lay dead beside the dead bodies of Bududreen's henchmen.

　　Sing and Professor Maxon stood in the doorway to the professor's room gazing upon the scene of carnage in surprise and consternation.  The scientist was unarmed, but Sing held a long, wicked looking Colt in readiness for any contingency.  It was evident the celestial was no stranger to the use of his deadly weapon, nor to the moments of extreme and sudden peril which demanded its use, for he seemed no more perturbed than had he been but hanging out his weekly wash.

　　As Number Thirteen watched the two men from the dark shadows of the room in which he stood, he saw that both were calm--the Chinaman with the calmness of perfect courage, the other through lack of full understanding of the grave danger which menaced him.  In the eyes of the latter shone a strange gleam--it was the wild light of insanity that the sudden nervous shock of the attack had brought to a premature culmination.

　　Now the four remaining Dyaks were advancing upon the two men.  Sing levelled his revolver and fired at the foremost, and at the same instant Professor Maxon, with a shrill, maniacal scream, launched himself full upon a second.  Number Thirteen saw the blood spurt from a superficial wound in the shoulder of the fellow who received Sing's bullet, but except for eliciting a howl of rage the missile had no immediate effect.  Then Sing pulled the trigger again and again, but the cylinder would not revolve and the hammer fell futilely upon the empty cartridge.  As two of the head hunters closed upon him the brave Chinaman clubbed his weapon and went down beneath them beating madly at the brown skulls.

　　The man with whom Professor Maxon had grappled had no opportunity to use his weapons for the crazed man held him close with one encircling arm while he tore and struck at him with his free hand.  The fourth Dyak danced around the two with raised parang watching for an opening that he might deliver a silencing blow upon the white man's skull.

　　The great odds against the two men--their bravery in the face of death, their grave danger--and last and greatest, the fact that one was the father of the beautiful creature he worshipped, wrought a sudden change in Number Thirteen.  In an instant he forgot that he had come here to kill the white-haired man, and with a bound stood in the center of the room-- an unarmed giant towering above the battling four.

　　The parang of the Dyak who sought Professor Maxon's life was already falling as a mighty hand grasped the wrist of the head hunter; but even then it was too late to more than lessen the weight of the blow, and the sharp edge of the blade bit deep into the forehead of the white man.  As he sank to his knees his other antagonist freed an arm from the embrace which had pinioned it to his side, but before he could deal the professor a blow with the short knife that up to now he had been unable to use, Number Thirteen had hurled his man across the room and was upon him who menaced the scientist.

　　Tearing him loose from his prey, he raised him far above his head and threw him heavily against the opposite wall, then he turned his attention toward Sing's assailants.  All that had so far saved the Chinaman from death was the fact that the two savages were each so anxious to secure his head for the verandah rafters of his own particular long-house that they interfered with one another in the consummation of their common desire.

　　Although battling for his life, Sing had not failed to note the advent of the strange young giant, nor the part he had played in succoring the professor, so that it was with a feeling of relief that he saw the newcomer turn his attention toward those who were rapidly reducing the citadel of his own existence.

　　The two Dyaks who sought the trophy which nature had set upon the Chinaman's shoulders were so busily engaged with their victim that they knew nothing of the presence of Number Thirteen until a mighty hand seized each by the neck and they were raised bodily from the floor, shaken viciously for an instant, and then hurled to the opposite end of the room upon the bodies of the two who had preceded them.

　　As Sing came to his feet he found Professor Maxon lying in a pool of his own blood, a great gash in his forehead. He saw the white giant standing silently looking down upon the old man.  Across the room the four stunned Dyaks were recovering consciousness.  Slowly and fearfully they regained their feet, and seeing that no attention was being paid them, cast a parting, terrified look at the mighty creature who had defeated them with his bare hands, and slunk quickly out into the darkness of the campong.

　　When they caught up with Rajah Muda Saffir near the beach, they narrated a fearful tale of fifty terrible white men with whom they had battled valiantly, killing many, before they had been compelled to retreat in the face of terrific odds. They swore that even then they had only returned because the girl was not in the house--otherwise they should have brought her to their beloved master as he had directed.

　　Now Muda Saffir believed nothing that they said, but he was well pleased with the great treasure which had so unexpectedly fallen into his hands, and he decided to make quite sure of that by transporting it to his own land-- later he could return for the girl.  So the ten war prahus of the Malay pulled quietly out of the little cove upon the east side of the island, and bending their way toward the south circled its southern extremity and bore away for Borneo.

　　In the bungalow within the north campong Sing and Number Thirteen had lifted Professor Maxon to his bed, and the Chinaman was engaged in bathing and bandaging the wound that had left the older man unconscious. The white giant stood beside him watching his every move. He was trying to understand why sometimes men killed one another and again defended and nursed.  He was curious as to the cause of his own sudden change in sentiment toward Professor Maxon.  At last he gave the problem up as beyond his powers of solution, and at Sing's command set about the task of helping to nurse the man whom he considered the author of his unhappiness and whom a few short minutes before he had come to kill.

　　As the two worked over the stricken man their ears were suddenly assailed by a wild commotion from the direction of the workshop.  There were sounds of battering upon wood, loud growls and roars, mingled with weird shrieks and screams and the strange, uncanny gibbering of brainless things.

　　Sing looked quickly up at his companion.

　　"Whallee mallee?" he asked.

　　The giant did not answer.  An expression of pain crossed his features, and he shuddered--but not from fear.

　　7

　　THE BULL WHIP

　　As von Horn and Virginia Maxon walked slowly beneath the dense shadows of the jungle he again renewed his suit. It would please him more to have the girl accompany him voluntarily than to be compelled to take her by force, but take her he would one way or another, and that, this very night, for all the plans were made and already under way.

　　"I cannot do it, Doctor von Horn," she had said. "No matter how much danger I may be in here I cannot desert my father on this lonely isle with only savage lascars and the terrible monsters of his own creation surrounding him.  Why, it would be little short of murder for us to do such a thing.  I cannot see how you, his most trusted lieutenant, can even give an instant's consideration to the idea.

　　"And now that you insist that his mind is sorely affected, it is only an added reason why I must remain with him to protect him so far as I am able, from himself and his enemies."

　　Von Horn did not relish the insinuation in the accent which the girl put upon the last word.

　　"It is because I love you so, Virginia," he hastened to urge in extenuation of his suggested disloyalty. "I cannot see you sacrificed to his horrible mania. You do not realize the imminence of your peril. Tomorrow Number Thirteen was to have come to live beneath the same roof with you.  You recall Number One whom the stranger killed as the thing was bearing you away through the jungle?  Can you imagine sleeping in the same house with such a soulless thing?  Eating your three meals a day at the same table with it?  And knowing all the time that in a few short weeks at the most you were destined to be given to the thing as its mate?  Virginia, you must be mad to consider for a moment remaining within reach of such a terrible peril.

　　"Come to Singapore with me--it will take but a few days--and then we can return with some good medical man and a couple of Europeans, and take your father away from the terrible creatures he has created.  You will be mine then and safe from the awful fate that now lies back there in the camp awaiting you.  We can take your father upon a long trip where rest and quiet can have an opportunity to restore his enfeebled mentality. Come, Virginia!  Come with me now.  We can go directly to the Ithaca and safety.  Say that you will come."

　　The girl shook her head.

　　"I do not love you, I am afraid, Doctor von Horn, or I should certainly be moved by your appeal.  If you wish to bring help for my father I shall never cease to thank you if you will go to Singapore and fetch it, but it is not necessary that I go.  My place is here, near him."

　　In the darkness the girl did not see the change that came over the man's face, but his next words revealed his altered attitude with sufficient exactitude to thoroughly arouse her fears.

　　"Virginia," he said, "I love you, and I intend to have you. Nothing on earth can prevent me.  When you know me better you will return my love, but now I must risk offending you that I may save you for myself from the monstrous connection which your father contemplates for you.  If you will not come away from the island with me voluntarily I consider it my duty to take you away by force."

　　"You would never do that, Doctor von Horn!" she exclaimed.

　　Von Horn had gone too far.  He cursed himself inwardly for a fool.  Why the devil didn't that villain, Bududreen, come!  He should have been along to act his part half an hour before.

　　"No, Virginia," said the man, softly, after a moment's silence, "I could not do that; though my judgment tells me that I should do it.  You shall remain here if you insist and I will be with you to serve and protect both you and your father."

　　The words were fair, but the girl could not forget the ugly tone that had tinged his preceding statement. She felt that she would be glad when she found herself safely within the bungalow once more.

　　"Come," she said, "it is late.  Let us return to camp."

　　Von Horn was about to reply when the war cries of Muda Saffir's Dyaks as they rushed out upon Bududreen and his companions came to them distinctly through the tropic night.

　　"What was that?" cried the girl in an alarmed tone.

　　"God knows," replied von Horn.  "Can it be that our men have mutinied?"

　　He thought the six with Bududreen were carrying out their part in a most realistic manner, and a grim smile tinged his hard face.

　　Virginia Maxon turned resolutely toward the camp.

　　"I must go back there to my father," she said, "and so must you.  Our place is there--God give that we be not too late," and before von Horn could stop her she turned and ran through the darkness of the jungle in the direction of the camp.

　　Von Horn dashed after her, but so black was the night beneath the overhanging trees, festooned with their dark myriad creepers, that the girl was out of sight in an instant, and upon the soft carpet of the rotting vegetation her light footfalls gave no sound.

　　The doctor made straight for the camp, but Virginia, unused to jungle trailing even by day, veered sharply to the left.  The sounds which had guided her at first soon died out, the brush became thicker, and presently she realized that she had no conception of the direction of the camp.  Coming to a spot where the trees were less dense, and a little moonlight filtered to the ground, she paused to rest and attempt to regain her bearings.

　　As she stood listening for some sound which might indicate the whereabouts of the camp, she detected the noise of a body approaching through the underbrush. Whether man or beast she could but conjecture and so she stood with every nerve taut waiting the thing that floundered heavily toward her.  She hoped it might be von Horn, but the hideous war cries which had apprised her of enemies at the encampment made her fear that fate might be directing the footsteps of one of these upon her.

　　Nearer and nearer came the sound, and the girl stood poised ready to fly when the dark face of Bududreen suddenly emerged into the moonlight beside her. With an hysterical cry of relief the girl greeted him.

　　"Oh, Bududreen," she exclaimed, "what has happened at camp? Where is my father?  Is he safe?  Tell me."

　　The Malay could scarce believe the good fortune which had befallen him so quickly following the sore affliction of losing the treasure.  His evil mind worked quickly, so that he grasped the full possibilities that were his before the girl had finished her questioning.

　　"The camp was attacked by Dyaks, Miss Maxon," he replied. "Many of our men were killed, but your father escaped and has gone to the ship.  I have been searching for you and Doctor von Horn.  Where is he?"

　　"He was with me but a moment ago.  When we heard the cries at camp I hastened on to discover what calamity had befallen us--we became separated."

　　"He will be safe," said Bududreen, "for two of my men are waiting to guide you and the doctor to the ship in case you returned to camp before I found you.  Come, we will hasten on to the harbor.  Your father will be worried if we are long delayed, and he is anxious to make sail and escape before the Dyaks discover the location of the Ithaca."

　　The man's story seemed plausible enough to Virginia, although she could not repress a little pang of regret that her father had been willing to go on to the harbor before he knew her fate.  However, she explained that by her belief that his mind was unbalanced through constant application to his weird obsession.

　　Without demur, then, she turned and accompanied the rascally Malay toward the harbor.  At the bank of the little stream which led down to the Ithaca's berth the man lifted her to his shoulder and thus bore her the balance of the way to the beach.  Here two of his men were awaiting him in one of the ship's boats, and without words they embarked and pulled for the vessel.

　　Once on board Virginia started immediately for her father's cabin.  As she crossed the deck she noticed that the ship was ready to sail, and even as she descended the companionway she heard the rattle of the anchor chain about the capstan.  She wondered if von Horn could be on board too.  It seemed remarkable that all should have reached the Ithaca so quickly, and equally strange that none of her own people were on deck to welcome her, or to command the vessel.

　　To her chagrin she found her father's cabin empty, and a moment's hurried investigation disclosed the fact that von Horn's was unoccupied as well.  Now her doubts turned quickly to fears, and with a little gasp of dismay at the grim possibilities which surged through her imagination she ran quickly to the companionway, but above her she saw that the hatch was down, and when she reached the top that it was fastened.  Futilely she beat upon the heavy planks with her delicate hands, calling aloud to Bududreen to release her, but there was no reply, and with the realization of the hopelessness of her position she dropped back to the deck, and returned to her stateroom.  Here she locked and barricaded the door as best she could, and throwing herself upon the berth awaited in dry-eyed terror the next blow that fate held in store for her.

　　Shortly after von Horn became separated from Virginia he collided with the fleeing lascar who had escaped the parangs of Muda Saffir's head hunters at the same time as had Bududreen.  So terror stricken was the fellow that he had thrown away his weapons in the panic of flight, which was all that saved von Horn from death at the hands of the fear crazed man.  To him, in the extremity of his fright, every man was an enemy, and the doctor had a tough scuffle with him before he could impress upon the fellow that he was a friend.

　　From him von Horn obtained an incoherent account of the attack, together with the statement that he was the only person in camp that escaped, all the others having been cut down by the savage horde that overwhelmed them. It was with difficulty that von Horn persuaded the man to return with him to the campong, but finally, he consented to do so when the doctor with drawn revolver, presented death as the only alternative.

　　Together they cautiously crept back toward the palisade, not knowing at what moment they might come upon the savage enemy that had wrought such havoc among their forces, for von Horn believed the lascar's story that all had perished. His only motive for returning lay in his desire to prevent Virginia Maxon falling into the hands of the Dyaks, or, failing that, rescuing her from their clutches.

　　Whatever faults and vices were Carl von Horn's cowardice was not one of them, and it was without an instant's hesitation that he had elected to return to succor the girl he believed to have returned to camp, although he entertained no scruples regarding the further pursuit of his dishonorable intentions toward her, should he succeed in saving her from her other enemies.

　　As the two approached the campong quiet seemed to have again fallen about the scene of the recent alarm. Muda Saffir had passed on toward the cove with the heavy chest, and the scrimmage in the bungalow was over. But von Horn did not abate his watchfulness as he stole silently within the precincts of the north campong, and, hugging the denser shadows of the palisade, crept toward the house.

　　The dim light in the living room drew him to one of the windows which overlooked the verandah.  A glance within howed him Sing and Number Thirteen bending over the body of Professor Maxon.  He noted the handsome face and perfect figure of the young giant.  He saw the bodies of the dead lascars and Dyaks.  Then he saw Sing and the young man lift Professor Maxon tenderly in their arms and bear him to his own room.

　　A sudden wave of jealous rage swept through the man's vicious brain.  He saw that the soulless thing within was endowed with a kindlier and more noble nature than he himself possessed.  He had planted the seed of hatred and revenge within his untutored heart without avail, for he read in the dead bodies of Bududreen's men and the two Dyaks the story of Number Thirteen's defense of the man von Horn had hoped he would kill.

　　Von Horn was quite sure now that Virginia Maxon was not within the campong.  Either she had become confused and lost in the jungle after she left him, or had fallen into the hands of the wild horde that had attacked the camp.  Convinced of this, there was no obstacle to thwart the sudden plan which entered his malign brain. With a single act he could rid himself of the man whom he had come to look upon as a rival, whose physical beauty aroused his envy and jealousy; he could remove, in the person of Professor Maxon, the parental obstacle which might either prevent his obtaining the girl, or make serious trouble for him in case he took her by force, and at the same time he could transfer to the girl's possession the fortune which was now her father's--and he could accomplish it all without tainting his own hands with the blood of his victims.

　　As the full possibilities of his devilish scheme unfolded before his mind's eye a grim smile curled his straight, thin lips at the thought of the fate which it entailed for the creator of the hideous monsters of the court of mystery.

　　As he turned away from the bungalow his eye fell upon the trembling lascar who had accompanied him to the edge of the verandah.  He must be rid of the fellow in some way--no eye must see him perpetrate the deed he had in mind.  A solution quickly occurred to him.

　　"Hasten to the harbor," he said to the man in a low voice, "and tell those on board the ship that I shall join them presently.  Have all in readiness to sail. I wish to fetch some of my belongings--all within the bungalow are dead."

　　No command could have better suited the sailor. Without a word he turned and fled toward the jungle. Von Horn walked quickly to the workshop.  The door hung open.  Through the dark interior he strode straight to the opposite door which let upon the court of mystery. On a nail driven into the door frame hung a heavy bull whip. The doctor took it down as he raised the strong bar which held the door.  Then he stepped through into the moonlit inner campong--the bull whip in his right hand, a revolver in his left.

　　A half dozen misshapen monsters roved restlessly about the hard packed earth of the pen.  The noise of the battle in the adjoining enclosure had aroused them from slumber and awakened in their half formed brains vague questionings and fears.  At sight of von Horn several of them rushed for him with menacing growls, but a swift crack of the bull whip brought them to a sudden realization of the identity of the intruder, so that they slunk away, muttering and whining in rage.

　　Von Horn passed quickly to the low shed in which the remainder of the eleven were sleeping.  With vicious cuts from the stinging lash he lay about him upon the sleeping things.  Roaring and shrieking in pain and anger the creatures stumbled to their feet and lumbered awkwardly into the open.  Two of them turned upon their tormentor, but the burning weapon on their ill protected flesh sent them staggering back out of reach, and in another moment all were huddled in the center of the campong.

　　As cattle are driven, von Horn drove the miserable creatures toward the door of the workshop.  At the threshold of the dark interior the frightened things halted fearfully, and then as von Horn urged them on from behind with his cruel whip they milled as cattle at the entrance to a strange corral.

　　Again and again he urged them for the door, but each time they turned away, and to escape the whip beat and tore at the wall of the palisade in a vain effort to batter it from their pathway.  Their roars and shrieks were almost deafening as von Horn, losing what little remained of his scant self-control, dashed among them laying to right and left with the stern whip and the butt of his heavy revolver.

　　Most of the monsters scattered and turned back into the center of the enclosure, but three of them were forced through the doorway into the workshop, from the darkness of which they saw the patch of moonlight through the open door upon the opposite side.  Toward this they scurried as von Horn turned back into the court of mystery for the others.

　　Three more herculean efforts he made before he beat the last of the creatures through the outer doorway of the workshop into the north campong.

　　Among the age old arts of the celestials none is more strangely inspiring than that of medicine.  Odd herbs and unspeakable things when properly compounded under a favorable aspect of the heavenly bodies are potent to achieve miraculous cures, and few are the Chinamen who do not brew some special concoction of their own devising for the lesser ills which beset mankind.

　　Sing was no exception in this respect.  In various queerly shaped, bamboo covered jars he maintained a supply of tonics, balms and lotions.  His first thought when he had made Professor Maxon comfortable upon the couch was to fetch his pet nostrum, for there burned strong within his yellow breast the same powerful yearning to experiment that marks the greatest of the profession to whose mysteries he aspired.

　　Though the hideous noises from the inner campong rose threateningly, the imperturbable Sing left the bungalow and passed across the north campong to the little lean-to that he had built for himself against the palisade that separated the north enclosure from the court of mystery.

　　Here he rummaged about in the dark until he had found the two phials he sought.  The noise of the monsters upon the opposite side of the palisade had now assumed the dimensions of pandemonium, and through it all the Chinaman heard the constant crack that was the sharp voice of the bull whip.

　　He had completed his search and was about to return to the bungalow when the first of the monsters emerged into the north campong from the workshop.  At the door of his shack Sing Lee drew back to watch, for he knew that behind them some one was driving these horribly grotesque creatures from their prison.

　　One by one they came lumbering into the moonlight until Sing had counted eleven, and then, after them, came a white man, bull whip and revolver in hand.  It was von Horn.  The equatorial moon shone full upon him--there could be no mistake.  The Chinaman saw him turn and lock the workshop door; saw him cross the campong to the outer gate; saw him pass through toward the jungle, closing the gate.

　　Of a sudden there was a sad, low moaning through the surrounding trees; dense, black clouds obscured the radiant moon; and then with hideous thunder and vivid flashes of lightning the tempest broke in all its fury of lashing wind and hurtling deluge.  It was the first great storm of the breaking up of the monsoon, and under the cover of its darkness Sing Lee scurried through the monster filled campong to the bungalow. Within he found the young man bathing Professor Maxon's head as he had directed him to do.

　　"All gettee out," he said, jerking his thumb in the direction of the court of mystery.  "Eleven devils. Plenty soon come bung'low.  What do?"

　　Number Thirteen had seen von Horn's extra bull whip hanging upon a peg in the living room.  For answer he stepped into that room and took the weapon down. Then he returned to the professor's side.

　　Outside the frightened monsters groped through the blinding rain and darkness in search of shelter. Each vivid lightning flash, and bellowing of booming thunder brought responsive cries of rage and terror from their hideous lips.  It was Number Twelve who first spied the dim light showing through the bungalow's living room window.  With a low guttural to his companions he started toward the building.  Up the low steps to the verandah they crept.  Number Twelve peered through the window. He saw no one within, but there was warmth and dryness.

　　His little knowledge and lesser reasoning faculties suggested no thought of a doorway.  With a blow he shattered the glass of the window.  Then he forced his body through the narrow aperture.  At the same moment a gust of wind sucking through the broken panes drew open the door, and as Number Thirteen, warned by the sound of breaking glass, sprang into the living room he was confronted by the entire horde of misshapen beings.

　　His heart went out in pity toward the miserable crew, but he knew that his life as well as those of the two men in the adjoining room depended upon the force and skill with which he might handle the grave crisis which confronted them.  He had seen and talked with most of the creatures when from time to time they had been brought singly into the workshop that their creator might mitigate the wrong he had done by training the poor minds with which he had endowed them to reason intelligently.

　　A few were hopeless imbeciles, unable to comprehend more than the rudimentary requirements of filling their bellies when food was placed before them; yet even these were endowed with superhuman strength; and when aroused battled the more fiercely for the very reason of their brainlessness.  Others, like Number Twelve, were of a higher order of intelligence.  They spoke English, and, after a fashion, reasoned in a crude sort of way.  These were by far the most dangerous, for as the power of comparison is the fundamental principle of reasoning, so they were able to compare their lot with that of the few other men they had seen, and with the help of von Horn to partially appreciate the horrible wrong that had been done them.

　　Von Horn, too, had let them know the identity of their creator, and thus implanted in their malformed brains the insidious poison of revenge.  Envy and jealousy were there as well, and hatred of all beings other than themselves.  They envied the ease and comparative beauty of the old professor and his assistant, and hated the latter for the cruelty of the bull whip and the constant menace of the ever ready revolver; and so as they were to them the representatives of the great human world of which they could never be a part, their envy and jealousy and hatred of these men embraced the entire race which they represented.

　　It was such that Number Thirteen faced as he emerged from the professor's apartment.

　　"What do you want here?" he said, addressing Number Twelve, who stood a little in advance of the others.

　　"We have come for Maxon," growled the creature. "We have been penned up long enough.  We want to be out here.  We have come to kill Maxon and you and all who have made us what we are."

　　"Why do you wish to kill me?" asked the young man. "I am one of you.  I was made in the same way that you were made."

　　Number Twelve opened his mismated eyes in astonishment.

　　"Then you have already killed Maxon?" he asked.

　　"No.  He was wounded by a savage enemy.  I have been helping to make him well again.  He has wronged me as much as he has you.  If I do not wish to kill him, why should you?  He did not mean to wrong us.  He thought that he was doing right.  He is in trouble now and we should stay and protect him."

　　"He lies," suddenly shouted another of the horde. "He is not one of us.  Kill him!  Kill him!  Kill Maxon, too, and then we shall be as other men, for it is these men who keep us as we are."

　　The fellow started forward toward Number Thirteen as he spoke, and moved by the impulse of imitation the others came on with him.

　　"I have spoken fairly to you," said Number Thirteen in a low voice.  "If you cannot understand fairness here is something you can understand."

　　Raising the bull whip above his head the young giant leaped among the advancing brutes and lay about him with mighty strokes that put to shame the comparatively feeble blows with which von Horn had been wont to deal out punishment to the poor, damned creatures of the court of mystery.

　　For a moment they stood valiantly before his attack, but after two had grappled with him and been hurled headlong to the floor they gave up and rushed incontinently out into the maelstrom of the screaming tempest.

　　In the doorway behind him Sing Lee had been standing waiting the outcome of the encounter and ready to lend a hand were it required.  As the two men turned back into the professor's room they saw that the wounded man's eyes were open and upon them.  At sight of Number Thirteen a questioning look came into his eyes.

　　"What has happened?" he asked feebly of Sing.  "Where is my daughter?  Where is Dr. von Horn?  What is this creature doing out of his pen?"

　　The blow of the parang upon the professor's skull had shocked his overwrought mind back into the path of sanity.  It had left him with a clear remembrance of the past, other than the recent fight in the living room--that was a blank--and it had given him a clearer perspective of the plans he had been entertaining for so long relative to this soulless creature.

　　The first thought that sprang to his mind as he saw Number Thirteen before him was of his mad intention to give his daughter to such a monstrous thing.  With the recollection came a sudden loathing and hatred of this and the other creatures of his unholy experimentations.

　　Presently he realized that his questions had not been answered.

　　"Sing!" he shouted.  "Answer me.  Where are Virginia and Dr. von Horn?"

　　"All gonee.  Me no know.  All gonee.  Maybeso allee dead."

　　"My God!" groaned the stricken man; and then his eyes again falling upon the silent giant in the doorway, "Out of my sight," he shrieked.  "Out of my sight! Never let me see you again--and to think that I would have given my only daughter to a soulless thing like you.  Away!  Before I go mad and slay you."

　　Slowly the color mounted to the neck and face of the giant-- then suddenly it receded, leaving him as ashen as death. His great hand gripped the stock of the bull whip. A single blow was all that would have been needed to silence Professor Maxon forever.  There was murder in the wounded heart.  The man took a step forward into the room, and then something drew his eyes to a spot upon the wall just above Professor Maxon's shoulder-- it was a photograph of Virginia Maxon.

　　Without a word Number Thirteen turned upon his heel and passed out into the storm.

　　THE SOUL OF NUMBER 13

　　Scarcely had the Ithaca cleared the reef which lies almost across the mouth of the little harbor where she had been moored for so many months than the tempest broke upon her in all its terrific fury.  Bududreen was no mean sailor, but he was short handed, nor is it reasonable to suppose that even with a full crew he could have weathered the terrific gale which beat down upon the hapless vessel.  Buffeted by great waves, and stripped of every shred of canvas by the force of the mighty wind that howled about her, the Ithaca drifted a hopeless wreck soon after the storm struck her.

　　Below deck the terrified girl clung desperately to a stanchion as the stricken ship lunged sickeningly before the hurricane.  For half an hour the awful suspense endured, and then with a terrific crash the vessel struck, shivering and trembling from stem to stern.

　　Virginia Maxon sank to her knees in prayer, for this she thought must surely be the end.  On deck Bududreen and his crew had lashed themselves to the masts, and as the Ithaca struck the reef before the harbor, back upon which she had been driven, the tall poles with their living freight snapped at the deck and went overboard carrying every thing with them amid shrieks and cries of terror that were drowned and choked by the wild tumult of the night.

　　Twice the girl felt the ship strike upon the reef, then a great wave caught and carried her high into the air, dropping her with a nauseating lunge which seemed to the imprisoned girl to be carrying the ship to the very bottom of the ocean.  With closed eyes she clung in silent prayer beside her berth waiting for the moment that would bring the engulfing waters and oblivion-- praying that the end might come speedily and release her from the torture of nervous apprehension that had terrorized her for what seemed an eternity.

　　After the last, long dive the Ithaca righted herself laboriously, wallowing drunkenly, but apparently upon an even keel in less turbulent waters.  One long minute dragged after another, yet no suffocating deluge poured in upon the girl, and presently she realized that the ship had, at least temporarily, weathered the awful buffeting of the savage elements.  Now she felt but a gentle roll, though the wild turmoil of the storm still came to her ears through the heavy planking of the Ithaca's hull.

　　For a long hour she lay wondering what fate had overtaken the vessel and whither she had been driven, and then, with a gentle grinding sound, the ship stopped, swung around, and finally came to rest with a slight list to starboard.  The wind howled about her, the torrential rain beat loudly upon her, but except for a slight rocking the ship lay quiet.

　　Hours passed with no other sounds than those of the rapidly waning tempest.  The girl heard no signs of life upon the ship.  Her curiosity became more and more keenly aroused.  She had that indefinable, intuitive feeling that she was utterly alone upon the vessel, and at length, unable to endure the inaction and uncertainty longer, made her way to the companion ladder where for half an hour she futilely attempted to remove the hatch.

　　As she worked she failed to hear the scraping of naked bodies clambering over the ship's side, or the padding of unshod feet upon the deck above her.  She was about to give up her work at the hatch when the heavy wooden cover suddenly commenced to move above her as though actuated by some supernatural power.  Fascinated, the girl stood gazing in wide-eyed astonishment as one end of the hatch rose higher and higher until a little patch of blue sky revealed the fact that morning had come.  Then the cover slid suddenly back and Virginia Maxon found herself looking into a savage and terrible face.

　　The dark skin was creased in fierce wrinkles about the eyes and mouth.  Gleaming tiger cat's teeth curved upward from holes pierced to receive them in the upper half of each ear.  The slit ear lobes supported heavy rings whose weight had stretched the skin until the long loop rested upon the brown shoulders.  The filed and blackened teeth behind the loose lips added the last touch of hideousness to this terrible countenance.

　　Nor was this all.  A score of equally ferocious faces peered down from behind the foremost.  With a little scream Virginia Maxon sprang back to the lower deck and ran toward her stateroom.  Behind her she heard the commotion of many men descending the companionway.

　　As Number Thirteen came into the campong after quitting the bungalow his heart was a chaos of conflicting emotions.  His little world had been wiped out. His creator--the man whom he thought his only friend and benefactor--had suddenly turned against him. The beautiful creature he worshipped was either lost or dead; Sing had said so.  He was nothing but a miserable THING.  There was no place in the world for him, and even should he again find Virginia Maxon, he had von Horn's word for it that she would shrink from him and loathe him even more than another.

　　With no plans and no hopes he walked aimlessly through the blinding rain, oblivious of it and of the vivid lightning and deafening thunder.  The palisade at length brought him to a sudden stop.  Mechanically he squatted on his haunches with his back against it, and there, in the midst of the fury of the storm he conquered the tempest that raged in his own breast. The murder that rose again and again in his untaught heart he forced back by thoughts of the sweet, pure face of the girl whose image he had set up in the inner temple of his being, as a gentle, guiding divinity.

　　"He made me without a soul," he repeated over and over again to himself, "but I have found a soul--she shall be my soul.  Von Horn could not explain to me what a soul is.  He does not know.  None of them knows.  I am wiser than all the rest, for I have learned what a soul is. Eyes cannot see it--fingers cannot feel it, but he who possess it knows that it is there for it fills his whole breast with a great, wonderful love and worship for something infinitely finer than man's dull senses can gauge-- something that guides him into paths far above the plain of soulless beasts and bestial men.

　　"Let those who will say that I have no soul, for I am satisfied with the soul I have found.  It would never permit me to inflict on others the terrible wrong that Professor Maxon has inflicted on me--yet he never doubts his own possession of a soul.  It would not allow me to revel in the coarse brutalities of von Horn--and I am sure that von Horn thinks he has a soul. And if the savage men who came tonight to kill have souls, then I am glad that my soul is after my own choosing--I would not care for one like theirs."

　　The sudden equatorial dawn found the man still musing. The storm had ceased and as the daylight brought the surroundings to view Number Thirteen became aware that he was not alone in the campong.  All about him lay the eleven terrible men whom he had driven from the bungalow the previous night.  The sight of them brought a realization of new responsibilities.  To leave them here in the campong would mean the immediate death of Professor Maxon and the Chinaman.  To turn them into the jungle might mean a similar fate for Virginia Maxon were she wandering about in search of the encampment-- Number Thirteen could not believe that she was dead. It seemed too monstrous to believe that he should never see her again, and he knew so little of death that it was impossible for him to realize that that beautiful creature ever could cease to be filled with the vivacity of life.

　　The young man had determined to leave the camp himself-- partly on account of the cruel words Professor Maxon had hurled at him the night before, but principally in order that he might search for the lost girl. Of course he had not the remotest idea where to look for her, but as von Horn had explained that they were upon a small island he felt reasonably sure that he should find her in time.

　　As he looked at the sleeping monsters near him he determined that the only solution of his problem was to take them all with him.  Number Twelve lay closest to him, and stepping to his side he nudged him with the butt of the bull whip he still carried. The creature opened his dull eyes.

　　"Get up," said Number Thirteen.

　　Number Twelve rose, looking askance at the bull whip.

　　"We are not wanted here," said Number Thirteen. "I am going away and you are all going with me.  We shall find a place where we may live in peace and freedom. Are you not tired of always being penned up?"

　　"Yes," replied Number Twelve, still looking at the whip.

　　"You need not fear the whip," said the young man. "I shall not use it on those who make no trouble. Wake the others and tell them what I have said. All must come with me--those who refuse shall feel the whip."

　　Number Twelve did as he was bid.  The creatures mumbled among themselves for a few minutes.  Finally Number Thirteen cracked his long whip to attract their attention.

　　"Come!" he said.

　　Nine of them shuffled after him as he turned toward the outer gate--only Number Ten and Number Three held back. The young man walked quickly to where they stood eyeing him sullenly.  The others halted to watch--ready to spring upon their new master should the tide of the impending battle turn against him.  The two mutineers backed away snarling, their hideous features distorted in rage.

　　"Come!" repeated Number Thirteen.

　　"We will stay here," growled Number Ten.  "We have not yet finished with Maxon."

　　A loop in the butt of the bull whip was about the young man's wrist.  Dropping the weapon from his hand it still dangled by the loop.  At the same instant he launched himself at the throat of Number Ten, for he realized that a decisive victory now without the aid of the weapon they all feared would make the balance of his work easier.

　　The brute met the charge with lowered head and outstretched hands, and in another second they were locked in a clinch, tearing at one another like two great gorillas.  For a moment Number Three stood watching the battle, and then he too sprang in to aid his fellow mutineer.  Number Thirteen was striking heavy blows with his giant hands upon the face and head of his antagonist, while the long, uneven fangs of the latter had found his breast and neck a half dozen times. Blood covered them both.  Number Three threw his enormous weight into the conflict with the frenzy of a mad bull.

　　Again and again he got a hold upon the young giant's throat only to be shaken loose by the mighty muscles. The excitement of the conflict was telling upon the malformed minds of the spectators.  Presently one who was almost brainless, acting upon the impulse of suggestion, leaped in among the fighters, striking and biting at Number Thirteen. It was all that was needed--another second found the whole monstrous crew upon the single man.

　　His mighty strength availed him but little in the unequal conflict--eleven to one were too great odds even for those powerful thews.  His great advantage lay in his superior intelligence, but even this seemed futile in the face of the enormous weight of numbers that opposed him.  Time and again he had almost shaken himself free only to fall once more--dragged down by hairy arms about his legs.

　　Hither and thither about the campong the battle raged until the fighting mass rolled against the palisade, and here, at last, with his back to the structure, Number Thirteen regained his feet, and with the heavy stock of the bull whip beat off, for a moment, those nearest him.  All were winded, but when those who were left of the eleven original antagonists drew back to regain their breath, the young giant gave them no respite, but leaped among them with the long lash they had such good reason to hate and fear.

　　The result was as his higher intelligence had foreseen-- the creatures scattered to escape the fury of the lash and a moment later he had them at his mercy.  About the campong lay four who had felt the full force of his heavy fist, while not one but bore some mark of the battle.

　　Not a moment did he give them to recuperate after he had scattered them before he rounded them up once more near the outer gate--but now they were docile and submissive. In pairs he ordered them to lift their unconscious comrades to their shoulders and bear them into the jungle, for Number Thirteen was setting out into the world with his grim tribe in search of his lady love.

　　Once well within the jungle they halted to eat of the more familiar fruit which had always formed the greater bulk of their sustenance.  Thus refreshed, they set out once more after the leader who wandered aimlessly beneath the shade of the tall jungle trees amidst the gorgeous tropic blooms and gay, songless birds-- and of the twelve only the leader saw the beauties that surrounded them or felt the strange, mysterious influence of the untracked world they trod.  Chance took them toward the west until presently they emerged upon the harbor's edge, where from the matted jungle they overlooked for the first time the waters of the little bay and the broader expanse of strait beyond, until their eyes rested at last upon the blurred lines of distant Borneo.

　　From other vantage points at the jungle's border two other watchers looked out upon the scene.  One was the lascar whom von Horn had sent down to the Ithaca the night before but who had reached the harbor after she sailed.  The other was von Horn himself.  And both were looking out upon the dismantled wreck of the Ithaca where it lay in the sand near the harbor's southern edge.

　　Neither ventured forth from his place of concealment, for beyond the Ithaca ten prahus were pulling gracefully into the quiet waters of the basin.

　　Rajah Muda Saffir, caught by the hurricane the preceding night as he had been about to beat across to Borneo, had scurried for shelter within one of the many tiny coves which indent the island's entire coast. It happened that his haven of refuge was but a short distance south of the harbor in which he knew the Ithaca to be moored, and in the morning he decided to pay that vessel a visit in the hope that he might learn something of advantage about the girl from one of her lascar crew.

　　The wily Malay had long refrained from pillaging the Ithaca for fear such an act might militate against the larger villainy he purposed perpetrating against her white owner, but when he rounded the point and came in sight of the stranded wreck he put all such thoughts from him and made straight for the helpless hulk to glean whatever of salvage might yet remain within her battered hull.

　　The old rascal had little thought of the priceless treasure hidden beneath the Ithaca's clean swept deck as he ordered his savage henchmen up her sides while he lay back upon his sleeping mat beneath the canopy which protected his vice-regal head from the blistering tropic sun.

　　Number Thirteen watched the wild head hunters with keenest interest as they clambered aboard the vessel. With von Horn he saw the evident amazement which followed the opening of the hatch, though neither guessed its cause.  He saw the haste with which a half dozen of the warriors leaped down the companionway and heard their savage shouts as they pursued their quarry within the bowels of the ship.

　　A few minutes later they emerged dragging a woman with them.  Von Horn and Number Thirteen recognized the girl simultaneously, but the doctor, though he ground his teeth in futile rage, knew that he was helpless to avert the tragedy.  Number Thirteen neither knew nor cared.

　　"Come!" he called to his grotesque horde.  "Kill the men and save the girl--the one with the golden hair," he added as the sudden realization came to him that none of these creatures ever had seen a woman before. Then he dashed from the shelter of the jungle, across the beach and into the water, his fearful pack at his heels.

　　The Ithaca lay now in about five feet of water, and the war prahus of Muda Saffir rode upon her seaward side, so that those who manned them did not see the twelve who splashed through the water from land.  Never before had any of the rescuers seen a larger body of water than the little stream which wound through their campong, but accidents and experiments in that had taught them the danger of submerging their heads. They could not swim, but all were large and strong, so that they were able to push their way rapidly through the water to the very side of the ship.

　　Here they found difficulty in reaching the deck, but in a moment Number Thirteen had solved the problem by requiring one of the taller of his crew to stand close in by the ship while the others clambered upon his shoulders and from there to the Ithaca's deck.

　　Number Thirteen was the first to pull himself over the vessel's side, and as he did so he saw some half dozen Dyaks preparing to quit her upon the opposite side. They were the last of the boarding party--the girl was nowhere in sight.  Without waiting for his men the young giant sprang across the deck.  His one thought was to find Virginia Maxon.

　　At the sound of his approach the Dyak turned, and at the sight of a pajama clad white man armed only with a long whip they emitted savage cries of anticipation, counting the handsome trophy upon the white one's shoulders as already theirs.  Number Thirteen would have paid no attention whatever to them had they not molested him, for he wished only to reach the girl's side as quickly as possible; but in another moment he found himself confronted by a half dozen dancing wild men, brandishing wicked looking parangs, and crying tauntingly.

　　Up went the great bull whip, and without abating his speed a particle the man leaped into the midst of the wicked blades that menaced him.  Right and left with the quickness of thought the heavy lash fell upon heads, shoulders and sword arms.  There was no chance to wield a blade in the face of that terrific onslaught, for the whip fell, not with the ordinary force of a man-held lash, but with all the stupendous power of those giant shoulders and arms behind it.

　　A single blow felled the foremost head hunter, breaking his shoulder and biting into the flesh and bone as a heavy sword bites.  Again and again the merciless leather fell, while in the boats below Muda Saffir and his men shouted loud cries of encouragement to their companions on the ship, and a wide-eyed girl in the stern of Muda Saffir's own prahu looked on in terror, hope and admiration at the man of her own race whom she felt was battling against all these odds for her alone.

　　Virginia Maxon recognized her champion instantly as he who had fought for her and saved her once before, from the hideous creature of her father's experiments. With hands tight pressed against her bosom the girl leaned forward, tense with excitement, watching every move of the lithe, giant figure, as, silhouetted against the brazen tropic sky, it towered above the dancing, shrieking head hunters who writhed beneath the awful lash.

　　Muda Saffir saw that the battle was going against his men, and it filled him with anger.  Turning to one of his headmen he ordered two more boatloads of warriors to the Ithaca's deck. As they were rushing to obey their leader's command there was a respite in the fighting on the ship, for the three who had not fallen beneath the bull whip had leaped overboard to escape the fate which had overtaken their comrades.

　　As the reinforcements started to scale the vessel's side Number Thirteen's searching eyes found the girl in Muda Saffir's prahu, where it lay a little off from the Ithaca, and as the first of the enemy clambered over the rail she saw a smile of encouragement light the clear cut features of the man above her.  Virginia Maxon sent back an answering smile--a smile that filled the young giant's heart with pride and happiness-- such a smile as brave men have been content to fight and die for since woman first learned the art of smiling.

　　Number Thirteen could have beaten back many of the reinforcing party before they reached the deck, but he did not care to do so.  In the spontaneous ethics of the man there seemed no place for an unfair advantage over an enemy, and added to this was his newly acquired love of battle, so he was content to wait until his foes stood on an even footing with him before he engaged them. But they never came within reach of his ready lash. Instead, as they came above the ship's side they paused, wide-eyed and terror stricken, and with cries of fear and consternation dropped precipitately back into the sea, shouting warnings to those who were about to scale the hull.

　　Muda Saffir arose in his prahu cursing and reviling the frightened Dyaks.  He did not know the cause of their alarm, but presently he saw it behind the giant upon the Ithaca's deck-- eleven horrible monstrosities lumbering forward, snarling and growling, to their leader's side.

　　At the sight his own dark countenance went ashen, and with trembling lips he ordered his oarsmen to pull for the open sea.  The girl, too, saw the frightful creatures that surrounded the man upon the deck. She thought that they were about to attack him, and gave a little cry of warning, but in another instant she realized that they were his companions, for with him they rushed to the side of the ship to stand for a moment looking down upon the struggling Dyaks in the water below.

　　Two prahus lay directly beneath them, and into these the head hunters were scrambling.  The balance of the flotilla was now making rapid headway under oars and sail toward the mouth of the harbor, and as Number Thirteen saw that the girl was being borne away from him, he shouted a command to his misshapen crew, and without waiting to see if they would follow him leaped into the nearer of the two boats beneath.

　　It was already half filled with Dyaks, some of whom were hastily manning the oars.  Others of the head hunters were scrambling over the gunwale.  In an instant pandemonium reigned in the little vessel. Savage warriors sprang toward the tall figure towering above them.  Parangs flashed.  The bull whip hissed and cracked, and then into the midst of it all came a horrid avalanche of fearful and grotesque monsters-- the young giant's crew had followed at his command.

　　The battle in the prahu was short and fierce.  For an instant the Dyaks attempted to hold their own, but in the face of the snarling, rending horde that engulfed them terror got the better of them all, so that those who were not overcome dived overboard and swam rapidly toward shore.

　　The other prahu had not waited to assist its companion, but before it was entirely filled had gotten under way and was now rapidly overhauling the balance of the fleet.

　　Von Horn had been an excited witness to all that had occurred upon the tranquil bosom of the little harbor. He had been filled with astonishment at sight of the inhabitants of the court of mystery fighting under the leadership of Number Thirteen, and now he watched interestedly the outcome of the adventure.

　　The sight of the girl being borne away in the prahu of the Malay rajah to a fate worse than death, had roused in him both keen regret and savage rage, but it was the life of ease that he was losing that concerned him most. He had felt so sure of winning Professor Maxon's fortune through either a forced or voluntary marriage with the girl that his feelings now were as of one whose rightful heritage has been foully wrested from him.  The thought of the girl's danger and suffering were of but secondary consideration to him, for the man was incapable of either deep love or true chivalry.

　　Quite the contrary were the emotions which urged on the soulless creature who now found himself in undisputed possession of a Dyak war prahu.  His only thought was of the girl being rapidly borne away across the glimmering waters of the strait.  He knew not to what dangers she was exposed, or what fate threatened her. All he knew was that she had been taken by force against her will.  He had seen the look of terror in her eyes, and the dawning hope die out as the boat that carried her had turned rapidly away from the Ithaca. His one thought now was to rescue her from her abductors and return her to her father.  Of his own reward or profit he entertained no single thought--it was enough if he could fight for her.  That would be reward sufficient.

　　Neither Number Thirteen nor any of his crew had ever before seen a boat, and outside of the leader there was scarcely enough brains in the entire party to render it at all likely that they could ever navigate it, but the young man saw that the other prahus were being propelled by the long sticks which protruded from their sides, and he also saw the sails bellying with wind, though he had but a vague conception of their purpose.

　　For a moment he stood watching the actions of the men in the nearest boat, and then he set himself to the task of placing his own men at the oars and instructing them in the manner of wielding the unfamiliar implements. For an hour he worked with the brainless things that constituted his party.  They could not seem to learn what was required of them.  The paddles were continually fouling one another, or being merely dipped into the water and withdrawn without the faintest semblance of a stroke made.

　　The tiresome maneuvering had carried them about in circles back and forth across the harbor, but by it Number Thirteen had himself learned something of the proper method of propelling and steering his craft. At last, more through accident than intent, they came opposite the mouth of the basin, and then chance did for them what days of arduous endeavor upon their part might have failed to accomplish.

　　As they hung wavering in the opening, the broad strait before them, and their quarry fast diminishing to small specks upon the distant horizon, a vagrant land breeze suddenly bellied the flapping sail.  The prahu swung quickly about with nose pointed toward the sea, the sail filled, and the long, narrow craft shot out of the harbor and sped on over the dancing waters in the wake of her sisters.

　　On shore behind them the infuriated Dyaks who had escaped to the beach danced and shrieked; von Horn, from his hiding place, looked on in surprised wonder, and Bududreen's lascar cursed the fate that had left a party of forty head hunters upon the same small island with him.

　　Smaller and smaller grew the retreating prahu as, straight as an arrow, she sped toward the dim outline of verdure clad Borneo.

　　9

　　INTO SAVAGE BORNEO

　　Von Horn cursed the chance that had snatched the girl from him, but he tried to content himself with the thought that the treasure probably still rested in the cabin of the Ithaca, where Bududreen was to have deposited it.  He wished that the Dyaks would take themselves off so that he could board the vessel and carry the chest ashore to bury it against the time that fate should provide a means for transporting it to Singapore.

　　In the water below him floated the Ithaca's masts, their grisly burdens still lashed to their wave swept sides.  Bududreen lay there, his contorted features set in a horrible grimace of death which grinned up at the man he would have cheated, as though conscious of the fact that the white man would have betrayed him had the opportunity come, the while he enjoyed in anticipation the other's disappointment in the loss of both the girl and the treasure.

　　The tide was rising now, and presently the Ithaca began to float.  No sooner was it apparent that she was free than the Dyaks sprang into the water and swam to her side.  Like monkeys they scrambled aboard, swarming below deck in search, thought von Horn, of pillage. He prayed that they would not discover the chest.

　　Presently a half dozen of them leaped overboard and swam to the mass of tangled spars and rigging which littered the beach.  Selecting what they wished they returned to the vessel, and a few minutes later von Horn was chagrined to see them stepping a jury mast-- he thought the treasure lay in the Ithaca's cabin.

　　Before dark the vessel moved slowly out of the harbor, setting a course across the strait in the direction that the war prahus had taken.  When it was apparent that there was no danger that the head hunters would return, the lascar came from his hiding place, and dancing up and down upon the shore screamed warlike challenges and taunts at the retreating enemy.

　　Von Horn also came forth, much to the sailor's surprise, and in silence the two stood watching the disappearing ship.  At length they turned and made their way up the stream toward camp--there was no longer aught to fear there.  Von Horn wondered if the creatures he had loosed upon Professor Maxon had done their work before they left, or if they had all turned to mush as had Number Thirteen.

　　Once at the encampment his questions were answered, for he saw a light in the bungalow, and as he mounted the steps there were Sing and Professor Maxon just coming from the living room.

　　"Von Horn!" exclaimed the professor.  "You, then, are not dead; but where is Virginia?  Tell me that she is safe."

　　"She has been carried away" was the startling answer. "Your creatures, under the thing you wished to marry her to, have taken her to Borneo with a band of Malay and Dyak pirates.  I was alone and could do nothing to prevent them."

　　"God!" moaned the old man.  "Why did I not kill the thing when it stood within my power to do so.  Only last night he was here beside me, and now it is too late."

　　"I warned you," said von Horn, coldly.

　　"I was mad," retorted the professor.  "Could you not see that I was mad?  Oh, why did you not stop me? You were sane enough.  You at least might have forced me to abandon the insane obsession which has overpowered my reason for all these terrible months.  I am sane now, but it is too late--too late."

　　"Both you and your daughter could only have interpreted any such action on my part as instigated by self- interest, for you both knew that I wanted to make her my wife," replied the other.  "My hands were tied. I am sorry now that I did not act, but you can readily see the position in which I was placed."

　　"Can nothing be done to get her back?" cried the father. "There must be some way to save her.  Do it von Horn, and not only is my daughter yours but my wealth as well-- every thing that I possess shall be yours if you will but save her from those frightful creatures."

　　"The Ithaca is gone, too," replied the doctor.  "There is only a small boat that I hid in the jungle for some such emergency.  It will carry us to Borneo, but what can we four do against five hundred pirates and the dozen monsters you have brought into the world? No, Professor Maxon, I fear there is little hope, though I am willing to give my life in an attempt to save Virginia.  You will not forget your promise should we succeed?"

　　"No, doctor," replied the old man.  "I swear that you shall have Virginia as your wife, and all my property shall be made over to you if she is rescued."

　　Sing Lee had been a silent listener to this strange conversation.  An odd look came into his slant eyes as he heard von Horn exact a confirmation from the professor, but what passed in his shrewd mind only he could say.

　　It was too late to attempt to make a start that day for Borneo, as darkness had already fallen.  Professor Maxon and von Horn walked over to the workshop and the inner campong to ascertain what damage had been done there.

　　On their return Sing was setting the table on the verandah for the evening meal.  The two men were talking, and without making his presence noticeable the Chinaman hovered about ever within ear shot.

　　"I cannot make it out, von Horn," Professor Maxon was saying.  "Not a board broken, and the doors both apparently opened intentionally by someone familiar with locks and bolts.  Who could have done it?"

　　"You forget Number Thirteen," suggested the doctor.

　　"But the chest!" expostulated the other.  "What in the world would he want of that enormous and heavy chest?"

　　"He might have thought that it contained treasure," hazarded von Horn, in an innocent tone of voice.

　　"Bosh, my dear man," replied Professor Maxon.  "He knew nothing of treasures, or money, or the need or value of either. I tell you the workshop was opened, and the inner campong as well by some one who knew the value of money and wanted that chest, but why they should have released the creatures from the inner enclosure is beyond me."

　　"And I tell you Professor Maxon that it could have been none other than Number Thirteen," insisted von Horn. "Did I not myself see him leading his eleven monsters as easily as a captain commands his company?  The fellow is brighter than we have imagined.  He has learned much from us both, he has reasoned, and he has shrewdly guessed many things that he could not have known through experience."

　　"But his object?" asked the professor.

　　"That is simple," returned von Horn.  "You have held out hopes to him that soon he should come to live under your roof with Virginia.  The creature has been madly infatuated with her ever since the day he took her from Number One, and you have encouraged his infatuation until yesterday.  Then you regained your sanity and put him in his rightful place.  What is the result? Denied the easy prey he expected he immediately decided to take it by force, and with that end in view, and taking advantage of the series of remarkable circumstances which played into his hands, he liberated his fellows, and with them hastened to the beach in search of Virginia and in hopes of being able to fly with her upon the Ithaca.  There he met the Malay pirates, and together they formed an alliance under terms of which Number Thirteen is to have the girl, and the pirates the chest in return for transporting him and his crew to Borneo. Why it is all perfectly simple and logical, Professor Maxon; do you not see it now?"

　　"You may be right, doctor," answered the old man. "But it is idle to conjecture.  Tomorrow we can be up and doing, so let us get what sleep we can tonight. We shall need all our energies if we are to save my poor, dear girl, from the clutches of that horrid, soulless thing."

　　At the very moment that he spoke the object of his contumely was entering the dark mouth of a broad river that flowed from out of the heart of savage Borneo. In the prahu with him his eleven hideous companions now bent to their paddles with slightly increased efficiency. Before them the leader saw a fire blazing upon a tiny island in the center of the stream.  Toward this they turned their silent way.  Grimly the war prahu with its frightful freight nosed closer to the bank.

　　At last Number Thirteen made out the figures of men about the fire, and as they came still closer he was sure that they were members of the very party he had been pursuing across the broad waters for hours. The prahus were drawn up upon the bank and the warriors were preparing to eat.

　　Just as the young giants' prahu came within the circle of firelight a swarthy Malay approached the fire, dragging a white girl roughly by the arm.  No more was needed to convince Number Thirteen of the identity of the party.  With a low command to his fellows he urged them to redoubled speed.  At the same instant a Dyak warrior caught sight of the approaching boat as it sped into the full glare of the light.

　　At sight of the occupants the head hunters scattered for their own prahus.  The frightful aspect of the enemy turned their savage hearts to water, leaving no fight in their ordinarily warlike souls.

　　So quickly they moved that as the pursuing prahu touched the bank all the nearer boats had been launched, and the remaining pirates were scurrying across the little island for those which lay upon the opposite side.  Among these was the Malay who guarded the girl, but he had not been quick enough to prevent Virginia Maxon recognizing the stalwart figure standing in the bow of the oncoming craft.

　　As he dragged her away toward the prahu of Muda Saffir she cried out to the strange white man who seemed her self-appointed protector.

　　"Help!  Help!" she called.  "This way!  Across the island!" And then the brown hand of her jailer closed over her mouth. Like a tigress she fought to free herself, or to detain her captor until the rescue party should catch up with them, but the scoundrel was muscled like a bull, and when the girl held back he lifted her across his shoulder and broke into a run.

　　Rajah Muda Saffir had no stomach for a fight himself, but he was loathe to lose the prize he had but just won, and seeing that his men were panic-stricken he saw no alternative but to rally them for a brief stand that would give the little moment required to slip away in his own prahu with the girl.

　　Calling aloud for those around him to come to his support he halted fifty yards from his boat just as Number Thirteen with his fierce, brainless horde swept up from the opposite side of the island in the wake of him who bore Virginia Maxon.  The old rajah succeeded in gathering some fifty warriors about him from the crews of the two boats which lay near his.  His own men he hastened to their posts in his prahu that they might be ready to pull swiftly away the moment that he and the captive were aboard.

　　The Dyak warriors presented an awe inspiring spectacle in the fitful light of the nearby camp fire. The ferocity of their fierce faces was accentuated by the upturned, bristling tiger cat's teeth which protruded from every ear; while the long feathers of the Argus pheasant waving from their war-caps, the brilliant colors of their war-coats trimmed with the black and white feathers of the hornbill, and the strange devices upon their gaudy shields but added to the savagery of their appearance as they danced and howled, menacing and intimidating, in the path of the charging foe.

　　A single backward glance was all that Virginia Maxon found it possible to throw in the direction of the rescue party, and in that she saw a sight that lived forever in her memory.  At the head of his hideous, misshapen pack sprang the stalwart young giant straight into the heart of the flashing parangs of the howling savages.  To right and left fell the mighty bull whip cutting down men with all the force and dispatch of a steel saber. The Dyaks, encouraged by the presence of Muda Saffir in their rear, held their ground; and the infuriated, brainless things that followed the wielder of the bull whip threw themselves upon the head hunters with beating hands and rending fangs.

　　Number Ten wrested a parang from an adversary, and acting upon his example the other creatures were not long in arming themselves in a similar manner. Cutting and jabbing they hewed their way through the solid ranks of the enemy, until Muda Saffir, seeing that defeat was inevitable turned and fled toward his prahu.

　　Four of his creatures lay dead as the last of the Dyaks turned to escape from the mad white man who faced naked steel with only a rawhide whip.  In panic the head hunters made a wild dash for the two remaining prahus, for Muda Saffir had succeeded in getting away from the island in safety.

　　Number Thirteen reached the water's edge but a moment after the prow of the rajah's craft had cleared the shore and was swinging up stream under the vigorous strokes of its fifty oarsmen.  For an instant he stood poised upon the bank as though to spring after the retreating prahu, but the knowledge that he could not swim held him back--it was useless to throw away his life when the need of it was so great if Virginia Maxon was to be saved.

　　Turning to the other prahus he saw that one was already launched, but that the crew of the other was engaged in a desperate battle with the seven remaining members of his crew for possession of the boat.  Leaping among the combatants he urged his fellows aboard the prahu which was already half filled with Dyaks.  Then he shoved the boat out into the river, jumping aboard himself as its prow cleared the gravelly beach.

　　For several minutes that long, hollowed log was a veritable floating hell of savage, screaming men locked in deadly battle.  The sharp parangs of the head hunters were no match for the superhuman muscles of the creatures that battered them about; now lifting one high above his fellows and using the body as a club to beat down those nearby; again snapping an arm or leg as one might break a pipe stem; or hurling a living antagonist headlong above the heads of his fellows to the dark waters of the river.  And above them all in the thickest of the fight, towering even above his own giants, rose the mighty figure of the terrible white man, whose very presence wrought havoc with the valor of the brown warriors.

　　Two more of Number Thirteen's creatures had been cut down in the prahu, but the loss among the Dyaks had been infinitely greater, and to it was now added the desertions of the terror stricken savages who seemed to fear the frightful countenances of their adversaries even as much as they did their prowess.

　　There remained but a handful of brown warriors in one end of the boat when the advantage of utilizing their knowledge of the river and of navigation occurred to Number Thirteen.  Calling to his men he commanded them to cease killing, making prisoners of those who remained instead.  So accustomed had his pack now become to receiving and acting upon his orders that they changed their tactics immediately, and one by one the remaining Dyaks were overpowered, disarmed and held.

　　With difficulty Number Thirteen communicated with them, for among them there was but a single warrior who had ever had intercourse with an Englishman, but at last by means of signs and the few words that were common to them both he made the native understand that he would spare the lives of himself and his companions if they would help him in pursuit of Muda Saffir and the girl.

　　The Dyaks felt but little loyalty for the rascally Malay they served, since in common with all their kind they and theirs had suffered for generations at the hands of the cruel, crafty and unscrupulous race that had usurped the administration of their land.  So it was not difficult to secure from them the promise of assistance in return for their lives.

　　Number Thirteen noticed that when they addressed him it was always as Bulan, and upon questioning them he discovered that they had given him this title of honor partly in view of his wonderful fighting ability and partly because the sight of his white face emerging from out of the darkness of the river into the firelight of their blazing camp fire had carried to their impressionable minds a suggestion of the tropic moon which they admired and reverenced.  Both the name and the idea appealed to Number Thirteen and from that time he adopted Bulan as his rightful cognomen.

　　The loss of time resulting from the fight in the prahu and the ensuing peace parley permitted Muda Saffir to put considerable distance between himself and his pursuers.  The Malay's boat was now alone, for of the eight prahus that remained of the original fleet it was the only one which had taken this branch of the river, the others having scurried into a smaller southerly arm after the fight upon the island, that they might the more easily escape their hideous foemen.

　　Only Barunda, the headman, knew which channel Rajah Muda Saffir intended following, and Muda wondered why it was that the two boats that were to have borne Barunda's men did not catch up with his.  While he had left Barunda and his warriors engaged in battle with the strangers he did not for an instant imagine that they would suffer any severe loss, and that one of their boats should be captured was beyond belief. But this was precisely what had happened, and the second boat, seeing the direction taken by the enemy, had turned down stream the more surely to escape them.

　　So it was that while Rajah Muda Saffir moved leisurely up the river toward his distant stronghold waiting for the other boats of his fleet to overtake him, Barunda, the headman, guided the white enemy swiftly after him. Barunda had discovered that it was the girl alone this white man wanted.  Evidently he either knew nothing of the treasure chest lying in the bottom of Muda Saffir's boat, or, knowing, was indifferent.  In either event Barunda thought that he saw a chance to possess himself of the rich contents of the heavy box, and so served his new master with much greater enthusiasm than he had the old.

　　Beneath the paddles of the natives and the five remaining members of his pack Bulan sped up the dark river after the single prahu with its priceless freight.  Already six of the creatures of Professor Maxon's experiments had given up their lives in the service of his daughter, and the remaining six were pushing forward through the inky blackness of the jungle night into the untracked heart of savage Borneo to rescue her from her abductors though they sacrificed their own lives in the endeavor.

　　Far ahead of them in the bottom of the great prahu crouched the girl they sought.  Her thoughts were of the man she felt intuitively to possess the strength, endurance and ability to overcome every obstacle and reach her at last.  Would he come in time?  Ah, that was the question.  The mystery of the stranger appealed to her.  A thousand times she had attempted to solve the question of his first appearance on the island at the very moment that his mighty muscles were needed to rescue her from the horrible creature of her father's creation. Then there was his unaccountable disappearance for weeks; there was von Horn's strange reticence and seeming ignorance as to the circumstances which brought the young man to the island, or his equally unaccountable disappearance after having rescued her from Number One. And now, when she suddenly found herself in need of protection, here was the same young man turning up in a most miraculous fashion, and at the head of the terrible creatures of the inner campong.

　　The riddle was too deep for her--she could not solve it; and then her thoughts were interrupted by the thin, brown hand of Rajah Muda Saffir as it encircled her waist and drew her toward him.  Upon the evil lips were hot words of passion.  The girl wrenched herself from the man's embrace, and, with a little scream of terror, sprang to her feet, and as Muda Saffir arose to grasp her again she struck him full in the face with one small, clenched fist.

　　Directly behind the Malay lay the heavy chest of Professor Maxon.  As the man stepped backward to recover his equilibrium both feet struck the obstacle. For an instant he tottered with wildly waving arms in an endeavor to regain his lost balance, then, with a curse upon his lips, he lunged across the box and over the side of the prahu into the dark waters of the river.

　　10

　　DESPERATE CHANCE

　　The great chest in the bottom of Rajah Muda Saffir's prahu had awakened in other hearts as well as his, blind greed and avarice; so that as it had been the indirect cause of his disaster it now proved the incentive to another to turn the mishap to his own profit, and to the final undoing of the Malay.

　　The panglima Ninaka of the Signana Dyaks who manned Muda Saffir's war prahu saw his chief disappear beneath the swift waters of the river, but the word of command that would have sent the boat hurriedly back to pick up the swimmer was not given.  Instead a lusty cry for greater speed ahead urged the sinuous muscles gliding beneath the sleek brown hides; and when Muda Saffir rose to the surface with a cry for help upon his lips Ninaka shouted back to him in derision, consigning his carcass to the belly of the nearest crocodile.

　　In futile rage Muda Saffir called down the most terrible curses of Allah and his Prophet upon the head of Ninaka and his progeny to the fifth generation, and upon the shades of his forefathers, and upon the grim skulls which hung from the rafters of his long-house. Then he turned and swam rapidly toward the shore.

　　Ninaka, now in possession of both the chest and the girl, was rich indeed, but with Muda Saffir dead he scarce knew to whom he could dispose of the white girl for a price that would make it worth while to be burdened with the danger and responsibility of retaining her. He had had some experience of white men in the past and knew that dire were the punishments meted to those who wronged the white man's women.  All through the remainder of the long night Ninaka pondered the question deeply.  At last he turned to Virginia.

　　"Why does the big white man who leads the ourang outangs follow us?" he asked.  "Is it the chest he desires, or you?"

　　"It is certainly not the chest," replied the girl. "He wishes to take me back to my father, that is all. If you will return me to him you may keep the chest, if that is what you wish."

　　Ninaka looked at her quizzically for a moment. Evidently then she was of some value.  Possibly should he retain her he could wring a handsome ransom from the white man.  He would wait and see, it were always an easy matter to rid himself of her should circumstances require.  The river was there, deep, dark and silent, and he could place the responsibility for her loss upon Muda Saffir.

　　Shortly after day break Ninaka beached his prahu before the long-house of a peaceful river tribe.  The chest he hid in the underbrush close by his boat, and with the girl ascended the notched log that led to the verandah of the structure, which, stretching away for three hundred yards upon its tall piles, resembled a huge centipede.

　　The dwellers in the long-house extended every courtesy to Ninaka and his crew.  At the former's request Virginia was hidden away in a dark sleeping closet in one of the windowless living rooms which opened along the verandah for the full length of the house. Here a native girl brought her food and water, sitting, while she ate, in rapt contemplation of the white skin and golden hair of the strange female.

　　At about the time that Ninaka pulled his prahu upon the beach before the long-house, Muda Saffir from the safety of the concealing underbrush upon the shore saw a familiar war prahu forging rapidly up the stream.  As it approached him he was about to call aloud to those who manned it, for in the bow he saw a number of his own men; but a second glance as the boat came opposite him caused him to alter his intention and drop further into the engulfing verdure, for behind his men squatted five of the terrible monsters that had wrought such havoc with his expedition, and in the stern he saw his own Barunda in friendly converse with the mad white man who had led them.

　　As the boat disappeared about a bend in the river Rajah Muda Saffir arose, shaking his fist in the direction it had vanished and, cursing anew and volubly, damned each separate hair in the heads of the faithless Barunda and the traitorous Ninaka.  Then he resumed his watch for the friendly prahu, or smaller sampan which he knew time would eventually bring from up or down the river to his rescue, for who of the surrounding natives would dare refuse succor to the powerful Rajah of Sakkan!

　　At the long-house which harbored Ninaka and his crew, Barunda and Bulan stopped with theirs to obtain food and rest.  The quick eye of the Dyak chieftain recognized the prahu of Rajah Muda Saffir where it lay upon the beach, but he said nothing to his white companion of what it augured--it might be well to discover how the land lay before he committed himself too deeply to either faction.

　　At the top of the notched log he was met by Ninaka, who, with horror-wide eyes, looked down upon the fearsome monstrosities that lumbered awkwardly up the rude ladder in the wake of the agile Dyaks and the young white giant.

　　"What does it mean?" whispered the panglima to Barunda.

　　"These are now my friends," replied Barunda. "Where is Muda Saffir?"

　　Ninaka jerked his thumb toward the river. "Some crocodile has feasted well," he said significantly. Barunda smiled.

　　"And the girl?" he continued.  "And the treasure?"

　　Ninaka's eyes narrowed.  "They are safe," he answered.

　　"The white man wants the girl," remarked Barunda.  "He does not suspect that you are one of Muda Saffir's people. If he guessed that you knew the whereabouts of the girl he would torture the truth from you and then kill you. He does not care for the treasure.  There is enough in that great chest for two, Ninaka.  Let us be friends. Together we can divide it; otherwise neither of us will get any of it.  What do you say, Ninaka?"

　　The panglima scowled.  He did not relish the idea of sharing his prize, but he was shrewd enough to realize that Barunda possessed the power to rob him of it all, so at last he acquiesced, though with poor grace.

　　Bulan had stood near during this conversation, unable, of course, to understand a single word of the native tongue.

　　"What does the man say?" he asked Barunda.  "Has he seen anything of the prahu bearing the girl?"

　　"Yes," replied the Dyak.  "He says that two hours ago such a war prahu passed on its way up river--he saw the white girl plainly.  Also he knows whither they are bound, and how, by crossing through the jungle on foot, you may intercept them at their next stop."

　　Bulan, suspecting no treachery, was all anxiety to be off at once.  Barunda suggested that in case of some possible emergency causing the quarry to return down the river it would be well to have a force remain at the long-house to intercept them.  He volunteered to undertake the command of this party.  Ninaka, he said, would furnish guides to escort Bulan and his men through the jungle to the point at which they might expect to find Muda Saffir.

　　And so, with the girl he sought lying within fifty feet of him, Bulan started off through the jungle with two of Ninaka's Dyaks as guides--guides who had been well instructed by their panglima as to their duties. Twisting and turning through the dense maze of underbrush and close-growing, lofty trees the little party of eight plunged farther and farther into the bewildering labyrinth.

　　For hours the tiresome march was continued, until at last the guides halted, apparently to consult each other as to the proper direction.  By signs they made known to Bulan that they did not agree upon the right course to pursue from there on, and that they had decided that it would be best for each to advance a little way in the direction he thought the right one while Bulan and his five creatures remained where they were.

　　"We will go but a little way," said the spokesman, "and then we shall return and lead you in the proper direction."

　　Bulan saw no harm in this, and without a shade of suspicion sat down upon a fallen tree and watched his two guides disappear into the jungle in opposite directions.  Once out of sight of the white man the two turned back and met a short distance in the rear of the party they had deserted--in another moment they were headed for the long-house from which they had started.

　　It was fully an hour thereafter that doubts began to enter Bulan's head, and as the day dragged on he came to realize that he and his weird pack were alone and lost in the heart of a strange and tangled web of tropical jungle.

　　No sooner had Bulan and his party disappeared in the jungle than Barunda and Ninaka made haste to embark with the chest and the girl and push rapidly on up the river toward the wild and inaccessible regions of the interior.  Virginia Maxon's strong hope of succor had been gradually waning as no sign of the rescue party appeared as the day wore on.  Somewhere behind her upon the broad river she was sure a long, narrow native prahu was being urged forward in pursuit, and that  in command of it was the young giant who was now never for a moment absent from her thoughts.

　　For hours she strained her eyes over the stern of the craft that was bearing her deeper and deeper into the wild heart of fierce Borneo.  On either shore they occasionally passed a native long-house, and the girl could not help but wonder at the quiet and peace which reigned over these little settlements.  It was as though they were passing along a beaten highway in the center of a civilized community; and yet she knew that the men who lolled upon the verandahs, puffing indolently upon their cigarettes or chewing betel nut, were all head hunters, and that along the verandah rafters above them hung the grisly trophies of their prowess.

　　Yet as she glanced from them to her new captors she could not but feel that she would prefer captivity in one of the settlements they were passing--there at least she might find an opportunity to communicate with her father, or be discovered by the rescue party as it came up the river.  The idea grew upon her as the day advanced until she spent the time in watching furtively for some means of escape should they but touch the shore momentarily; and though they halted twice her captors were too watchful to permit her the slightest opportunity for putting her plan into action.

　　Barunda and Ninaka urged their men on, with brief rests, all day, nor did they halt even after night had closed down upon the river.  On, on the swift prahu sped up the winding channel which had now dwindled to a narrow stream, at intervals rushing strongly between rocky walls with a current that tested the strength of the strong, brown paddlers.

　　Long-houses had become more and more infrequent until for some time now no sign of human habitation had been visible.  The jungle undergrowth was scantier and the spaces between the boles of the forest trees more open. Virginia Maxon was almost frantic with despair as the utter helplessness of her position grew upon her. Each stroke of those slender paddles was driving her farther and farther from friends, or the possibility of rescue. Night had fallen, dark and impenetrable, and with it had come the haunting fears that creep in when the sun has deserted his guardian post.

　　Barunda and Ninaka were whispering together in low gutturals, and to the girl's distorted and fear excited imagination it seemed possible that she alone must be the subject of their plotting.  The prahu was gliding through a stretch of comparatively quiet and placid water where the stream spread out into a little basin just above a narrow gorge through which they had just forced their way by dint of the most laborious exertions on the part of the crew.

　　Virginia watched the two men near her furtively. They were deeply engrossed in their conversation. Neither was looking in her direction.  The backs of the paddlers were all toward her.  Stealthily she rose to a stooping position at the boat's side.  For a moment she paused, and then, almost noiselessly, dove overboard and disappeared beneath the black waters.

　　It was the slight rocking of the prahu that caused Barunda to look suddenly about to discover the reason for the disturbance.  For a moment neither of the men apprehended the girl's absence.  Ninaka was the first to do so, and it was he who called loudly to the paddlers to bring the boat to a stop.  Then they dropped down the river with the current, and paddled about above the gorge for half an hour.

　　The moment that Virginia Maxon felt the waters close above her head she struck out beneath the surface for the shore upon the opposite side to that toward which she had dived into the river.  She knew that if any had seen her leave the prahu they would naturally expect to intercept her on her way toward the nearest shore, and so she took this means of outwitting them, although it meant nearly double the distance to be covered.

　　After swimming a short distance beneath the surface the girl rose and looked about her.  Up the river a few yards she caught the phosphorescent gleam of water upon the prahu's paddles as they brought her to a sudden stop in obedience to Ninaka's command.  Then she saw the dark mass of the war-craft drifting down toward her.

　　Again she dove and with strong strokes headed for the shore. The next time that she rose she was terrified to see the prahu looming close behind her.  The paddlers were propelling the boat slowly in her direction-- it was almost upon her now--there was a shout from a man in the bow--she had been seen.

　　Like a flash she dove once more and, turning, struck out rapidly straight back beneath the oncoming boat. When she came to the surface again it was to find herself as far from shore as she had been when she first quitted the prahu, but the craft was now circling far below her, and she set out once again to retrace her way toward the inky mass of shore line which loomed apparently near and yet, as she knew, was some considerable distance from her.

　　As she swam, her mind, filled with the terrors of the night, conjured recollection of the stories she had heard of the fierce crocodiles which infest certain of the rivers of Borneo. Again and again she could have sworn that she felt some huge, slimy body sweep beneath her in the mysterious waters of this unknown river.

　　Behind her she saw the prahu turn back up stream, but now her mind was suddenly engaged with a new danger, for the girl realized that the strong current was bearing her down stream more rapidly than she had imagined.  Already she could hear the increasing roar of the river as it rushed, wild and tumultuous, through the entrance to the narrow gorge below her.  How far it was to shore she could not guess, or how far to the certain death of the swirling waters toward which she was being drawn by an irresistible force; but of one thing she was certain, her strength was rapidly waning, and she must reach the bank quickly.

　　With redoubled energy she struck out in one last mighty effort to reach the shore.  The tug of the current was strong upon her, like a giant hand reaching up out of the cruel river to bear her back to death.  She felt her strength ebbing quickly--her strokes now were feeble and futile.  With a prayer to her Maker she threw her hands above her head in the last effort of the drowning swimmer to clutch at even thin air for support--the current caught and swirled her downward toward the gorge, and, at the same instant her fingers touched and closed upon something which swung low above the water.

　　With the last flickering spark of vitality that remained in her poor, exhausted body Virginia Maxon clung to the frail support that a kind Providence had thrust into her hands. How long she hung there she never knew, but finally a little strength returned to her, and presently she realized that it was a pendant creeper hanging low from a jungle tree upon the bank that had saved her from the river's rapacious maw.

　　Inch by inch she worked herself upward toward the bank, and at last, weak and panting, sunk exhausted to the cool carpet of grass that grew to the water's edge. Almost immediately tired, Nature plunged her into a deep sleep.  It was daylight when she awoke, dreaming that the tall young giant had rescued her from a band of demons and was lifting her in his arms to carry her back to her father.

　　Through half open lids she saw the sunlight filtering through the leafy canopy above her--she wondered at the realism of her dream; full consciousness returned and with it the conviction that she was in truth being held close by strong arms against a bosom that throbbed to the beating of a real heart.

　　With a sudden start she opened her eyes wide to look up into the hideous face of a giant ourang outang.

　　11

　　"I AM COMING!"

　　The morning following the capture of Virginia Maxon by Muda Saffir, Professor Maxon, von Horn, Sing Lee and the sole surviving lascar from the crew of the Ithaca set out across the strait toward the mainland of Borneo in the small boat which the doctor had secreted in the jungle near the harbor.  The party was well equipped with firearms and ammunition, and the bottom of the boat was packed full with provisions and cooking utensils.  Von Horn had been careful to see that the boat was furnished with a mast and sail, and now, under a good breeze the party was making excellent time toward the mysterious land of their destination.

　　They had scarcely cleared the harbor when they sighted a ship far out across the strait.  Its erratic movements riveted their attention upon it, and later, as they drew nearer, they perceived that the strange craft was a good sized schooner with but a single short mast and tiny sail.  For a minute or two her sail would belly with the wind and the vessel make headway, then she would come suddenly about, only to repeat the same tactics a moment later.  She sailed first this way and then that, losing one minute what she had gained the minute before.

　　Von Horn was the first to recognize her.

　　"It is the Ithaca," he said, "and her Dyak crew are having a devil of a time managing her--she acts as though she were rudderless."

　　Von Horn ran the small boat within hailing distance of the dismasted hulk whose side was now lined with waving, gesticulating natives.  They were peaceful fishermen, they explained, whose prahus had been wrecked in the recent typhoon.  They had barely escaped with their lives by clambering aboard this wreck which Allah had been so merciful as to place directly in their road. Would the Tuan Besar be so good as to tell them how to make the big prahu steer?

　　Von Horn promised to help them on condition that they would guide him and his party to the stronghold of Rajah Muda Saffir in the heart of Borneo.  The Dyaks willingly agreed, and von Horn worked his small boat in close under the Ithaca's stern.  Here he found that the rudder had been all but unshipped, probably as the vessel was lifted over the reef during the storm, but a single pintle remaining in its gudgeon.  A half hour's work was sufficient to repair the damage, and then the two boats continued their journey toward the mouth of the river up which those they sought had passed the night before.

　　Inside the river's mouth an anchorage was found for the Ithaca near the very island upon which the fierce battle between Number Thirteen and Muda Saffir's forces had occurred. From the deck of the larger vessel the deserted prahu which had borne Bulan across the strait was visible, as were the bodies of the slain Dyaks and the misshapen creatures of the white giant's forces.

　　In excited tones the head hunters called von Horn's attention to these evidences of conflict, and the doctor drew his boat up to the island and leaped ashore, followed by Professor Maxon and Sing.  Here they found the dead bodies of the four monsters who had fallen in an attempt to rescue their creator's daughter, though little did any there imagine the real truth.

　　About the corpses of the four were the bodies of a dozen Dyak warriors attesting to the ferocity of the encounter and the savage prowess of the unarmed creatures who had sold their poor lives so dearly.

　　"Evidently they fell out about the possession of the captive," suggested von Horn.  "Let us hope that she did not fall into the clutches of Number Thirteen-- any fate would be better than that."

　　"God give that that has not befallen her," moaned Professor Maxon.  "The pirates might but hold her for ransom, but should that soulless fiend possess her my prayer is that she found the strength and the means to take her own life before he had an opportunity to have his way with her."

　　"Amen," agreed von Horn.

　　Sing Lee said nothing, but in his heart he hoped that Virginia Maxon was not in the power of Rajah Muda Saffir. The brief experience he had had with Number Thirteen during the fight in the bungalow had rather warmed his wrinkled old heart toward the friendless young giant, and he was a sufficiently good judge of human nature to be confident that the girl would be comparatively safe in his keeping.

　　It was quickly decided to abandon the small boat and embark the entire party in the deserted war prahu. A half hour later saw the strangely mixed expedition forging up the river, but not until von Horn had boarded the Ithaca and discovered to his dismay that the chest was not on board her.

　　Far above them on the right bank Muda Saffir still squatted in his hiding place, for no friendly prahu or sampan had passed his way since dawn.  His keen eyes roving constantly up and down the long stretch of river that was visible from his position finally sighted a war prahu coming toward him from down stream.  As it drew closer he recognized it as one which had belonged to his own fleet before his unhappy encounter with the wild white man and his abhorrent pack, and a moment later his heart leaped as he saw the familiar faces of several of his men; but who were the strangers in the stern, and what was a Chinaman doing perched there upon the bow?

　　The prahu was nearly opposite him before he recognized Professor Maxon and von Horn as the white men of the little island.  He wondered how much they knew of his part in the raid upon their encampment.  Bududreen had told him much concerning the doctor, and as Muda Saffir recalled the fact that von Horn was anxious to possess himself of both the treasure and the girl he guessed that he would be safe in the man's hands so long as he could hold out promises of turning one or the other over to him; and so, as he was tired of squatting upon the uncomfortable bank and was very hungry, he arose and hailed the passing prahu.

　　His men recognized his voice immediately and as they knew nothing of the defection of any of their fellows, turned the boat's prow toward shore without waiting for the command from von Horn.  The latter, fearing treachery, sprang to his feet with raised rifle, but when one of the paddlers explained that it was the Rajah Muda Saffir who hailed them and that he was alone von Horn permitted them to draw nearer the shore, though he continued to stand ready to thwart any attempted treachery and warned both the professor and Sing to be on guard.

　　As the prahu's nose touched the bank Muda Saffir stepped aboard and with many protestations of gratitude explained that he had fallen overboard from his own prahu the night before and that evidently his followers thought him drowned, since none of his boats had returned to search for him.  Scarcely had the Malay seated himself before von Horn began questioning him in the rajah's native tongue, not a word of which was intelligible to Professor Maxon.  Sing, however, was as familiar with it as was von Horn.

　　"Where are the girl and the treasure?" he asked.

　　"What girl, Tuan Besar?" inquired the wily Malay innocently. "And what treasure?  The white man speaks in riddles."

　　"Come, come," cried von Horn impatiently.  "Let us have no foolishness.  You know perfectly well what I mean-- it will go far better with you if we work together as friends.  I want the girl--if she is unharmed--and I will divide the treasure with you if you will help me to obtain them; otherwise you shall have no part of either. What do you say?  Shall we be friends or enemies?"

　　"The girl and the treasure were both stolen from me by a rascally panglima, Ninaka," said Muda Saffir, seeing that it would be as well to simulate friendship for the white man for the time being at least--there would always be an opportunity to use a kris upon him in the remote fastness of the interior to which Muda Saffir would lead them.

　　"What became of the white man who led the strange monsters?" asked von Horn.

　　"He killed many of my men, and the last I saw of him he was pushing up the river after the girl and the treasure," replied the Malay.

　　"If another should ask you," continued von Horn with a meaningful glance toward Professor Maxon, "it will be well to say that the girl was stolen by this white giant and that you suffered defeat in an attempt to rescue her because of your friendship for us. Do you understand?"

　　Muda Saffir nodded.  Here was a man after his own heart, which loved intrigue and duplicity.  Evidently he would be a good ally in wreaking vengeance upon the white giant who had caused all his discomfiture-- afterward there was always the kris if the other should become inconvenient.

　　At the long-house at which Barunda and Ninaka had halted, Muda Saffir learned all that had transpired, his informants being the two Dyaks who had led Bulan and his pack into the jungle.  He imparted the information to von Horn and both men were delighted that thus their most formidable enemy had been disposed of. It would be but a question of time before the inexperienced creatures perished in the dense forest-- that they ever could retrace their steps to the river was most unlikely, and the chances were that one by one they would be dispatched by head hunters while they slept.

　　Again the party embarked, reinforced by the two Dyaks who were only too glad to renew their allegiance to Muda Saffir while he was backed by the guns of the white men.  On and on they paddled up the river, gleaning from the dwellers in the various long-houses information of the passing of the two prahus with Barunda, Ninaka, and the white girl.

　　Professor Maxon was impatient to hear every detail that von Horn obtained from Muda Saffir and the various Dyaks that were interviewed at the first long-house and along the stretch of river they covered.  The doctor told him that Number Thirteen still had Virginia and was fleeing up the river in a swift prahu.  He enlarged upon the valor shown by Muda Saffir and his men in their noble attempt to rescue his daughter, and through it all Sing Lee sat with half closed eyes, apparently oblivious to all that passed before him.  What were the workings of that intricate celestial brain none can say.

　　Far in the interior of the jungle Bulan and his five monsters stumbled on in an effort to find the river. Had they known it they were moving parallel with the stream, but a few miles from it.  At times it wound in wide detours close to the path of the lost creatures, and again it circled far away from them.

　　As they travelled they subsisted upon the fruits with which they had become familiar upon the island of their creation.  They suffered greatly for lack of water, but finally stumbled upon a small stream at which they filled their parched stomachs.  Here it occurred to Bulan that it would be wise to follow the little river, since they could be no more completely lost than they now were no matter where it should lead them, and it would at least insure them plenty of fresh water.

　　As they proceeded down the bank of the stream it grew in size until presently it became a fair sized river, and Bulan had hopes that it might indeed prove the stream that they had ascended from the ocean and that soon he would meet with the prahus and possibly find Virginia Maxon herself.  The strenuous march of the six through the jungle had torn their light cotton garments into shreds so that they were all practically naked, while their bodies were scratched and bleeding from countless wounds inflicted by sharp thorns and tangled brambles through which they had forced their way.

　　Bulan still carried his heavy bull whip while his five companions were armed with the parangs they had taken from the Dyaks they had overpowered upon the island at the mouth of the river.  It was upon this strange and remarkable company that the sharp eyes of a score of river Dyaks peered through the foliage. The head hunters had been engaged in collecting camphor crystals when their quick ears caught the noisy passage of the six while yet at a considerable distance, and with ready parangs the savages crept stealthily toward the sound of the advancing party.

　　At first they were terror stricken at the hideous visages of five of the creatures they beheld, but when they saw how few their numbers, and how poorly armed they were, as well as the awkwardness with which they carried their parangs, denoting their unfamiliarity with the weapons, they took heart and prepared to ambush them.

　　What prizes those terrible heads would be when properly dried and decorated!  The savages fairly trembled in anticipation of the commotion they would cause in the precincts of their long-house when they returned with six such magnificent trophies.

　　Their victims came blundering on through the dense jungle to where the twenty sleek brown warriors lay in wait for them. Bulan was in the lead, and close behind him in single file lumbered his awkward crew.  Suddenly there was a chorus of savage cries close beside him and simultaneously he found himself in the midst of twenty cutting, slashing parangs.

　　Like lightning his bull whip flew into action, and to the astonished warriors it was as though a score of men were upon them in the person of this mighty white giant. Following the example of their leader the five creatures at his back leaped upon the nearest warriors, and though they wielded their parangs awkwardly the superhuman strength back of their cuts and thrusts sent the already blood stained blades through many a brown body.

　　The Dyaks would gladly have retreated after the first surprise of their initial attack, but Bulan urged his men on after them, and so they were forced to fight to preserve their lives at all.  At last five of them managed to escape into the jungle, but fifteen remained quietly upon the earth where they had fallen--the victims of their own over confidence.  Beside them lay two of Bulan's five, so that now the little party was reduced to four--and the problem that had faced Professor Maxon was so much closer to its own solution.

　　From the bodies of the dead Dyaks Bulan and his three companions, Number Three, Number Ten, and Number Twelve, took enough loin cloths, caps, war-coats, shields and weapons to fit them out completely, after discarding the ragged remnants of their cotton pajamas, and now, even more terrible in appearance than before, the rapidly vanishing company of soulless monsters continued their aimless wandering down the river's brim.

　　The five Dyaks who had escaped carried the news of the terrible creatures that had fallen upon them in the jungle, and of the awful prowess of the giant white man who led them. They told of how, armed only with a huge whip, he had been a match and more than a match for the best warriors of the tribe, and the news that they started spread rapidly down the river from one long-house to another until it reached the broad stream into which the smaller river flowed, and then it travelled up and down to the headwaters above and the ocean far below in the remarkable manner that news travels in the wild places of the world.

　　So it was that as Bulan advanced he found the long-houses in his path deserted, and came to the larger river and turned up toward its head without meeting with resistance or even catching a glimpse of the brown-skinned people who watched him from their hiding places in the brush.

　　That night they slept in the long-house near the bank of the greater stream, while its rightful occupants made the best of it in the jungle behind.  The next morning found the four again on the march ere the sun had scarcely lighted the dark places of the forest, for Bulan was now sure that he was on the right trail and that the new river that he had come to was indeed the same that he had traversed in the Prahu with Barunda.

　　It must have been close to noon when the young giant's ears caught the sound of the movement of some animal in the jungle a short distance to his right and away from the river.  His experience with men had taught him to be wary, for it was evident that every man's hand was against him, so he determined to learn at once whether the noise he heard came from some human enemy lurking along his trail ready to spring upon him with naked parang at a moment that he was least prepared, or merely from some jungle brute.

　　Cautiously he threaded his way through the matted vegetation in the direction of the sound.  Although a parang from the body of a vanquished Dyak hung at his side he grasped his bull whip ready in his right hand, preferring it to the less accustomed weapon of the head hunter.  For a dozen yards he advanced without sighting the object of his search, but presently his efforts were rewarded by a glimpse of a reddish, hairy body, and a pair of close set, wicked eyes peering at him from behind a giant tree.

　　At the same instant a slight movement at one side attracted his attention to where another similar figure crouched in the underbrush, and then a third, fourth and fifth became evident about him.  Bulan looked in wonderment upon the strange, man-like creatures who eyed him threateningly from every hand.  They stood fully as high as the brown Dyak warriors, but their bodies were naked except for the growth of reddish hair which covered them, shading to black upon the face and hands.

　　The lips of the nearest were raised in an angry snarl that exposed wicked looking fighting fangs, but the beasts did not seem inclined to initiate hostilities, and as they were unarmed and evidently but engaged upon their own affairs Bulan decided to withdraw without arousing them further.  As he turned to retrace his steps he found his three companions gazing in wide-eyed astonishment upon the strange new creatures which confronted them.

　　Number Ten was grinning broadly, while Number Three advanced cautiously toward one of the creatures, making a low guttural noise, that could only be interpreted as peaceful and conciliatory--more like a feline purr it was than anything else.

　　"What are you doing?" cried Bulan.  "Leave them alone. They have not offered to harm us."

　　"They are like us," replied Number Three.  "They must be our own people.  I am going with them."

　　"And I," said Number Ten.

　　"And I," echoed Number Twelve.  "At last we have found our own, let us all go with them and live with them, far away from the men who would beat us with great whips, and cut us with their sharp swords."

　　"They are not human beings," exclaimed Bulan.  "We cannot live with them."

　　"Neither are we human beings," retorted Number Twelve. "Has not von Horn told us so many times?"

　　"If I am not now a human being," replied Bulan, "I intend to be one, and so I shall act as a human being should act. I shall not go to live with savage beasts, nor shall you. Come with me as I tell you, or you shall again taste the bull whip."

　　"We shall do as we please," growled Number Ten, baring his fangs.  "You are not our master.  We have followed you as long as we intend to.  We are tired of forever walking, walking, walking through the bushes that tear our flesh and hurt us.  Go and be a human being if you think you can, but do not longer interfere with us or we shall kill you," and he looked first at Number Three and then at Number Twelve for approval of his ultimatum.

　　Number Three nodded his grotesque and hideous head-- he was so covered with long black hair that he more nearly resembled an ourang outang than a human being. Number Twelve looked doubtful.

　　"I think Number Ten is right," he said at last. "We are not human.  We have no souls.  We are things. And while you, Bulan, are beautiful, yet you are as much a soulless thing as we--that much von Horn taught us well. So I believe that it would be better were we to keep forever from the sight of men.  I do not much like the thought of living with these strange, hairy monsters, but we might find a place here in the jungle where we could live alone and in peace."

　　"I do not want to live alone," cried Number Three. "I want a mate, and I see a beautiful one yonder now. I am going after her," and with that he again started toward a female ourang outang; but the lady bared her fangs and retreated before his advance.

　　"Even the beasts will have none of us," cried Number Ten angrily. "Let us take them by force then," and he started after Number Three.

　　"Come back!" shouted Bulan, leaping after the two deserters.

　　As he raised his voice there came an answering cry from a little distance ahead--a cry for help, and it was in the agonized tones of a woman's voice.

　　"I am coming!" shouted Bulan, and without another glance at his mutinous crew he sprang through the line of menacing ourang outangs.

　　12

　　PERFIDY

　　On the morning that Bulan set out with his three monsters from the deserted long-house in which they had spent the night, Professor Maxon's party was speeding up the river, constantly buoyed with hope by the repeated reports of natives that the white girl had been seen passing in a war prahu.

　　In translating this information to Professor Maxon, von Horn habitually made it appear that the girl was in the hands of Number Thirteen, or Bulan, as they had now come to call him owing to the natives' constant use of that name in speaking of the strange, and formidable white giant who had invaded their land.

　　At the last long-house below the gorge, the head of which had witnessed Virginia Maxon's escape from the clutches of Ninaka and Barunda, the searching party was forced to stop owing to a sudden attack of fever which had prostrated the professor.  Here they found a woman who had a strange tale to relate of a remarkable sight she had witnessed that very morning.

　　It seemed that she had been straining tapioca in a little stream which flowed out of the jungle at the rear of the long-house when her attention was attracted by the crashing of an animal through the bushes a few yards above her.  As she looked she saw a huge MIAS PAPPAN cross the stream, bearing in his arms the dead, or unconscious form of a white-skinned girl with golden hair.

　　Her description of the MIAS PAPPAN was such as to half convince von Horn that she might have seen Number Three carrying Virginia Maxon, although he could not reconcile the idea with the story that the two Dyaks had told him of losing all of Bulan's monsters in the jungle.

　　Of course it was possible that they might have made their way over land to this point, but it seemed scarcely credible--and then, how could they have come into posession of Virginia Maxon, whom every report except this last agreed was still in the hands of Ninaka and Barunda.  There was always the possibility that the natives had lied to him, and the more he questioned the Dyak woman the more firmly convinced he became that this was the fact.

　　The outcome of it was that von Horn finally decided to make an attempt to follow the trail of the creature that the woman had seen, and with this plan in view persuaded Muda Saffir to arrange with the chief of the long-house at which they then were to furnish him with trackers and an escort of warriors, promising them some splendid heads should they be successful in overhauling Bulan and his pack.

　　Professor Maxon was too ill to accompany the expedition, and von Horn set out alone with his Dyak allies. For a time after they departed Sing Lee fretted and fidgeted upon the verandah of the long-house. He wholly distrusted von Horn, and from motives of his own finally decided to follow him. The trail of the party was plainly discernible, and the Chinaman had no difficulty in following them, so that they had gone no great way before he came within hearing distance of them. Always just far enough behind to be out of sight, he kept pace with the little column as it marched through the torrid heat of the morning, until a little after noon he was startled by the sudden cry of a woman in distress, and the answering shout of a man.

　　The voices came from a point in the jungle a little to his right and behind him, and without waiting for the column to return, or even to ascertain if they had heard the cries, Sing ran rapidly in the direction of the alarm.  For a time he saw nothing, but was guided by the snapping of twigs and the rustling of bushes ahead, where the authors of the commotion were evidently moving swiftly through the jungle.

　　Presently a strange sight burst upon his astonished vision. It was the hideous Number Three in mad pursuit of a female ourang outang, and an instant later he saw Number Twelve and Number Ten in battle with two males, while beyond he heard the voice of a man shouting encouragement to some one as he dashed through the jungle. It was in this last event that Sing's interest centered, for he was sure that he recognized the voice as that of Bulan, while the first cry for help which he had heard had been in a woman's voice, and Sing knew that its author could be none other than Virginia Maxon.

　　Those whom he pursued were moving rapidly through the jungle which was now becoming more and more open, but the Chinaman was no mean runner, and it was not long before he drew within sight of the object of his pursuit.

　　His first glimpse was of Bulan, running swiftly between two huge bull ourang outangs that snapped and tore at him as he bounded forward cutting and slashing at his foes with his heavy whip.  Just in front of the trio was another bull bearing in his arms the unconscious form of Virginia Maxon who had fainted at the first response to her cry for help.  Sing was armed with a heavy revolver but he dared not attempt to use it for fear that he might wound either Bulan or the girl, and so he was forced to remain but a passive spectator of what ensued.

　　Bulan, notwithstanding the running battle the two bulls were forcing upon him, was gaining steadily upon the fleeing ourang outang that was handicapped by the weight of the fair captive he bore in his huge, hairy arms. As they came into a natural clearing in the jungle the fleeing bull glanced back to see his pursuer almost upon him, and with an angry roar turned to meet the charge.

　　In another instant Bulan and the three bulls were rolling and tumbling about the ground, a mass of flying fur and blood from which rose fierce and angry roars and growls, while Virginia Maxon lay quietly upon the sward where her captor had dropped her.

　　Sing was about to rush forward and pick her up, when he saw von Horn and his Dyaks leap into the clearing, to which they had been guided by the sounds of the chase and the encounter.  The doctor halted at the sight that met his eyes--the prostrate form of the girl and the man battling with three huge bulls.

　　Then he gathered up Virginia Maxon, and with a sign to his Dyaks, who were thoroughly frightened at the mere sight of the white giant of whom they had heard such terrible stories, turned and hastened back in the direction from which they had come, leaving the man to what seemed must be a speedy and horrible death.

　　Sing Lee was astounded at the perfidy of the act. To Bulan alone was due the entire credit of having rescued Professor Maxon's daughter, and yet in the very presence of his self-sacrificing loyalty and devotion von Horn had deserted him without making the least attempt to aid him.  But the wrinkled old Chinaman was made of different metal, and had started forward to assist Bulan when a heavy hand suddenly fell upon his shoulder.  Looking around he saw the hideous face of Number Ten snarling into his.  The bloodshot eyes of the monster were flaming with rage.  He had been torn and chewed by the bull with which he had fought, and though he had finally overcome and killed the beast, a female which he had pursued had eluded him.  In a frenzy of passion and blood lust aroused by his wounds, disappointment and the taste of warm blood which still smeared his lips and face, he had been seeking the female when he suddenly stumbled upon the hapless Sing.

　　With a roar he grasped the Chinaman as though to break him in two, but Sing was not at all inclined to give up his life without a struggle, and Number Ten was quick to learn that no mean muscles moved beneath that wrinkled, yellow hide.

　　There could, however, have been but one outcome to the unequal struggle had Sing not been armed with a revolver, though it was several seconds before he could bring it into play upon the great thing that shook and tossed him about as though he had been a rat in the mouth of a terrier. But suddenly there was the sharp report of a firearm, and another of Professor Maxon's unhappy experiments sank back into the nothingness from which he had conjured it.

　　Then Sing turned his attention to Bulan and his three savage assailants, but, except for the dead body of a bull ourang outang upon the spot where he had last seen the four struggling, there was no sign either of the white man or his antagonists; nor, though he listened attentively, could he catch the slightest sound within the jungle other than the rustling of the leaves and the raucous cries of the brilliant birds that flitted among the gorgeous blooms about him.

　　For half an hour he searched in every direction, but finally, fearing that he might become lost in the mazes of the unfamiliar forest he reluctantly turned his face toward the river and the long-house that sheltered his party.

　　Here he found Professor Maxon much improved--the safe return of Virginia having acted as a tonic upon him. The girl and her father sat with von Horn upon the verandah of the long-house as Sing clambered up the notched log that led to it from the ground.  At sight of Sing's wrinkled old face Virginia Maxon sprang to her feet and ran forward to greet him, for she had been very fond of the shrewd and kindly Chinaman of whom she had seen so much during the dreary months of her imprisonment within the campong.

　　"Oh, Sing," she cried, "where have you been?  We were all so worried to think that no sooner was one of us rescued than another became lost."

　　"Sing takee walk, Linee, las all," said the grinning Chinaman. "Velly glad see Linee black 'gain," and that was all that Sing Lee had to say of the adventures through which he had just passed, and the strange sights that he had seen.

　　Again and again the girl and von Horn narrated the stirring scenes of the day, the latter being compelled to repeat all that had transpired from the moment that he had heard Virginia's cry, though it was apparent that he only consented to speak of his part in her rescue under the most considerable urging.  Very pretty modesty, thought Sing when he had heard the doctor's version of the affair.

　　"You see," said von Horn, "when I reached the spot Number Three, the brute that you thought was an ape, had just turned you over to Number Thirteen, or, as the natives now call him, Bulan.  You were then in a faint, and when I attacked Bulan he dropped you to defend himself.  I had expected a bitter fight from him after the wild tales the natives have been telling of his ferocity, but it was soon evident that he is an arrant coward, for I did not even have to fire my revolver-- a few thumps with the butt of it upon his brainless skull sent him howling into the jungle with his pack at his heels."

　　"How fortunate it is, my dear doctor," said Professor Maxon, "that you were bright enough to think of trailing the miscreant into the jungle.  But for that Virginia would still be in his clutches and by this time he would have been beyond all hope of capture. How can we ever repay you, dear friend?"

　　"That you were generous enough to arrange when we first embarked upon the search for your daughter," replied von Horn.

　　"Just so, just so," said the professor, but a shade of trouble tinged the expression of his face, and a moment later he arose, saying that he felt weak and tired and would go to his sleeping room and lie down for a while. The fact was that Professor Maxon regretted the promise he had made von Horn relative to his daughter.

　　Once before he had made plans for her marriage only to regret them later; he hoped that he had made no mistake this time, but he realized that it had scarcely been fair to Virginia to promise her to his assistant without first obtaining her consent.  Yet a promise was a promise, and, again, was it not true that but for von Horn she would have been dead or worse than dead in a short time had she not been rescued from the clutches of the soulless Bulan?  Thus did the old man justify his action, and clinch the determination that he had before reached to compel Virginia to wed von Horn should she, from some incomprehensible motive, demur. Yet he hoped that the girl would make it easy, by accepting voluntarily the man who had saved her life.

　　Left alone, or as he thought alone, with the girl in the growing shadows of the evening, von Horn thought the moment propitious for renewing his suit.  He did not consider the natives squatting about them as of sufficient consequence to consider, since they would not understand the language in which he addressed Virginia, and in the dusk he failed to note that Sing squatted with the Dyaks, close behind them.

　　"Virginia," he commenced, after an interval of silence, "often before have I broached the subject nearest to my heart, yet never have you given me much encouragement. Can you not feel for the man who would gladly give his life for you, sufficient affection to permit you to make him the happiest man in the world? I do not ask for all your love at first--that will come later. Just give me the right to cherish and protect you. Say that you will be my wife, Virginia, and we need have no more fears that the strange vagaries of your father's mind can ever again jeopardize your life or your happiness as they have in the past."

　　"I feel that I owe you my life," replied the girl in a quiet voice, "and while I am now positive that my father has entirely regained his sanity, and looks with as great abhorrence upon the terrible fate he planned for me as I myself, I cannot forget the debt of gratitude which belongs to you.

　　"At the same time I do not wish to be the means of making you unhappy, as surely would be the result were I to marry you without love.  Let us wait until I know myself better. Though you have spoken to me of the matter before, I realize now that I never have made any effort to determine whether or not I really can love you. There is time enough before we reach civilization, if ever we are fortunate enough to do so at all. Will you not be as generous as you are brave, and give me a few days before I must make you a final answer?"

　　With Professor Maxon's solemn promise to insure his ultimate success von Horn was very gentle and gracious in deferring to the girl's wishes.  The girl for her part could not put from her mind the disappointment she had felt when she discovered that her rescuer was von Horn, and not the handsome young giant whom she had been positive was in close pursuit of her abductors.

　　When Number Thirteen had been mentioned she had always pictured him as a hideous monster, similar to the creature that had seized her in the jungle beside the encampment that first day she had seen the mysterious stranger, of whom she could obtain no information either from her father or von Horn.  When she had recently insisted that the same man had been at the head of her father's creatures in an attempt to rescue her, both von Horn and Professor Maxon scoffed at the idea, until at last she was convinced that the fright and the firelight had conspired to conjure in her brain the likeness of one who was linked by memory to another time of danger and despair.

　　Virginia could not understand why it was that the face of the stranger persisted in obtruding itself in her memory. That the man was unusually good looking was undeniable, but she had known many good looking men, nor was she especially impressionable to mere superficial beauty. No words had passed between them on the occasion of their first meeting, so it could have been nothing that he said which caused the memory of him to cling so tenaciously in her mind.

　　What was it then?  Was it the memory of the moments that she had lain in his strong arms--was it the shadow of the sweet, warm glow that had suffused her as his eyes had caught hers upon his face?

　　The thing was tantalizing--it was annoying.  The girl blushed in mortification at the very thought that she could cling so resolutely to the memory of a total stranger, and--still greater humiliation--long in the secret depths of her soul to see him again.

　　She was angry with herself, but the more she tried to forget the young giant who had come into her life for so brief an instant, the more she speculated upon his identity and the strange fate that had brought him to their little, savage island only to snatch him away again as mysteriously as he had come, the less was the approval with which she looked upon the suit of Doctor von Horn.

　　Von Horn had left her, and strolled down to the river. Finally Virginia arose to seek the crude couch which had been spread for her in one of the sleeping rooms of the long-house.  As she passed a group of natives squatted nearby one of the number arose and approached her, and as she halted, half in fright, a low voice whispered:

　　"Lookee out, Linee, dloctor Hornee velly bad man."

　　"Why, Sing!" exclaimed Virginia.  "What in the world do you mean by saying such a thing as that?"

　　"Never mind, Linee; you always good to old Sing. Sing no likee see you sadee.  Dloctor Hornee velly bad man, las allee," and without another word the Chinaman turned and walked away.

　　BURIED TREASURE

　　After the escape of the girl Barunda and Ninaka had fallen out over that affair and the division of the treasure, with the result that the panglima had slipped a knife between the ribs of his companion and dropped the body overboard.

　　Barunda's followers, however, had been highly enraged at the act, and in the ensuing battle which they waged for revenge of their murdered chief Ninaka and his crew had been forced to take to the shore and hide in the jungle.

　　With difficulty they had saved the chest and dragged it after them into the mazes of the underbrush.  Finally, however, they succeeded in eluding the angry enemy, and took up their march through the interior for the head of a river which would lead them to the sea by another route, it being Ninaka's intention to dispose of the contents of the chest as quickly as possible through the assistance of a rascally Malay who dwelt at Gunung Tebor, where he carried on a thriving trade with pirates.

　　But presently it became apparent that he had not so easily escaped the fruits of his villainy as he had supposed, for upon the evening of the first day the rear of his little column was attacked by some of Barunda's warriors who had forged ahead of their fellows, with the result that the head of Ninaka's brother went to increase the prestige and glory of the house of the enemy.

　　Ninaka was panic-stricken, since he knew that hampered as he was by the heavy chest he could neither fight nor run to advantage.  And so, upon a dark night near the head waters of the river he sought, he buried the treasure at the foot of a mighty buttress tree, and with his parang made certain cabalistic signs upon the bole whereby he might identify the spot when it was safe to return and disinter his booty.  Then, with his men, he hastened down the stream until they reached the head of prahu navigation where they stole a craft and paddled swiftly on toward the sea.

　　When the three bull ourang outangs closed upon Bulan he felt no fear as to the outcome of the battle, for never in his experience had he coped with any muscles that his own mighty thews could not overcome.  But as the battle continued he realized that there might be a limit to the number of antagonists which he could successfully withstand, since he could scarcely hope with but two hands to reach the throats of three enemies, or ward off the blows and clutches of six powerful hands, or the gnashing of three sets of savage fangs.

　　When the truth dawned upon him that he was being killed the instinct of self-preservation was born in him. The ferocity with which he had fought before paled into insignificance beside the mad fury with which he now attacked the three terrible creatures upon him. Shaking himself like a great lion he freed his arms for a moment from the clinging embrace of his foemen, and seizing the neck of the nearest in his mighty clutch wrenched the head completely around.

　　There was one awful shriek from the tortured brute-- the vertebrae parted with a snap, and Bulan's antagonists were reduced to two.  Lunging and struggling the three combatants stumbled farther and farther into the jungle beyond the clearing.  With mighty blows the man buffeted the beasts to right and left, but ever they returned in bestial rage to renew the encounter.  Bulan was weakening rapidly under the terrific strain to which he had been subjected, and from loss of the blood which flowed from his wounds; yet he was slowly mastering the foaming brutes, who themselves were torn and bleeding and exhausted.  Weaker and weaker became the struggles of them all, when a sudden misstep sent Bulan stumbling headforemost against the stem of a tree, where, stunned, he sank unconscious, at the mercy of the relentless bulls.

　　They had already sprung upon the prostrate form of their victim to finish what the accident had commenced, when the loud report of Sing's revolver smote upon their startled ears as the Chinaman's bullet buried itself in the heart of Number Ten.  Never had the ourang outangs heard the sound of a firearm, and the noise, seemingly in such close proximity, filled them with such terror that on the instant they forgot all else than this new and startling fear, and with headlong haste leaped away into the jungle, leaving Bulan lying where he had fallen.

　　So it was that though Sing passed within a few paces of the unconscious man he neither saw nor heard aught of him or his antagonists.

　　When Bulan returned to consciousness the day was drawing to a close.  He was stiff and sore and weak. His head ached horribly.  He thought that he must indeed be dying, for how could one who suffered so revive? But at last he managed to stagger to his feet, and finally to reach the stream along which he had been travelling earlier in the day. Here he quenched his thirst and bathed his wounds, and as darkness came he lay down to sleep upon a bed of matted grasses.

　　The next morning found him refreshed and in considerably less pain, for the powers of recuperation which belonged to his perfect health and mighty physique had already worked an almost miraculous transformation in him. While he was hunting in the jungle for his breakfast he came suddenly upon Number Three and Number Twelve similarly employed.

　　At sight of him the two creatures started to run away, but he called to them reassuringly and they returned. On closer inspection Bulan saw that both were covered with terrible wounds, and after questioning them learned that they had fared almost as badly at the hands of the ourang outangs as had he.

　　"Even the beasts loathe us," exclaimed Number Twelve. "What are we to do?"

　　"Leave the beasts alone, as I told you," replied Bulan.

　　"Human beings hate us also," persisted Number Twelve.

　　"Then let us live by ourselves," suggested Number Three.

　　"We hate each other," retorted the pessimistic Number Twelve. "There is no place for us in the world, and no companionship. We are but soulless things."

　　"Stop!" cried Bulan.  "I am not a soulless thing. I am a man, and within me is as fine and pure a soul as any man may own," and to his mind's eye came the vision of a fair face surmounted by a mass of loosely waving, golden hair; but the brainless ones could not understand and only shook their heads as they resumed their feeding and forgot the subject.

　　When the three had satisfied the cravings of their appetites two of them were for lying down to sleep until it should be time to feed again, but Bulan, once more master, would not permit it, and forced them to accompany him in his seemingly futile search for the girl who had disappeared so mysteriously after he had rescued her from the ourang outangs.

　　Both Number Twelve and Number Three had assured him that the beasts had not recaptured her, for they had seen the entire band flee madly through the jungle after hearing the report of the single shot which had so terrorized Bulan's antagonists.  Bulan did not know what to make of this occurrence which he had not himself heard, the shot having come after he had lost consciousness at the foot of the tree; but from the description of the noise given him by Number Twelve he felt sure that it must have been the report of a gun, and hoped that it betokened the presence of Virginia Maxon's friends, and that she was now safe in their keeping.

　　Nevertheless he did not relinquish his determination to continue his search for her, since it was quite possible that the gun had been fired by a native, many of whom possessed firearms.  His first concern was for the girl's welfare, which spoke eloquently for the chivalry of his character, and though he wished to see her for the pleasure that it would give him, the hope of serving her was ever the first consideration in his mind.

　　He was now confident that he was following the wrong direction, and with the intention in view of discovering the tracks of the party which had rescued or captured Virginia after he had been forced to relinquish her, he set out in a totally new direction away from the river. His small woodcraft and little experience in travelling resulted in his becoming completely confused, so that instead of returning to the spot where he had last seen the girl, as he wished to do, he bore far to the northeast of the place, and missed entirely the path which von Horn and his Dyaks had taken from the long-house into the jungle and back.

　　All that day he urged his reluctant companions on through the fearful heat of the tropics until, almost exhausted, they halted at dusk upon the bank of a river, where they filled their stomachs with cooling draughts, and after eating lay down to sleep.  It was quite dark when Bulan was aroused by the sound of something approaching from up the river, and as he lay listening he presently heard the subdued voices of men conversing in whispers. He recognized the language as that of the Dyaks, though he could interpret nothing which they said.

　　Presently he saw a dozen warriors emerge into a little patch of moonlight.  They bore a huge chest among them which they deposited within a few paces of where Bulan lay. Then they commenced to dig in the soft earth with their spears and parangs until they had excavated a shallow pit.  Into this they lowered the chest, covering it over with earth and sprinkling dead grass, twigs and leaves above it, that it might present to a searcher no sign that the ground had recently been disturbed.  The balance of the loose earth which would not go back into the pit was thrown into the river.

　　When all had been made to appear as it was before, one of the warriors made several cuts and scratches upon the stem of a tree which grew above the spot where the chest was buried; then they hastened on in silence past Bulan and down the river.

　　As von Horn stood by the river's bank after his conversation with Virginia, he saw a small sampan approaching from up stream.  In it he made out two natives, and the stealthiness of their approach caused him to withdraw into the shadow of a large prahu which was beached close to where he had been standing.

　　When the men had come close to the landing one of them gave a low signal, and presently a native came down from the long-house.

　　"Who is it comes by night?" he asked.  "And what want you?"

　　"News has just reached us that Muda Saffir is alive," replied one of the men in the boat, "and that he sleeps this night in your long-house.  Is it true?"

　　"Yes," answered the man on shore.  "What do you wish of the Rajah Muda Saffir?"

　　"We are men of his company and we have news for him," returned the speaker in the sampan.  "Tell him that we must speak to him at once."

　　The native on shore returned to the long-house without replying.  Von Horn wondered what the important news for Muda Saffir might be, and so he remained as he had been, concealed behind the prahu.

　　Presently the old Malay came down to the water's edge-- very warily though--and asked the men whom they might be. When they had given their names he seemed relieved.

　　"Ninaka," they said, "has murdered Barunda who was taking the rajah's treasure up to the rajah's stronghold--the treasure which Ninaka had stolen after trying to murder the rajah and which Barunda had recaptured.  Now Ninaka, after murdering Barunda, set off through the jungle toward the river which leads to Gunung Tebor, and Barunda's uncle followed him with what few men he had with him; but he sent us down river to try and find you, master, and beg of you to come with many men and overtake Ninaka and punish him."

　　Muda Saffir thought for a moment.

　　"Hasten back to the uncle of Barunda and tell him that as soon as I can gather the warriors I shall come and punish Ninaka.  I have another treasure here which I must not lose, but I can arrange that it will still be here when I return for it, and then Barunda's uncle can come back with me to assist me if assistance is needed. Also, be sure to tell Barunda's uncle never to lose sight of the treasure," and Muda Saffir turned and hastened back to the long-house.

　　As the men in the sampan headed the boat's bow up stream again, von Horn ran along the jungle trail beside the river and abreast of the paddlers.  When he thought that they were out of hearing of the long-house he hailed the two.  In startled surprise the men ceased paddling.

　　"Who are you and what do you want?" asked one.

　　"I am the man to whom the chest belongs," replied von Horn. "If you will take me to Barunda's uncle before Muda Saffir reaches him you shall each have the finest rifles that the white man makes, with ammunition enough to last you a year. All I ask is that you guide me within sight of the party that pursues Ninaka; then you may leave me and tell no one what you have done, nor will I tell any.  What say you?"

　　The two natives consulted together in low tones. At last they drew nearer the shore.

　　"Will you give us each a bracelet of brass as well as the rifles?" asked the spokesman.

　　Von Horn hesitated.  He knew the native nature well. To have acquiesced too readily would have been to have invited still further demands from them.

　　"Only the rifles and ammunition," he said at last, "unless you succeed in keeping the knowledge of my presence from both Barunda's uncle and Muda Saffir. If you do that you shall have the bracelets also."

　　The prow of the sampan touched the bank.

　　"Come!" said one of the warriors.

　　Von Horn stepped aboard.  He was armed only with a brace of Colts, and he was going into the heart of the wild country of the head hunters, to pit his wits against those of the wily Muda Saffir.  His guides were two savage head hunting warriors of a pirate crew from whom he hoped to steal what they considered a fabulously rich treasure.  Whatever sins might be laid to the door of the doctor, there could be no question but that he was a very brave man!

　　Von Horn's rash adventure had been suggested by the hope that he might, by bribing some of the natives with Barunda's uncle, make way with the treasure before Muda Saffir arrived to claim it, or, failing that, learn its exact whereabouts that he might return for it with an adequate force later.  That he was taking his life in his hands he well knew, but so great was the man's cupidity that he reckoned no risk too great for the acquirement of a fortune.

　　The two Dyaks, paddling in silence up the dark river, proceeded for nearly three hours before they drew in to the bank and dragged the sampan up into the bushes. Then they set out upon a narrow trail into the jungle. It so happened that after travelling for several miles they inadvertently took another path than that followed by the party under Barunda's uncle, so that they passed the latter without being aware of it, going nearly half a mile to the right of where the trailers camped a short distance from the bivouac of Ninaka.

　　In the dead of night Ninaka and his party had crawled away under the very noses of the avengers, taking the chest with them, and by chance von Horn and the two Dyaks cut back into the main trail along the river almost at the very point that Ninaka halted to bury the treasure.

　　And so it was that Bulan was not the only one who watched the hiding of the chest.

　　When Ninaka had disappeared down the river trail Bulan lay speculating upon the strange actions he had witnessed. He wondered why the men should dig a hole in the midst of the jungle to hide away the box which he had so often seen in Professor Maxon's workshop. It occurred to him that it might be well to remember just where the thing was buried, so that he could lead the professor to it should he ever see the old man again.  As he lay thus, half dozing, his attention was attracted by a stealthy rustling in the bushes nearby, and as he watched he was dumbfounded to see von Horn creep out into the moonlight.  A moment later the man was followed by two Dyaks.  The three stood conversing in low tones, pointing repeatedly at the spot where the chest lay hidden.  Bulan could understand but little of their conversation, but it was evident that von Horn was urging some proposition to which the warriors demurred.

　　Suddenly, without an instant's warning, von Horn drew his gun, wheeled, and fired point-blank, first at one of his companions, then at the other.  Both men fell in their tracks, and scarcely had the pungent odor of the powder smoke reached Bulan's nostrils ere the white man had plunged into the jungle and disappeared.

　　Failing in his attempt to undermine the loyalty of the two Dyaks von Horn had chosen the only other way to keep the knowledge of the whereabouts of the chest from Barunda's uncle and Muda Saffir, and now his principal interest in life was to escape the vengeance of the head hunters and return to the long-house before his absence should be detected.

　　There he could form a party of natives and set out to regain the chest after Muda Saffir and Barunda's uncle had given up the quest.  That suspicion should fall on him seemed scarcely credible since the only men who knew that he had left the long-house that night lay dead upon the very spot where the treasure reposed.

　　14

　　MAN OR MONSTER?

　　When Muda Saffir turned from the two Dyaks who had brought him news of the treasure he hastened to the long-house and arousing the chief of the tribe who domiciled there explained that necessity required that the rajah have at once two war prahus fully manned. Now the power of the crafty old Malay extended from one end of this great river on which the long-house lay to the other, and though not all the tribes admitted allegiance to him, yet there were few who would not furnish him with men and boats when he required them; for his piratical cruises carried him often up and down the stream, and with his savage horde it was possible for him to wreak summary and terrible vengeance upon those who opposed him.

　　When he had explained his wishes to the chief, the latter, though at heart hating and fearing Muda Saffir, dared not refuse; but to a second proposition he offered strong opposition until the rajah threatened to wipe out his entire tribe should he not accede to his demands.

　　The thing which the chief demurred to had occurred to Muda Saffir even as he walked back from the river after conversing with the two Dyak messengers.  The thought of regaining the treasure, the while he administered punishment to the traitorous Ninaka, filled his soul with savage happiness.  Now if he could but once more possess himself of the girl!  And why not?  There was only the sick old man, a Chinaman and von Horn to prevent it, and the chances were that they all were asleep.

　　So he explained to the chief the plan that had so suddenly sprung to his wicked mind.

　　"Three men with parangs may easily quiet the old man, his assistant and the Chinaman," he said, "and then we can take the girl along with us."

　　The chief refused at first, point-blank, to be a party to any such proceedings.  He knew what had happened to the Sakkaran Dyaks after they had murdered a party of Englishmen, and he did not purpose laying himself and his tribe open to the vengeance of the white men who came in many boats and with countless guns and cannon to take a terrible toll for every drop of white blood spilled.

　　So it was that Muda Saffir was forced to compromise, and be satisfied with the chief's assistance in abducting the girl, for it was not so difficult a matter to convince the head hunter that she really had belonged to the rajah, and that she had been stolen from him by the old man and the doctor.

　　Virginia slept in a room with three Dyak women. It was to this apartment that the chief finally consented to dispatch two of his warriors.  The men crept noiselessly within the pitch dark interior until they came to the sleeping form of one of the Dyak women. Cautiously they awoke her.

　　"Where is the white girl?" asked one of the men in a low whisper.  "Muda Saffir has sent us for her. Tell her that her father is very sick and wants her, but do not mention Muda Saffir's name lest she might not come."

　　The whispering awakened Virginia and she lay wondering what the cause of the midnight conference might be, for she recognized that one of the speakers was a man, and there had been no man in the apartment when she had gone to sleep earlier in the night.

　　Presently she heard some one approach her, and a moment later a woman's voice addressed her; but she could not understand enough of the native tongue to make out precisely the message the speaker wished to convey. The words "father," "sick," and "come," however she finally understood after several repetitions, for she had picked up a smattering of the Dyak language during her enforced association with the natives.

　　The moment that the possibilities suggested by these few words dawned upon her, she sprang to her feet and followed the woman toward the door of the apartment. Immediately without the two warriors stood upon the verandah awaiting their victim, and as Virginia passed through the doorway she was seized roughly from either side, a heavy hand was clapped over her mouth, and before she could make even an effort to rebel she had been dragged to the end of the verandah, down the notched log to the ground and a moment later found herself in a war prahu which was immediately pushed into the stream.

　　Since Virginia had come to the long-house after her rescue from the ourang outangs, supposedly by von Horn, Rajah Muda Saffir had kept very much out of sight, for he knew that should the girl see him she would recognize him as the man who had stolen her from the Ithaca.  So it came as a mighty shock to the girl when she heard the hated tones of the man whom she had knocked overboard from the prahu two nights before, and realized that the bestial Malay sat close beside her, and that she was again in his power.  She looked now for no mercy, nor could she hope to again escape him so easily as she had before, and so she sat with bowed head in the bottom of the swiftly moving craft, buried in anguished thoughts, hopeless and miserable.

　　Along the stretch of black river that the prahu and her consort covered that night Virginia Maxon saw no living thing other than a single figure in a small sampan which hugged the shadows of the shore as the two larger boats met and passed it, nor answered their hail.

　　Where von Horn and his two Dyak guides had landed, Muda Saffir's force disembarked and plunged into the jungle. Rapidly they hastened along the well known trail toward the point designated by the two messengers, to come upon the spot almost simultaneously with the party under Barunda's uncle, who, startled by the two shots several hours previously, had been cautiously searching through the jungle for an explanation of them.

　　They had gone warily for fear that they might stumble upon Ninaka's party before Muda Saffir arrived with reinforcements, and but just now had they discovered the prostrate forms of their two companions. One was dead, but the other was still conscious and had just sufficient vitality left after the coming of his fellows to whisper that they had been treacherously shot by the younger white man who had been at the long-house where they had found Muda Saffir--then the fellow expired without having an opportunity to divulge the secret hiding place of the treasure, over the top of which his body lay.

　　Now Bulan had been an interested witness of all that transpired.  At first he had been inclined to come out of his hiding place and follow von Horn, but so much had already occurred beneath the branches of the great tree where the chest lay hidden that he decided to wait until morning at least, for he was sure that he had by no means seen the last of the drama which surrounded the heavy box.  This belief was strengthened by the haste displayed by both Ninaka and von Horn to escape the neighborhood as quickly as possible, as though they feared that they might be apprehended should they delay even for a moment.

　　Number Three and Number Twelve still slept, not having been aroused even by the shots fired by von Horn. Bulan himself had dozed after the departure of the doctor, but the advent of Barunda's uncle with his followers had awakened him, and now he lay wide eyed and alert as the second party, under Muda Saffir, came into view when they left the jungle trail and entered the clearing.

　　His interest in either party was but passive until he saw the khaki blouse, short skirt and trim leggins of the captive walking between two of the Dyaks of Muda Saffir's company.  At the same instant he recognized the evil features of the rajah as those of the man who had directed the abduction of Virginia Maxon from the wrecked Ithaca.

　　Like a great cat Bulan drew himself cautiously to all fours-- every nerve and muscle taut with the excitement of the moment. Before him he saw a hundred and fifty ferocious Borneo head hunters, armed with parangs, spears and sumpitans.  At his back slept two almost brainless creatures--his sole support against the awful odds he must face before he could hope to succor the divinity whose image was enshrined in his brave and simple heart.

　　The muscles stood out upon his giant forearm as he gripped the stock of his bull whip.  He believed that he was going to his death, for mighty as were his thews he knew that in the face of the horde they would avail him little, yet he saw no other way than to sit supinely by while the girl went to her doom, and that he could not do. He nudged Number Twelve.  "Silence!" he whispered, and "Come! The girl is here.  We must save her.  Kill the men," and the same to the hairy and terrible Number Three.

　　Both the creatures awoke and rose to their hands and knees without noise that could be heard above the chattering of the natives, who had crowded forward to view the dead bodies of von Horn's victims. Silently Bulan came to his feet, the two monsters at his back rising and pressing close behind him. Along the denser shadows the three crept to a position in the rear of the natives.  The girl's guards had stepped forward with the others to join in the discussion that followed the dying statement of the murdered warrior, leaving her upon the outer fringe of the crowd.

　　For an instant a sudden hope of escape sprang to Virginia Maxon's mind--there was none between her and the jungle through which they had just passed. Though unknown dangers lurked in the black and uncanny depths of the dismal forest, would not death in any form be far preferable to the hideous fate which awaited her in the person of the bestial Malay pirate?

　　She had turned to take the first step toward freedom when three figures emerged from the wall of darkness behind her.  She saw the war-caps, shields, and war- coats, and her heart sank.  Here were others of the rajah's party--stragglers who had come just in time to thwart her plans.  How large these men were--she never had seen a native of such giant proportions; and now they had come quite close to her, and as the foremost stooped to speak to her she shrank back in fear.  Then, to her surprise, she heard in whispered English; "Come quietly, while they are not looking."

　　She thought the voice familiar, but could not place it, though her heart whispered that it might belong to the young stranger of her dreams.  He reached out and took her hand and together they turned and walked quickly toward the jungle, followed by the two who had accompanied him.

　　Scarcely had they covered half the distance before one of the Dyaks whose duty it had been to guard the girl discovered that she was gone.  With a cry he alarmed his fellows, and in another instant a sharp pair of eyes caught the movement of the four who had now broken into a run.

　　With savage shouts the entire force of head hunters sprang in pursuit.  Bulan lifted Virginia in his arms and dashed on ahead of Number Twelve and Number Three. A shower of poisoned darts blown from half a hundred sumpitans fell about them, and then Muda Saffir called to his warriors to cease using their deadly blow-pipes lest they kill the girl.

　　Into the jungle dashed the four while close behind them came the howling pack of enraged savages.  Now one closed upon Number Three only to fall back dead with a broken neck as the giant fingers released their hold upon him.  A parang swung close to Number Twelve, but his own, which he had now learned to wield with fearful effect, clove through the pursuing warrior's skull splitting him wide to the breast bone.

　　Thus they fought the while they forced their way deeper and deeper into the dark mazes of the entangled vegetation. The brunt of the running battle was borne by the two monsters, for Bulan was carrying Virginia, and keeping a little ahead of his companions to insure the girl's greater safety.

　　Now and then patches of moonlight filtering through occasional openings in the leafy roofing revealed to Virginia the battle that was being waged for possession of her, and once, when Number Three turned toward her after disposing of a new assailant, she was horrified to see the grotesque and terrible face of the creature. A moment later she caught sight of Number Twelve's hideous face.  She was appalled.

　　Could it be that she had been rescued from the Malay to fall into the hands of creatures equally heartless and entirely without souls?  She glanced up at the face of him who carried her.  In the darkness of the night she had not yet had an opportunity to see the features of the man, but after a glimpse at those of his two companions she trembled to think of the hideous thing that might be revealed to her.

　　Could it be that she had at last fallen into the hands of the dreaded and terrible Number Thirteen! Instinctively she shrank from contact with the man in whose arms she had been carried without a trace of repugnance until the thought obtruded itself that he might be the creature of her father's mad experimentation, to whose arms she had been doomed by the insane obsession of her parent.

　　The man shifted her now to give himself freer use of his right arm, for the savages were pressing more closely upon Twelve and Three, and the change made it impossible for the girl to see his face even in the more frequent moonlit places.

　　But she could see the two who ran and fought just behind them, and she shuddered at her inevitable fate. For should the three be successful in bearing her away from the Dyaks she must face an unknown doom, while should the natives recapture her there was the terrible Malay into whose clutches she had already twice fallen.

　　Now the head hunters were pressing closer, and suddenly, even as the girl looked directly at him, a spear passed through the heart of Number Three. Clutching madly at the shaft protruding from his misshapen body the grotesque thing stumbled on for a dozen paces, and then sank to the ground as two of the brown warriors sprang upon him with naked parangs. An instant later Virginia Maxon saw the hideous and grisly head swinging high in the hand of a dancing, whooping savage.

　　The man who carried her was now forced to turn and fight off the enemy that pressed forward past Number Twelve. The mighty bull whip whirled and cracked across the heads and faces of the Dyaks.  It was a formidable weapon when backed by the Herculean muscles that rolled and shifted beneath Bulan's sun-tanned skin, and many were the brown warriors that went down beneath its cruel lash.

　　Virginia could see that the creature who bore her was not deformed of body, but she shrank from the thought of what a sight of his face might reveal.  How much longer the two could fight off the horde at their heels the girl could not guess; and as a matter of fact she was indifferent to the outcome of the strange, running battle that was being waged with herself as the victor's spoil.

　　The country now was becoming rougher and more open. The flight seemed to be leading into a range of low hills, where the jungle grew less dense, and the way rocky and rugged. They had entered a narrow canyon when Number Twelve went down beneath a half dozen parangs.  Again the girl saw a bloody head swung on high and heard the fierce, wild chorus of exulting victory. She wondered how long it would be ere the creature beneath her would add his share to the grim trophies of the hunt.

　　In the interval that the head hunters had paused to sever Number Twelve's head, Bulan had gained fifty yards upon them, and then, of a sudden, he came to a sheer wall rising straight across the narrow trail he had been following.  Ahead there was no way--a cat could scarce have scaled that formidable barrier--but to the right he discerned what appeared to be a steep and winding pathway up the canyon's side, and with a bound he clambered along it to where it surmounted the rocky wall.

　　There he turned, winded, to await the oncoming foe. Here was a spot where a single man might defy an army, and Bulan had been quick to see the natural advantages of it.  He placed the girl upon her feet behind a protruding shoulder of the canyon's wall which rose to a considerable distance still above them.  Then he turned to face the mob that was surging up the narrow pathway toward him.

　　At his feet lay an accumulation of broken rock from the hillside above, and as a spear sped, singing, close above his shoulder, the occurrence suggested a use for the rough and jagged missiles which lay about him in such profusion.  Many of the pieces were large, weighing twenty and thirty pounds, and some even as much as fifty.  Picking up one of the larger Bulan raised it high above his head, and then hurled it down amongst the upclimbing warriors.  In an instant pandemonium reigned, for the heavy boulder had mowed down a score of the pursuers, breaking arms and legs in its meteoric descent.

　　Missile after missile Bulan rained down upon the struggling, howling Dyaks, until, seized by panic, they turned and fled incontinently down into the depths of the canyon and back along the narrow trail they had come, and then superstitious fear completed the rout that the flying rocks had started, for one whispered to another that this was the terrible Bulan and that he had but lured them on into the hills that he might call forth all his demons and destroy them.

　　For a moment Bulan stood watching the retreating savages, a smile upon his lips, and then as the sudden equatorial dawn burst forth he turned to face the girl.

　　As Virginia Maxon saw the fine features of the giant where she had expected to find the grotesque and hideous lineaments of a monster, she gave a quick little cry of pleasure and relief.

　　"Thank God!" she cried fervently.  "Thank God that you are a man--I thought that I was in the clutches of the hideous and soulless monster, Number Thirteen."

　　The smile upon the young man's face died.  An expression of pain, and hopelessness, and sorrow swept across his features. The girl saw the change, and wondered, but how could she guess the grievous wound her words had inflicted?

　　15

　　TOO LATE

　　For a moment the two stood in silence; Bulan tortured by thoughts of the bitter humiliation that he must suffer when the girl should learn his identity; Virginia wondering at the sad lines that had come into the young man's face, and at his silence.

　　It was the girl who first spoke.  "Who are you," she asked, "to whom I owe my safety?"

　　The man hesitated.  To speak aught than the truth had never occurred to him during his brief existence. He scarcely knew how to lie.  To him a question demanded but one manner of reply--the facts.  But never before had he had to face a question where so much depended upon his answer.  He tried to form the bitter, galling words; but a vision of that lovely face suddenly transformed with horror and disgust throttled the name in his throat.

　　"I am Bulan," he said, at last, quietly.

　　"Bulan," repeated the girl.  "Bulan.  Why that is a native name.  You are either an Englishman or an American.  What is your true name?"

　　"My name is Bulan," he insisted doggedly.

　　Virginia Maxon thought that he must have some good reason of his own for wishing to conceal his identity. At first she wondered if he could be a fugitive from justice--the perpetrator of some horrid crime, who dared not divulge his true name even in the remote fastness of a Bornean wilderness; but a glance at his frank and noble countenance drove every vestige of the traitorous thought from her mind.  Her woman's intuition was sufficient guarantee of the nobility of his character.

　　"Then let me thank you, Mr. Bulan," she said, "for the service that you have rendered a strange and helpless woman."

　　He smiled.

　　"Just Bulan," he said.  "There is no need for Miss or Mister in the savage jungle, Virginia."

　　The girl flushed at the sudden and unexpected use of her given name, and was surprised that she was not offended.

　　"How do you know my name?" she asked.

　　Bulan saw that he would get into deep water if he attempted to explain too much, and, as is ever the way, discovered that one deception had led him into another; so he determined to forestall future embarrassing queries by concocting a story immediately to explain his presence and his knowledge.

　　"I lived upon the island near your father's camp," he said.  "I knew you all--by sight."

　　"How long have you lived there?" asked the girl. "We thought the island uninhabited."

　　"All my life," replied Bulan truthfully.

　　"It is strange," she mused.  "I cannot understand it. But the monsters--how is it that they followed you and obeyed your commands?"

　　Bulan touched the bull whip that hung at his side.

　　"Von Horn taught them to obey this," he said.

　　"He used that upon them?" cried the girl in horror.

　　"It was the only way," said Bulan.  "They were almost brainless-- they could understand nothing else, for they could not reason."

　　Virginia shuddered.

　　"Where are they now--the balance of them?" she asked.

　　"They are dead, poor things," he replied, sadly. "Poor, hideous, unloved, unloving monsters--they gave up their lives for the daughter of the man who made them the awful, repulsive creatures that they were."

　　"What do you mean?" cried the girl.

　　"I mean that all have been killed searching for you, and battling with your enemies.  They were soulless creatures, but they loved the mean lives they gave up so bravely for you whose father was the author of their misery-- you owe a great deal to them, Virginia."

　　"Poor things," murmured the girl, "but yet they are better off, for without brains or souls there could be no happiness in life for them.  My father did them a hideous wrong, but it was an unintentional wrong. His mind was crazed with dwelling upon the wonderful discovery he had made, and if he wronged them he contemplated a still more terrible wrong to be inflicted upon me, his daughter."

　　"I do not understand," said Bulan.

　　"It was his intention to give me in marriage to one of his soulless monsters--to the one he called Number Thirteen.  Oh, it is terrible even to think of the hideousness of it; but now they are all dead he cannot do it even though his poor mind, which seems well again, should suffer a relapse."

　　"Why do you loathe them so?" asked Bulan.  "Is it because they are hideous, or because they are soulless?"

　　"Either fact were enough to make them repulsive," replied the girl, "but it is the fact that they were without souls that made them totally impossible-- one easily overlooks physical deformity, but the moral depravity that must be inherent in a creature without a soul must forever cut him off from intercourse with human beings."

　　"And you think that regardless of their physical appearance the fact that they were without souls would have been apparent?" asked Bulan.

　　"I am sure of it," cried Virginia.  "I would know the moment I set my eyes upon a creature without a soul."

　　With all the sorrow that was his, Bulan could scarce repress a smile, for it was quite evident either that it was impossible to perceive a soul, or else that he possessed one.

　　"Just how do you distinguish the possessor of a soul?" he asked.

　　The girl cast a quick glance up at him.

　　"You are making fun of me," she said.

　　"Not at all," he replied.  "I am just curious as to how souls make themselves apparent.  I have seen men kill one another as beasts kill.  I have seen one who was cruel to those within his power, yet they were all men with souls.  I have seen eleven soulless monsters die to save the daughter of a man whom they believed had wronged them terribly--a man with a soul.  How then am I to know what attributes denote the possession of the immortal spark?  How am I to know whether or not I possess a soul?"

　　Virginia smiled.

　　"You are courageous and honorable and chivalrous-- those are enough to warrant the belief that you have a soul, were it not apparent from your countenance that you are of the higher type of mankind," she said.

　　"I hope that you will never change your opinion of me, Virginia," said the man; but he knew that there lay before her a severe shock, and before him a great sorrow when they should come to where her father was and the girl should learn the truth concerning him.

　　That he did not himself tell her may be forgiven him, for he had only a life of misery to look forward to after she should know that he, too, was equally a soulless monster with the twelve that had preceded him to a merciful death.  He would have envied them but for the anticipation of the time that he might be alone with her before she learned the truth.

　　As he pondered the future there came to him the thought that should they never find Professor Maxon or von Horn the girl need never know but that he was a human being. He need not lose her then, but always be near her. The idea grew and with it the mighty temptation to lead Virginia Maxon far into the jungle, and keep her forever from the sight of men.  And why not? Had he not saved her where others had failed?  Was she not, by all that was just and fair, his?

　　Did he owe any loyalty to either her father or von Horn? Already he had saved Professor Maxon's life, so the obligation, if there was any, lay all against the older man; and three times he had saved Virginia.  He would be very kind and good to her. She should be much happier and a thousand times safer than with those others who were so poorly equipped to protect her.

　　As he stood silently gazing out across the jungle beneath them toward the new sun the girl watched him in a spell of admiration of his strong and noble face, and his perfect physique.  What would have been her emotions had she guessed what thoughts were his! It was she who broke the silence.

　　"Can you find the way to the long-house where my father is?" she asked.

　　Bulan, startled at the question, looked up from his reverie. The thing must be faced, then, sooner than he thought. How was he to tell her of his intention?  It occurred to him to sound her first--possibly she would make no objection to the plan.

　　"You are anxious to return?" he asked.

　　"Why, yes, of course, I am," she replied.  "My father will be half mad with apprehension, until he knows that I am safe.  What a strange question, indeed."  Still, however, she did not doubt the motives of her companion.

　　"Suppose we should be unable to find our way to the long-house?" he continued.

　　"Oh, don't say such a thing," cried the girl. "It would be terrible.  I should die of misery and fright and loneliness in this awful jungle. Surely you can find your way to the river-- it was but a short march through the jungle from where we landed to the spot at which you took me away from that fearful Malay."

　　The girl's words cast a cloud over Bulan's hopes. The future looked less roseate with the knowledge that she would be unhappy in the life that he had been mapping for them.  He was silent--thinking.  In his breast a riot of conflicting emotions were waging the first great battle which was to point the trend of the man's character--would the selfish and the base prevail, or would the noble?

　　With the thought of losing her his desire for her companionship became almost a mania.  To return her to her father and von Horn would be to lose her-- of that there could be no doubt, for they would not leave her long in ignorance of his origin.  Then, in addition to being deprived of her forever, he must suffer the galling mortification of her scorn.

　　It was a great deal to ask of a fledgling morality that was yet scarcely cognizant of its untried wings; but even as the man wavered between right and wrong there crept into his mind the one great and burning question of his life--had he a soul?  And he knew that upon his decision of the fate of Virginia Maxon rested to some extent the true answer to that question, for, unconsciously, he had worked out his own crude soul hypothesis which imparted to this invisible entity the power to direct his actions only for good. Therefore he reasoned that wickedness presupposed a small and worthless soul, or the entire lack of one.

　　That she would hate a soulless creature he accepted as a foregone conclusion.  He desired her respect, and that fact helped him to his final decision, but the thing that decided him was born of the truly chivalrous nature he possessed--he wanted Virginia Maxon to be happy; it mattered not at what cost to him.

　　The girl had been watching him closely as he stood silently thinking after her last words.  She did not know the struggle that the calm face hid; yet she felt that the dragging moments were big with the question of her fate.

　　"Well?" she said at length.

　　"We must eat first," he replied in a matter-of-fact tone, and not at all as though he was about to renounce his life's happiness, "and then we shall set out in search of your father.  I shall take you to him, Virginia, if man can find him."

　　"I knew that you could," she said, simply, "but how my father and I ever can repay you I do not know--do you?"

　　"Yes," said Bulan, and there was a sudden rush of fire to his eyes that kept Virginia Maxon from urging a detailed explanation of just how she might repay him.

　　In truth she did not know whether to be angry, or frightened, or glad of the truth that she read there; or mortified that it had awakened in her a realization that possibly an analysis of her own interest in this young stranger might reveal more than she had imagined.

　　The constraint that suddenly fell upon them was relieved when Bulan motioned her to follow him back down the trail into the gorge in search of food. There they sat together upon a fallen tree beside a tiny rivulet, eating the fruit that the man gathered. Often their eyes met as they talked, but always the girl's fell before the open worship of the man's.

　　Many were the men who had looked in admiration at Virginia Maxon in the past, but never, she felt, with eyes so clean and brave and honest.  There was no guile or evil in them, and because of it she wondered all the more that she could not face them.

　　"What a wonderful soul those eyes portray," she thought, "and how perfectly they assure the safety of my life and honor while their owner is near me."

　　And the man thought: "Would that I owned a soul that I might aspire to live always near her--always to protect her."

　　When they had eaten the two set out once more in search of the river, and the confidence that is born of ignorance was theirs, so that beyond each succeeding tangled barrier of vines and creepers they looked to see the swirling stream that would lead them to the girl's father.

　　On and on they trudged, the man often carrying the girl across the rougher obstacles and through the little streams that crossed their path, until at last came noon, and yet no sign of the river they sought. The combined jungle craft of the two had been insufficient either to trace the way that they had come, or point the general direction of the river.

　　As the afternoon drew to a close Virginia Maxon commenced to lose heart--she was confident that they were lost.  Bulan made no pretence of knowing the way, the most that he would say being that eventually they must come to the river.  As a matter-of-fact had it not been for the girl's evident concern he would have been glad to know that they were irretrievably lost; but for her sake his efforts to find the river were conscientious.

　　When at last night closed down upon them the girl was, at heart, terror stricken, but she hid her true state from the man, because she knew that their plight was no fault of his.  The strange and uncanny noises of the jungle night filled her with the most dreadful forebodings, and when a cold, drizzling rain set in upon them her cup of misery was full.

　　Bulan rigged a rude shelter for her, making her lie down beneath it, and then he removed his Dyak war-coat and threw it over her, but it was hours before her exhausted body overpowered her nervous fright and won a fitful and restless slumber.  Several times Virginia became obsessed with the idea that Bulan had left her alone there in the jungle, but when she called his name he answered from close beside her shelter.

　　She thought that he had reared another for himself nearby, but even the thought that he might sleep filled her with dread, yet she would not call to him again, since she knew that he needed his rest even more than she.  And all the night Bulan stood close beside the woman he had learned to love-- stood almost naked in the chill night air and the cold rain, lest some savage man or beast creep out of the darkness after her while he slept.

　　The next day with its night, and the next, and the next were but repetitions of the first.  It had become an agony of suffering for the man to fight off sleep longer. The girl read part of the truth in his heavy eyes and worn face, and tried to force him to take needed rest, but she did not guess that he had not slept for four days and nights.

　　At last abused Nature succumbed to the terrific strain that had been put upon her, and the giant constitution of the man went down before the cold and the wet, weakened and impoverished by loss of sleep and insufficient food; for through the last two days he had been able to find but little, and that little he had given to the girl, telling her that he had eaten his fill while he gathered hers.

　　It was on the fifth morning, when Virginia awoke, that she found Bulan rolling and tossing upon the wet ground before her shelter, delirious with fever.  At the sight of the mighty figure reduced to pitiable inefficiency and weakness, despite the knowledge that her protector could no longer protect, the fear of the jungle faded from the heart of the young girl--she was no more a weak and trembling daughter of an effete civilization. Instead she was a lioness, watching over and protecting her sick mate.  The analogy did not occur to her, but something else did as she saw the flushed face and fever wracked body of the man whose appeal to her she would have thought purely physical had she given the subject any analytic consideration; and as a realization of his utter helplessness came to her she bent over him and kissed first his forehead and then his lips.

　　"What a noble and unselfish love yours has been," she murmured.  "You have even tried to hide it that my position might be the easier to bear, and now that it may be too late I learn that I love you--that I have always loved you.  Oh, Bulan, my Bulan, what a cruel fate that permitted us to find one another only to die together!"

　　16

　　SING SPEAKS

　　For a week Professor Maxon with von Horn and Sing sought for Virginia.  They could get no help from the natives of the long-house, who feared the vengeance of Muda Saffir should he learn that they had aided the white men upon his trail.

　　And always as the three hunted through the jungle and up and down the river there lurked ever near a handful of the men of the tribe of the two whom von Horn had murdered, waiting for the chance that would give them revenge and the heads of the three they followed. They feared the guns of the white men too much to venture an open attack, and at night the quarry never abated their watchfulness, so that days dragged on, and still the three continued their hopeless quest unconscious of the relentless foe that dogged their footsteps.

　　Von Horn was always searching for an opportunity to enlist the aid of the friendly natives in an effort to regain the chest, but so far he had found none who would agree to accompany him even in consideration of a large share of the booty.  It was the treasure alone which kept him to the search for Virginia Maxon, and he made it a point to direct the hunt always in the vicinity of the spot where it was buried, for a great fear consumed him that Ninaka might return and claim it before he had a chance to make away with it.

　　Three times during the week they returned and slept at the long-house, hoping each time to learn that the natives had received some news of her they sought, through the wonderful channels of communication that seemed always open across the trackless jungle and up and down the savage, lonely rivers.

　　For two days Bulan lay raving in the delirium of fever, while the delicate girl, unused to hardship and exposure, watched over him and nursed him with the loving tenderness and care of a young mother with her first born.

　　For the most part the young giant's ravings were inarticulate, but now and then Virginia heard her name linked with words of reverence and worship. The man fought again the recent battles he had passed through, and again suffered the long night watches beside the sleeping girl who filled his heart.  Then it was that she learned the truth of his self-sacrificing devotion. The thing that puzzled her most was the repetition of a number and a name which ran through all his delirium-- "Nine ninety nine Priscilla."

　　She could make neither head nor tail of it, nor was there another word to give a clue to its meaning, so at last from constant repetition it became a commonplace and she gave it no further thought.

　　The girl had given up hope that Bulan ever could recover, so weak and emaciated had he become, and when the fever finally left him quite suddenly she was positive that it was the beginning of the end. It was on the morning of the seventh day since they had commenced their wandering in search of the long-house that, as she sat watching him, she saw his eyes resting upon her face with a look of recognition.

　　Gently she took his hand, and at the act he smiled at her very weakly.

　　"You are better, Bulan," she said.  "You have been very sick, but now you shall soon be well again."

　　She did not believe her own words, yet the mere saying of them gave her renewed hope.

　　"Yes," replied the man.  "I shall soon be well again. How long have I been like this?"

　　"For two days," she replied.

　　"And you have watched over me alone in the jungle for two days?" he asked incredulously.

　　"Had it been for life," she said in a low voice, "it would scarce have repaid the debt I owe you."

　　For a long time he lay looking up into her eyes-- longingly, wistfully.

　　"I wish that it had been for life," he said.

　　At first she did not quite realize what he meant, but presently the tired and hopeless expression of his eyes brought to her a sudden knowledge of his meaning.

　　"Oh, Bulan," she cried, "you must not say that. Why should you wish to die?"

　　"Because I love you, Virginia," he replied. "And because, when you know what I am, you will hate and loathe me."

　　On the girl's lips was an avowal of her own love, but as she bent closer to whisper the words in his ear there came the sound of men crashing through the jungle, and as she turned to face the peril that she thought approaching, von Horn sprang into view, while directly behind him came her father and Sing Lee.

　　Bulan saw them at the same instant, and as Virginia ran forward to greet her father he staggered weakly to his feet. Von Horn was the first to see the young giant, and with an oath sprang toward him, drawing his revolver as he came.

　　"You beast," he cried.  "We have caught you at last."

　　At the words Virginia turned back toward Bulan with a little scream of warning and of horror. Professor Maxon was behind her.

　　"Shoot the monster, von Horn," he ordered. "Do not let him escape."

　　Bulan drew himself to his full height, and though he wavered from weakness, yet he towered mighty and magnificent above the evil faced man who menaced him.

　　"Shoot!" he said calmly.  "Death cannot come too soon now."

　　At the same instant von Horn pulled the trigger. The giant's head fell back, he staggered, whirled about, and crumpled to the earth just as Virginia Maxon's arms closed about him.

　　Von Horn rushed close and pushing the girl aside pressed the muzzle of his gun to Bulan's temple, but an avalanche of wrinkled, yellow skin was upon him before he could pull the trigger a second time, and Sing had hurled him back a dozen feet and snatched his weapon.

　　Moaning and sobbing Virginia threw herself upon the body of the man she loved, while Professor Maxon hurried to her side to drag her away from the soulless thing for whom he had once intended her.

　　Like a tigress the girl turned upon the two white men.

　　"You are murderers," she cried.  "Cowardly murderers. Weak and exhausted by fever he could not combat you, and so you have robbed the world of one of the noblest men that God ever created."

　　"Hush!" cried Professor Maxon.  "Hush, child, you do not know what you say.  The thing was a monster-- a soulless monster."

　　At the words the girl looked up quickly at her father, a faint realization of his meaning striking her like a blow in the face.

　　"What do you mean?" she whispered.  "Who was he?"

　　It was von Horn who answered.

　　"No god created that," he said, with a contemptuous glance at the still body of the man at their feet. "He was one of the creatures of your father's mad experiments--the soulless thing for whose arms his insane obsession doomed you.  The thing at your feet, Virginia, was Number Thirteen."

　　With a piteous little moan the girl turned back toward the body of the young giant.  A faltering step she took toward it, and then to the horror of her father she sank upon her knees beside it and lifting the man's head in her arms covered the face with kisses.

　　"Virginia!" cried the professor.  "Are you mad, child?"

　　"I am not mad," she moaned, "not yet.  I love him. Man or monster, it would have been all the same to me, for I loved him."

　　Her father turned away, burying his face in his hands.

　　"God!" he muttered.  "What an awful punishment you have visited upon me for the sin of the thing I did."

　　The silence which followed was broken by Sing who had kneeled opposite Virginia upon the other side of Bulan, where he was feeling the giant's wrists and pressing his ear close above his heart.

　　"Do'n cly, Linee," said the kindly old Chinaman. "Him no dlead."  Then, as he poured a pinch of brownish powder into the man's mouth from a tiny sack he had brought forth from the depths of one of his sleeves: "Him no mlonster either, Linee.  Him white man, alsame Mlaxon.  Sing know."

　　The girl looked up at him in gratitude.

　　"He is not dead, Sing?  He will live?" she cried. "I don't care about anything else, Sing, if you will only make him live."

　　"Him live.  Gettem lilee flesh wounds.  Las all."

　　"What do you mean by saying that he is not a monster?" demanded von Horn.

　　"You waitee, you dam flool," cried Sing.  "I tellee lot more I know.  You waitee I flixee him, and then, by God, I flixee you."

　　Von Horn took a menacing step toward the Chinaman, his face black with wrath, but Professor Maxon interposed.

　　"This has gone quite far enough, Doctor von Horn," he said. "It may be that we acted hastily.  I do not know, of course, what Sing means, but I intend to find out.  He has been very faithful to us, and deserves every consideration."

　　Von Horn stepped back, still scowling.  Sing poured a little water between Bulan's lips, and then asked Professor Maxon for his brandy flask.  With the first few drops of the fiery liquid the giant's eyelids moved, and a moment later he raised them and looked about him.

　　The first face he saw was Virginia's.  It was full of love and compassion.

　　"They have not told you yet?" he asked.

　　"Yes," she replied.  "They have told me, but it makes no difference.  You have given me the right to say it, Bulan, and I do say it now again, before them all-- I love you, and that is all there is that makes any difference."

　　A look of happiness lighted his face momentarily, only to fade as quickly as it had come.

　　"No, Virginia," he said, sadly, "it would not be right. It would be wicked.  I am not a human being.  I am only a soulless monster.  You cannot mate with such as I. You must go away with your father.  Soon you will forget me."

　　"Never, Bulan!" cried the girl, determinedly.

　　The man was about to attempt to dissuade her, when Sing interrupted.

　　"You keepee still, Bulan," he said.  "You wait till Sing tellee. You no mlonster.  Mlaxon he no makee you.  Sing he find you in low bloat jus' outsidee cove.  You dummy.  No know nothing. No know namee.  No know where comee from.  No talkee.

　　"Sing he jes' hearee Mlaxon tellee Hornee 'bout Nlumber Thlirteen.  How he makee him for Linee.  Makee Linee mally him.  Sing he know what kindee fleaks Mlaxon makee. Linee always good to old Sing.  Sing he been peeking thlu clack in wallee.  See blig vlat where Thlirteen growing.

　　"Sing he takee you to Sing's shackee that night. Hide you till evlybody sleep.  Then he sneak you in workee shop.  Kickee over vlat.  Leaves you. Nex' mlorning Mlaxon makee blig hulabaloo. Dance up and downee. Whoop!  Thlirteen clome too soonee, but allight; him finee, perfec' man.  Whoop!

　　"Anyway, you heap better for Linee than one Mlaxon's fleaks," he concluded, turning toward Bulan.

　　"You are lying, you yellow devil," cried von Horn.

　　The Chinaman turned his shrewd, slant eyes malevolently upon the doctor.

　　"Sing lies?" he hissed.  "Mabbeso Sing lies when he ask what for you glet Bludleen steal tleasure. But Lajah Saffir he come and spoil it all while you tly glet Linee to the ship--Sing knows.

　　"Then you tellee Mlaxon Thlirteen steal Linee. You lie then and you knew you lie.  You lie again when Thlirteen savee Linee flom Oulang Outang-- you say you savee Linee.

　　"Then you make bad talkee with Lajah Saffir at long-house. Sing hear you all timee.  You tly getee tleasure away from Dlyaks for your self.  Then--"

　　"Stop!" roared von Horn.  "Stop!  You lying yellow sneak, before I put a bullet in you."

　　"Both of you may stop now," said Professor Maxon authoritatively.  "There have been charges made here that cannot go unnoticed.  Can you prove these things Sing?" he asked turning to the Chinaman.

　　"I plove much by Bludleen's lascar.  Bludleen tell him all 'bout Hornee.  I plove some more by Dyak chief at long-house.  He knows lots.  Lajah Saffir tell him. It all tlue, Mlaxon."

　　"And it is true about this man--the thing that you have told us is true?  He is not one of those created in the laboratory?"

　　"No, Mlaxon.  You no makee fine young man like Blulan-- you know lat, Mlaxon.  You makee One, Two, Thlee-- all up to Twelve.  All fleaks.  You ought to know, Mlaxon, lat you no can makee a Blulan."

　　During these revelations Bulan had sat with his eyes fixed upon the Chinaman.  There was a puzzled expression upon his wan, blood-streaked face. It was as though he were trying to wrest from the inner temple of his consciousness a vague and tantalizing memory that eluded him each time that he felt he had it within his grasp--the key to the strange riddle that hid his origin.

　　The girl kneeled close beside him, one small hand in his. Hope and happiness had supplanted the sorrow in her face. She tore the hem from her skirt, to bandage the bloody furrow that creased the man's temple.  Professor Maxon stood silently by, watching the loving tenderness that marked each deft, little movement of her strong, brown hands.

　　The revelations of the past few minutes had shocked the old man into stupefied silence.  It was difficult, almost impossible, for him to believe that Sing had spoken the truth and that this man was not one of the creatures of his own creation; yet from the bottom of his heart he prayed that it might prove the truth, for he saw that his daughter loved the man with a love that would be stayed by no obstacle or bound by no man-made law, or social custom.

　　The Chinaman's indictment of von Horn had come as an added blow to Professor Maxon, but it had brought its own supporting evidence in the flood of recollections it had induced in the professor's mind.  Now he recalled a hundred chance incidents and conversations with his assistant that pointed squarely toward the man's disloyalty and villainy.  He wondered that he had been so blind as not to have suspected his lieutenant long before.

　　Virginia had at last succeeded in adjusting her rude bandage and stopping the flow of blood.  Bulan had risen weakly to his feet.  The girl supported him upon one side, and Sing upon the other.  Professor Maxon approached the little group.

　　"I do not know what to make of all that Sing has told us, he said.  "If you are not Number Thirteen who are you? Where did you come from?  It seems very strange indeed-- impossible, in fact.  However, if you will explain who you are, I shall be glad to--ah--consider--ah--permitting you to pay court to my daughter."

　　"I do not know who I am," replied Bulan.  "I had always thought that I was only Number Thirteen, until Sing just spoke.  Now I have a faint recollection of drifting for days upon the sea in an open boat-- beyond that all is blank.  I shall not force my attentions upon Virginia until I can prove my identity, and that my past is one which I can lay before her without shame --until then I shall not see her."

　　"You shall do nothing of the kind," cried the girl. "You love me, and I you.  My father intended to force me to marry you while he still thought that you were a soulless thing.  Now that it is quite apparent that you are a human being, and a gentleman, he hesitates, but I do not.  As I have told you before, it makes no difference to me what you are.  You have told me that you love me.  You have demonstrated a love that is high, and noble, and self-sacrificing.  More than that no girl needs to know.  I am satisfied to be the wife of Bulan-- if Bulan is satisfied to have the daughter of the man who has so cruelly wronged him."

　　An arm went around the girl's shoulders and drew her close to the man she had glorified with her loyalty and her love.  The other hand was stretched out toward Professor Maxon.

　　"Professor," said Bulan, "in the face of what Sing has told us, in the face of a disinterested comparison between myself and the miserable creatures of your experiments, is it not folly to suppose that I am one of them?  Some day I shall recall my past, until that time shall prove my worthiness I shall not ask for Virginia's hand, and in this decision she must concur, for the truth might reveal some insurmountable obstacle to our marriage.  In the meantime let us be friends, professor, for we are both actuated by the same desire-- the welfare and happiness of your daughter."

　　The old man stepped forward and took Bulan's hand. The expression of doubt and worry had left his face.

　　"I cannot believe," he said, "that you are other than a gentleman, and if, in my desire to protect Virginia, I have said aught to wound you I ask your forgiveness."

　　Bulan responded only with a tighter pressure of the hand.

　　"And now," said the professor, "let us return to the long-house.  I wish to have a few words in private with you, von Horn," and he turned to face his assistant, but the man had disappeared.

　　"Where is Doctor von Horn?" exclaimed the scientist, addressing Sing.

　　"Hornee, him vamoose long time 'go," replied the Chinaman.  "He hear all he likee."

　　Slowly the little party wound along the jungle trail, and in less than a mile, to Virginia's infinite surprise, came out upon the river and the long-house that she and Bulan had searched for in vain.

　　"And to think," she cried, "that all these awful days we have been almost within sound of your voices. What strange freak of fate sent you to us today?"

　　"We had about given up hope," replied her father, "when Sing suggested to me that we cut across the highlands that separate this valley from the one adjoining it upon the northeast, where we should strike other tribes and from them glean some clue to your whereabouts in case your abductors had attempted to carry you back to the sea by another route.  This seemed likely in view of the fact that we were assured by enemies of Muda Saffir that you were not in his possession, and that the river we were bound for would lead your captors most quickly out of the domains of that rascally Malay. You may imagine our surprise, Virginia, when after proceeding for but a mile we discovered you."

　　No sooner had the party entered the verandah of the long-house than Professor Maxon made inquiries for von Horn, only to learn that he had departed up stream in a prahu with several warriors whom he had engaged to accompany him on a "hunting expedition," having explained that the white girl had been found and was being brought to the long-house.

　　The chief further explained that he had done his best to dissuade the white man from so rash an act, as he was going directly into the country of the tribe of the two men he had killed, and there was little chance that he ever would come out alive.

　　While they were still discussing von Horn's act, and wondering at his intentions, a native on the verandah cried out in astonishment, pointing down the river. As they looked in the direction he indicated all saw a graceful, white cutter gliding around a nearby turn. At the oars were white clad American sailors, and in the stern two officers in the uniform of the United States navy.

　　17

　　999 PRISCILLA

　　As the cutter touched the bank the entire party from the long-house, whites and natives, were gathered on the shore to meet it.  At first the officers held off as though fearing a hostile demonstration, but when they saw the whites among the throng, a command was given to pull in, and a moment later one of the officers stepped ashore.

　　"I am Lieutenant May," he said, "of the U.S.S. New Mexico, flagship of the Pacific Fleet.  Have I the honor to address Professor Maxon?"

　　The scientist nodded.  "I am delighted," he said.

　　"We have been to your island, Professor," continued the officer, "and judging from the evidences of hasty departure, and the corpses of several natives there, I feared that some harm had befallen you.  We therefore cruised along the Bornean coast making inquiries of the natives until at last we found one who had heard a rumor of a party of whites being far in the interior searching for a white girl who had been stolen from them by pirates.

　　"The farther up this river we have come the greater our assurance that we were on the right trail, for scarcely a native we interrogated but had seen or heard of some of your party.  Mixed with the truth they told us were strange tales of terrible monsters led by a gigantic white man."

　　"The imaginings of childish minds," said the professor. "However, why, my dear lieutenant, did you honor me by visiting my island?"

　　The officer hesitated a moment before answering, his eyes running about over the assembly as though in search of someone.

　　"Well, Professor Maxon, to be quite frank," he said at length, "we learned at Singapore the personnel of your party, which included a former naval officer whom we have been seeking for many years.  We came to your island to arrest this man-- I refer to Doctor Carl von Horn."

　　When the lieutenant learned of the recent disappearance of the man he sought, he expressed his determination to push on at once in pursuit; and as Professor Maxon feared again to remain unprotected in the heart of the Bornean wilderness his entire party was taken aboard the cutter.

　　A few miles up the river they came upon one of the Dyaks who had accompanied von Horn, a few hours earlier. The warrior sat smoking beside a beached prahu. When interrogated he explained that von Horn and the balance of his crew had gone inland, leaving him to guard the boat.  He said that he thought he could guide them to the spot where the white man might be found.

　　Professor Maxon and Sing accompanied one of the officers and a dozen sailors in the wake of the Dyak guide. Virginia and Bulan remained in the cutter, as the latter was still too weak to attempt the hard march through the jungle. For an hour the party traversed the trail in the wake of von Horn and his savage companions.  They had come almost to the spot when their ears were assailed by the weird and blood curdling yells of native warriors, and a moment later von Horn's escort dashed into view in full retreat.

　　At sight of the white men they halted in relief, pointing back in the direction they had come, and jabbering excitedly in their native tongue. Warily the party advanced again behind these new guides; but when they reached the spot they sought, the cause of the Dyaks' panic had fled, warned, doubtless, by their trained ears of the approach of an enemy.

　　The sight that met the eyes of the searchers told all of the story that they needed to know.  A hole had been excavated in the ground, partially uncovering a heavy chest, and across this chest lay the headless body of Doctor Carl von Horn.

　　Lieutenant May turned toward Professor Maxon with a questioning look.

　　"It is he," said the scientist.

　　"But the chest?" inquired the officer.

　　"Mlaxon's tleasure," spoke up Sing Lee.  "Hornee him tly steal it for long time."

　　"Treasure!" ejaculated the professor.  "Bududreen gave up his life for this.  Rajah Muda Saffir fought and intrigued and murdered for possession of it!  Poor, misguided von Horn has died for it, and left his head to wither beneath the rafters of a Dyak long-house! It is incredible."

　　"But, Professor Maxon," said Lieutenant May, "men will suffer all these things and more for gold."

　　"Gold!" cried the professor.  "Why, man, that is a box of books on biology and eugenics."

　　"My God!" exclaimed May, "and von Horn was accredited to be one of the shrewdest swindlers and adventurers in America!  But come, we may as well return to the cutter--my men will carry the chest."

　　"No!" exclaimed Professor Maxon with a vehemence the other could not understand.  "Let them bury it again where it lies.  It and what it contains have been the cause of sufficient misery and suffering and crime. Let it lie where it is in the heart of savage Borneo, and pray to God that no man ever finds it, and that I shall forget forever that which is in it."

　　On the morning of the third day following the death of von Horn the New Mexico steamed away from the coast of Borneo.  Upon her deck, looking back toward the verdure clad hills, stood Virginia and Bulan.

　　"Thank heaven," exclaimed the girl fervently, "that we are leaving it behind us forever."

　　"Amen," replied Bulan, "but yet, had it not been for Borneo I might never have found you."

　　"We should have met elsewhere then, Bulan," said the girl in a low voice, "for we were made for one another. No power on earth could have kept us apart.  In your true guise you would have found me--I am sure of it."

　　"It is maddening, Virginia," said the man, "to be constantly straining every resource of my memory in futile endeavor to catch and hold one fleeting clue to my past.  Why, dear, do you realize that I may have been a fugitive from justice, as was von Horn, a vile criminal perhaps.  It is awful, Virginia, to contemplate the horrible possibilities of my lost past."

　　"No, Bulan, you could never have been a criminal," replied the loyal girl, "but there is one possibility that has been haunting me constantly.  It frightens me just to think of it--it is," and the girl lowered her voice as though she feared to say the thing she dreaded most, "it is that you may have loved another--that-- that you may even be married."

　　Bulan was about to laugh away any such fears when the gravity and importance of the possibility impressed him quite as fully as it had Virginia.  He saw that it was not at all unlikely that he was already a married man; and he saw too what the girl now acknowledged, that they might never wed until the mystery of his past had been cleared away.

　　"There is something that gives weight to my fear," continued Virginia, "something that I had almost forgotten in the rush and excitement of events during the past few days.  During your delirium your ravings were, for the most part, quite incoherent, but there was one name that you repeated many times--a woman's name, preceded by a number. It was `Nine ninety nine Priscilla.'  Maybe she--"

　　But Virginia got no further.  With a low exclamation of delight Bulan caught her in his arms.

　　"It is all right, dear," he cried.  "It is all right. Everything has come back to me now.  You have given me the clue.  Nine ninety nine Priscilla is my father's address--Nine ninety nine Priscilla Avenue.

　　"I am Townsend J. Harper, Jr.  You have heard of my father. Every one has since he commenced consolidating interurban traction companies.  And I'm not married, Virginia, and never have been; but I shall be if this miserable old mud scow ever reaches Singapore."

　　"Oh, Bulan," cried the girl, "how in the world did you ever happen to come to that terrible island of ours?"

　　"I came for you, dear," he replied.  "It is a long story. After dinner I will tell you all of it that I can recall. For the present it must suffice you to know that I followed you from the railway station at Ithaca half around the world for a love that had been born from a single glance at your sweet face as you passed me to enter your Pullman.

　　"On my father's yacht I reached your island after trailing you to Singapore.  It was a long and tedious hunt and we followed many blind leads, but at last we came off an island upon which natives had told us such a party as yours was living. Five of us put off in a boat to explore--that is the last that I can recall.  Sing says he found me alone in a row boat, a `dummy.'"

　　Virginia sighed, and crept closer to him.

　　"You may be the son of the great Townsend J. Harper, you have been the soulless Number Thirteen; but to me you will always be Bulan, for it was Bulan whom I learned to love."

　　End　　The Poems of Goethe

　　Translated in the original metresby Edgar Alfred Bowring

　　THE TRANSLATOR'S ORIGINAL DEDICATION.

　　TO THE COUNTESS GRANVILLE.

　　MY DEAR LADY GRANVILLE,--

　　THE reluctance which must naturally be felt by any one inventuring to give to the world a book such as the present, wherethe beauties of the great original must inevitably be diminished,if not destroyed, in the process of passing through thetranslator's hands, cannot but be felt in all its force when thattranslator has not penetrated beyond the outer courts of thepoetic fane, and can have no hope of advancing further, or ofreaching its sanctuary. But it is to me a subject of peculiarsatisfaction that your kind permission to have your nameinscribed upon this page serves to attain a twofold end--onedirect and personal, and relating to the present day; the otherreflected and historical, and belonging to times long gone by. Ofthe first little need now be said, for the privilege is whollymine, in making this dedication: as to the second, one word ofexplanation will suffice for those who have made the greatestpoet of Germany, almost of the world, their study, and to whomthe story of his life is not unknown. All who have followed thecareer of GOETHE are familiar with the name and character ofDALBERG, and also with the deep and lasting friendship thatexisted between them, from which SCHILLER too was not absent;recalling to the mind the days of old, when a Virgil and a Horaceand a Maecenas sat side by side.

　　Remembering, then, the connection that, in a former century,was formed and riveted between your illustrious ancestor and himwhom it is the object of these pages to represent, I deem it ahappy augury that the link then established finds itself notwholly severed even now (although its strength may beimmeasurably weakened in the comparison), inasmuch as this pagebrings them once more in contact, the one in the person of hisown descendant, the other in that of the translator of his Poems.

　　Believe me, with great truth,Very faithfully yours,EDGAR A. BOWRING.London, April, 1853.

　　ORIGINAL PREFACE.

　　I feel no small reluctance in venturing to give to the public awork of the character of that indicated by the title-page to thepresent volume; for, difficult as it must always be to rendersatisfactorily into one's own tongue the writings of the bards ofother lands, the responsibility assumed by the translator isimmeasurably increased when he attempts to transfer the thoughtsof those great men, who have lived for all the world and for allages, from the language in which they were originally clothed, toone to which they may as yet have been strangers. Preeminentlyis this the case with Goethe, the most masterly of all the masterminds of modern times, whose name is already inscribed on thetablets of immortality, and whose fame already extends over theearth, although as yet only in its infancy. Scarcely have twodecades passed away since he ceased to dwell among men, yet henow stands before us, not as a mere individual, like those whomthe world is wont to call great, but as a type, as an emblem--therecognised emblem and representative of the human mind in itspresent stage of culture and advancement.

　　Among the infinitely varied effusions of Goethe's pen, perhapsthere are none which are of as general interest as his Poems,which breathe the very spirit of Nature, and embody the realmusic of the feelings. In Germany, they are universally known,and are considered as the most delightful of his works. Yet inthis country, this kindred country, sprung from the same stem,and so strongly resembling her sister in so many points, they arenearly unknown. Almost the only poetical work of the greatestPoet that the world has seen for ages, that is really andgenerally read in England, is Faust, the translations of whichare almost endless; while no single person has as yet appeared toattempt to give, in an English dress, in any collective orsystematic manner, those smaller productions of the genius ofGoethe which it is the object of the present volume to lay beforethe reader, whose indulgence is requested for its manyimperfections. In addition to the beauty of the language in whichthe Poet has given utterance to his thoughts, there is a depth ofmeaning in those thoughts which is not easily discoverable atfirst sight, and the translator incurs great risk of overlookingit, and of giving a prosaic effect to that which in the originalcontains the very essence of poetry. It is probably thisdifficulty that has deterred others from undertaking the task Ihave set myself, and in which I do not pretend to do more thanattempt to give an idea of the minstrelsy of one so unrivalled,by as truthful an interpretation of it as lies in my power.

　　The principles which have guided me on the present occasion arethe same as those followed in the translation of Schiller'scomplete Poems that was published by me in 1851, namely, asliteral a rendering of the original as is consistent with goodEnglish, and also a very strict adherence to the metre of theoriginal. Although translators usually allow themselves greatlicense in both these points, it appears to me that by so doingthey of necessity destroy the very soul of the work they professto translate. In fact, it is not a translation, but a paraphrasethat they give. It may perhaps be thought that the presenttranslations go almost to the other extreme, and that a renderingof metre, line for line, and word for word, makes it impossibleto preserve the poetry of the original both in substance and insound. But experience has convinced me that it is not so, andthat great fidelity is even the most essential element ofsuccess, whether in translating poetry or prose. It was thereforevery satisfactory to me to find that the principle laid down byme to myself in translating Schiller met with the very general,if not universal, approval of the reader. At the same time, Ihave endeavoured to profit in the case of this, the younger bornof the two attempts made by me to transplant the muse of Germanyto the shores of Britain, by the criticisms, whether friendly orhostile, that have been evoked or provoked by the appearance ofits elder brother.

　　As already mentioned, the latter contained the whole of thePoems of Schiller. It is impossible, in anything like the samecompass, to give all the writings of Goethe comprised under thegeneral title of Gedichte, or poems. They contain between 30,000and 40,000 verses, exclusive of his plays. and similar works.Very many of these would be absolutely without interest to theEnglish reader,--such as those having only a local application,those addressed to individuals, and so on. Others again, fromtheir extreme length, could only be published in separatevolumes. But the impossibility of giving all need form noobstacle to giving as much as possible; and it so happens thatthe real interest of Goethe's Poems centres in those classes ofthem which are not too diffuse to run any risk when translated ofoffending the reader by their too great number. Those by far themore generally admired are the Songs and Ballads, which are about150 in number, and the whole of which are contained in thisvolume (with the exception of one or two of the former, whichhave been, on consideration, left out by me owing to theirtrifling and uninteresting nature). The same may be said of theOdes, Sonnets, Miscellaneous Poems, &c.

　　In addition to those portions of Goethe's poetical works whichare given in this complete form, specimens of the different otherclasses of them, such as the Epigrams, Elegies, &c., are added,as well as a collection of the various Songs found in his Plays,making a total number of about 400 Poems, embraced in the presentvolume.

　　A sketch of the life of Goethe is prefixed, in order that thereader may have before him both the Poet himself and the Poet'soffspring, and that he may see that the two are but one--thatGoethe lives in his works, that his works lived in him.

　　The dates of the different Poems are appended throughout, thatof the first publication being given, when that of thecomposition is unknown. The order of arrangement adopted is thatof the authorized German editions. As Goethe would never arrangethem himself in the chronological order of their composition, ithas become impossible to do so, now that he is dead. The planadopted in the present volume would therefore seem to be thebest, as it facilitates reference to the original. Thecircumstances attending or giving rise to the production of anyof the Poems will be found specified in those cases in which theyhave been ascertained by me.

　　Having said thus much by way of explanation, I now leave thebook to speak for itself, and to testify to its own character.Whether viewed with a charitable eye by the kindly reader, whowill make due allowance for the difficulties attending itsexecution, or received by the critic, who will judge of it onlyby its own merits, with the unfriendly welcome which it veryprobably deserves, I trust that I shall at least be pardoned formaking an attempt, a failure in which does not necessarily implydisgrace, and which, by leading the way, may perhaps become themeans of inducing some abler and more worthy (but not moreearnest) labourer to enter upon the same field, the riches ofwhich will remain unaltered and undiminished in value, evenalthough they may be for the moment tarnished by the hands of theless skilful workman who first endeavours to transplant them to aforeign soil.

　　PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

　　I have taken advantage of the publication of a Second Editionof my translation of the Poems of Goethe (originally published in1853), to add to the Collection a version of the much admiredclassical Poem of Hermann and Dorothea, which was previouslyomitted by me in consequence of its length. Its universalpopularity, however, and the fact that it exhibits theversatility of Goethe's talents to a greater extent than,perhaps, any other of his poetical works, seem to call for itsadmission into the present volume.

　　On the other hand I have not thought it necessary to includethe sketch of Goethe's Life that accompanied the First Edition.At the time of its publication, comparatively little was known inthis country of the incidents of his career, and my sketch wasavowedly written as a temporary stop-gap, as it were, pending theproduction of some work really deserving the tittle of a life ofGoethe. Not to mention other contributions to the literature ofthe subject, Mr. Lewis's important volumes give the Englishreader all the information he is likely to require respectingGoethe's career, and my short memoir appeared to be no longerrequired.

　　I need scarcely add that I have availed myself of thisopportunity to make whatever improvements have suggestedthemselves to me in my original version of these Poems.

　　THE POEMS OF GOETHE.

　　DEDICATION.

　　The morn arrived; his footstep quickly scared

　　The gentle sleep that round my senses clung,And I, awak'ning, from my cottage fared,

　　And up the mountain side with light heart sprung;At every step I felt my gaze ensnared

　　By new-born flow'rs that full of dew-drops hung;The youthful day awoke with ecstacy,And all things quicken'd were, to quicken me.

　　And as I mounted, from the valley rose

　　A streaky mist, that upward slowly spread,Then bent, as though my form it would enclose,

　　Then, as on pinions, soar'd above my head:My gaze could now on no fair view repose,

　　in mournful veil conceal'd, the world seem'd dead;The clouds soon closed around me, as a tomb,And I was left alone in twilight gloom.

　　At once the sun his lustre seem'd to pour,

　　And through the mist was seen a radiant light;Here sank it gently to the ground once more,

　　There parted it, and climb'd o'er wood and height.How did I yearn to greet him as of yore,

　　After the darkness waxing doubly bright!The airy conflict ofttimes was renew'd,Then blinded by a dazzling glow I stood.

　　Ere long an inward impulse prompted me

　　A hasty glance with boldness round to throw;At first mine eyes had scarcely strength to see,

　　For all around appear'd to burn and glow.Then saw I, on the clouds borne gracefully,

　　A godlike woman hov'ring to and fro.In life I ne'er had seen a form so fair--She gazed at me, and still she hover'd there.

　　"Dost thou not know me?" were the words she said

　　In tones where love and faith were sweetly bound;"Knowest thou not Her who oftentimes hath shed

　　The purest balsam in each earthly wound?Thou knows't me well; thy panting heart I led

　　To join me in a bond with rapture crown'd.Did I not see thee, when a stripling, yearningTo welcome me with tears, heartfelt and burning?"

　　"Yes!" I exclaim'd, whilst, overcome with joy,

　　I sank to earth; "I long have worshipp'd thee;Thou gav'st me rest, when passions rack'd the boy,

　　Pervading ev'ry limb unceasingly;Thy heav'nly pinions thou didst then employ

　　The scorching sunbeams to ward off from me.From thee alone Earth's fairest gifts I gain'd,Through thee alone, true bliss can be obtain'd.

　　"Thy name I know not; yet I hear thee nam'd

　　By many a one who boasts thee as his own;Each eye believes that tow'rd thy form 'tis aim'd,

　　Yet to most eyes thy rays are anguish-sown.Ah! whilst I err'd, full many a friend I claim'd,

　　Now that I know thee, I am left alone;With but myself can I my rapture share,I needs must veil and hide thy radiance fair.

　　She smiled, and answering said: "Thou see'st how wise,

　　How prudent 'twas but little to unveil!Scarce from the clumsiest cheat are clear'd thine eyes,

　　Scarce hast thou strength thy childish bars to scale,When thou dost rank thee 'mongst the deities,

　　And so man's duties to perform would'st fail!How dost thou differ from all other men?Live with the world in peace, and know thee then!"

　　"Oh, pardon me," I cried, "I meant it well:

　　Not vainly did'st thou bless mine eyes with light;For in my blood glad aspirations swell,

　　The value of thy gifts I know aright!Those treasures in my breast for others dwell,

　　The buried pound no more I'll hide from sight.Why did I seek the road so anxiously,If hidden from my brethren 'twere to be?"

　　And as I answer'd, tow'rd me turn'd her face,

　　With kindly sympathy, that god-like one;Within her eye full plainly could I trace

　　What I had fail'd in, and what rightly done.She smiled, and cured me with that smile's sweet grace,

　　To new-born joys my spirit soar'd anon;With inward confidence I now could dareTo draw yet closer, and observe her there.

　　Through the light cloud she then stretch'd forth her hand,

　　As if to bid the streaky vapour fly:At once it seemed to yield to her command,

　　Contracted, and no mist then met mine eye.My glance once more survey'd the smiling land,

　　Unclouded and serene appear'd the sky.Nought but a veil of purest white she held,And round her in a thousand folds it swell'd.

　　"I know thee, and I know thy wav'ring will.

　　I know the good that lives and glows in thee!"--Thus spake she, and methinks I hear her still--

　　"The prize long destined, now receive from me;That blest one will be safe from ev'ry ill,

　　Who takes this gift with soul of purity,--"The veil of Minstrelsy from Truth's own hand,Of sunlight and of morn's sweet fragrance plann'd.

　　"And when thou and thy friends at fierce noon-day

　　Are parched with heat, straight cast it in the air!Then Zephyr's cooling breath will round you play,

　　Distilling balm and flowers' sweet incense there;The tones of earthly woe will die away,

　　The grave become a bed of clouds so fair,To sing to rest life's billows will be seen,The day be lovely, and the night serene."--

　　Come, then, my friends! and whensoe'er ye find

　　Upon your way increase life's heavy load;If by fresh-waken'd blessings flowers are twin'd

　　Around your path, and golden fruits bestow'd,We'll seek the coming day with joyous mind!

　　Thus blest, we'll live, thus wander on our roadAnd when our grandsons sorrow o'er our tomb,Our love, to glad their bosoms, still shall bloom.

　　SONGS.-----Late resounds the early strain;Weal and woe in song remain.-----SOUND, SWEET SONG.

　　SOUND, sweet song, from some far land,Sighing softly close at hand,

　　Now of joy, and now of woe!

　　Stars are wont to glimmer so.

　　Sooner thus will good unfold;Children young and children oldGladly hear thy numbers flow.

　　1800.*-----THE NEW AMADIS.

　　IN my boyhood's days so drear

　　I was kept confined;There I sat for many a year,

　　All alone I pined,As within the womb.

　　Yet thou drov'st away my gloom,

　　Golden phantasy!I became a hero true,

　　Like the Prince Pipi,And the world roam'd through,

　　Many a crystal palace built,

　　Crush'd them with like art,And the Dragon's life-blood spilt

　　With my glitt'ring dart.Yes! I was a man!

　　Next I formed the knightly plan

　　Princess Fish to free;She was much too complaisant,

　　Kindly welcomed me,--And I was gallant.

　　Heav'nly bread her kisses proved,

　　Glowing as the wine;Almost unto death I loved.

　　Sun-s appeared to shineIn her dazzling charms.

　　Who hath torn her from mine arms?

　　Could no magic bandMake her in her flight delay?

　　Say, where now her land?Where, alas, the way?

　　1775.*-----WHEN THE FOX DIES, HIS SKIN COUNTS.*

　　(* The name of a game, known in English as "Jack's alight.")

　　WE young people in the shade

　　Sat one sultry day;Cupid came, and "Dies the Fox"

　　With us sought to play.

　　Each one of my friends then sat

　　By his mistress dear;Cupid, blowing out the torch,

　　Said: "The taper's here!"

　　Then we quickly sent around

　　The expiring brand;Each one put it hastily

　　ln his neighbour's hand.

　　Dorilis then gave it me,

　　With a scoffing jest;Sudden into flame it broke,

　　By my fingers press'd.

　　And it singed my eyes and face,

　　Set my breast on fire;Then above my head the blaze

　　Mounted ever higher.

　　Vain I sought to put it out;

　　Ever burned the flame;Stead of dying, soon the Fox

　　Livelier still became.

　　1770.-----THE HEATHROSE.

　　ONCE a boy a Rosebud spied,

　　Heathrose fair and tender,All array'd in youthful pride,--Quickly to the spot he hied,

　　Ravished by her splendour.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

　　Heathrose fair and tender!

　　Said the boy, "I'll now pick thee,

　　Heathrose fair and tender!"Said the rosebud, "I'll prick thee,So that thou'lt remember me,

　　Ne'er will I surrender!"Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

　　Heathrose fair and tender!

　　Now the cruel boy must pick

　　Heathrose fair and tender;Rosebud did her best to prick,--Vain 'twas 'gainst her fate to kick--

　　She must needs surrender.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

　　Heathrose fair and tender!

　　1779.*-----BLINDMAN'S BUFF.

　　OH, my Theresa dear!Thine eyes, I greatly fear,

　　Can through the bandage see!Although thine eyes are bound,By thee I'm quickly found,

　　And wherefore shouldst thou catch but me?

　　Ere long thou held'st me fast,With arms around me cast,

　　Upon thy breast I fell;Scarce was thy bandage gone,When all my joy was flown,

　　Thou coldly didst the blind repel.

　　He groped on ev'ry side,His limbs he sorely tried,

　　While scoffs arose all round;If thou no love wilt give,In sadness I shall live,

　　As if mine eyes remain'd still bound.

　　1770.-----CHRISTEL.

　　My senses ofttimes are oppress'd,

　　Oft stagnant is my blood;But when by Christel's sight I'm blest,

　　I feel my strength renew'd.I see her here, I see her there,

　　And really cannot tellThe manner how, the when, the where,

　　The why I love her well.

　　If with the merest glance I view

　　Her black and roguish eyes,And gaze on her black eyebrows too,

　　My spirit upward flies.Has any one a mouth so sweet,

　　Such love-round cheeks as she?Ah, when the eye her beauties meet,

　　It ne'er content can be.

　　And when in airy German dance

　　I clasp her form divine,So quick we whirl, so quick advance,

　　What rapture then like mine!And when she's giddy, and feels warm,

　　I cradle her, poor thing,Upon my breast, and in mine arm,--

　　I'm then a very king!

　　And when she looks with love on me,

　　Forgetting all but this,When press'd against my bosom, she

　　Exchanges kiss for kiss,All through my marrow runs a thrill,

　　Runs e'en my foot along!I feel so well, I feel so ill,

　　I feel so weak, so strong!

　　Would that such moments ne'er would end!

　　The day ne'er long I find;Could I the night too with her spend,

　　E'en that I should not mind.If she were in mine arms but held,

　　To quench love's thirst I'd try;And could my torments not be quell'd,

　　Upon her breast would die.

　　1776.*------THE COY ONE.

　　ONE Spring-morning bright and fair,

　　Roam'd a shepherdess and sang;Young and beauteous, free from care,

　　Through the fields her clear notes rang:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.

　　Of his lambs some two or three

　　Thyrsis offer'd for a kiss;First she eyed him roguishly,

　　Then for answer sang but this:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.

　　Ribbons did the next one offer,

　　And the third, his heart so trueBut, as with the lambs, the scoffer

　　Laugh'd at heart and ribbons too,--Still 'twas Ia! le ralla, &c.

　　1791.-----THE CONVERT.

　　As at sunset I was straying

　　Silently the wood along,Damon on his flute was playing,

　　And the rocks gave back the song,So la, Ia! &c.

　　Softly tow'rds him then he drew me;

　　Sweet each kiss he gave me then!And I said, "Play once more to me!"

　　And he kindly play'd again,So la, la! &c.

　　All my peace for aye has fleeted,

　　All my happiness has flown;Yet my ears are ever greeted

　　With that olden, blissful tone,So la, la! &c.

　　1791.-----PRESERVATION.

　　My maiden she proved false to me;

　　To hate all joys I soon began,

　　Then to a flowing stream I ran,--The stream ran past me hastily.

　　There stood I fix'd, in mute despair;

　　My head swam round as in a dream;

　　I well-nigh fell into the stream,And earth seem'd with me whirling there.

　　Sudden I heard a voice that cried--

　　I had just turn'd my face from thence--

　　It was a voice to charm each sense:"Beware, for deep is yonder tide!"

　　A thrill my blood pervaded now,

　　I look'd and saw a beauteous maid

　　I asked her name--twas Kate, she said--"Oh lovely Kate! how kind art thou!

　　"From death I have been sav'd by thee,

　　'Tis through thee only that I live;

　　Little 'twere life alone to give,My joy in life then deign to be!"

　　And then I told my sorrows o'er,

　　Her eyes to earth she sweetly threw;

　　I kiss'd her, and she kiss'd me too,And--then I talked of death no more.

　　1775.*-----THE MUSES' SON.

　　[Goethe quotes the beginning of this song in his Autobiography,as expressing the manner in which his poetical effusions used topour out from him.]

　　THROUGH field and wood to stray,And pipe my tuneful lay,--

　　'Tis thus my days are pass'd;And all keep tune with me,And move in harmony,

　　And so on, to the last.

　　To wait I scarce have powerThe garden's earliest flower,

　　The tree's first bloom in Spring;They hail my joyous strain,--When Winter comes again,

　　Of that sweet dream I sing.

　　My song sounds far and near,O'er ice it echoes clear,

　　Then Winter blossoms bright;And when his blossoms fly,Fresh raptures meet mine eye,

　　Upon the well-till'd height.

　　When 'neath the linden tree,Young folks I chance to see,

　　I set them moving soon;His nose the dull lad curls,The formal maiden whirls,

　　Obedient to my tune.

　　Wings to the feet ye lend,O'er hill and vale ye send

　　The lover far from home;When shall I, on your breast,.

　　Ye kindly muses, rest,And cease at length to roam?

　　1800.*------FOUND.

　　ONCE through the forest

　　Alone I went;To seek for nothing

　　My thoughts were bent.

　　I saw i' the shadow

　　A flower stand thereAs stars it glisten'd,

　　As eyes 'twas fair.

　　I sought to pluck it,--

　　It gently said:"Shall I be gather'd

　　Only to fade?"

　　With all its roots

　　I dug it with care,And took it home

　　To my garden fair.

　　In silent corner

　　Soon it was set;There grows it ever,

　　There blooms it yet.

　　1815.*-----LIKE AND LIKE.

　　A FAIR bell-flower

　　Sprang tip from the ground;And early its fragrance

　　It shed all around;A bee came thither

　　And sipp'd from its bell;That they for each other

　　Were made, we see well.

　　1814.-----RECIPROCAL INVITATION TO THE DANCE.

　　THE INDIFFERENT.

　　COME to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!

　　Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.If thou my sweetheart art not, thou canst be so,

　　But if thou wilt not, we still will dance on.Come to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!

　　Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.

　　THE TENDER.

　　Loved one, without thee, what then would all feast be?

　　Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?If thou my sweetheart wert not, I would dance not.

　　If thou art still so, all life is one feast.Loved one, without thee, what then would all feasts be?

　　Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?

　　THE INDIFFERENT.

　　Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!

　　Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.Let us whirl round in the waltz's gay measure,

　　And let them steal to the dim-lighted wood.Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!

　　Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.

　　THE TENDER.

　　Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!

　　Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.Cupid, the near one, o'erhears their deriding,

　　Vengeance takes suddenly, vengeance takes soon.Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!

　　Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.

　　1789.*-----SELF-DECEIT.

　　My neighbour's curtain, well I see,

　　Is moving to and fin.No doubt she's list'ning eagerly,

　　If I'm at home or no.

　　And if the jealous grudge I bore

　　And openly confess'd,Is nourish'd by me as before,

　　Within my inmost breast.

　　Alas! no fancies such as these

　　E'er cross'd the dear child's thoughts.I see 'tis but the ev'ning breeze

　　That with the curtain sports.

　　1803.-----DECLARATION OF WAR.

　　OH, would I resembled

　　The country girls fair,Who rosy-red ribbons

　　And yellow hats wear!

　　To believe I was pretty

　　I thought was allow'd;In the town I believed it

　　When by the youth vow'd.

　　Now that Spring hath return'd,

　　All my joys disappear;The girls of the country

　　Have lured him from here.

　　To change dress and figure,

　　Was needful I found,My bodice is longer,

　　My petticoat round.

　　My hat now is yellow.

　　My bodice like snow;The clover to sickle

　　With others I go.

　　Something pretty, e'er long

　　Midst the troop he explores;The eager boy signs me

　　To go within doors.

　　I bashfully go,--

　　Who I am, he can't trace;He pinches my cheeks,

　　And he looks in my face.

　　The town girl now threatens

　　You maidens with war;Her twofold charms pledges .

　　Of victory are.

　　1803.-----LOVER IN ALL SHAPES.

　　To be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish;If thou cam'st with thy line.Thou wouldst soon make me thine.To be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish.

　　Oh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.Oh, were I a carFit to bear thee afar!Oh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.

　　I would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!If thou boughtest aught then,I'd return soon again.I would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!

　　I would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!To be faithful I'd swear,And would go away ne'er.I would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!

　　I would I were old,And wrinkled and cold,So that if thou said'st No,I could stand such a blow!I would I were old,And wrinkled and cold.

　　An ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee;If aught came to vex thee,I'd plague and perplex thee.An ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee

　　As a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave,As a lynx clearly see,As a fox cunning be.As a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave.

　　Whatever I were,All on thee I'd confer;With the gifts of a princeMy affection evince.Whatever I were,All on thee I'd confer.

　　As nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!If I'm not good enough,Thou must cut thine own stuff.As nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!

　　1815.*-----THE GOLDSMITH'S APPRENTICE.

　　My neighbour, none can e'er deny,

　　Is a most beauteous maid;Her shop is ever in mine eye,

　　When working at my trade.

　　To ring and chain I hammer then

　　The wire of gold assay'd,And think the while: "For Kate, oh when

　　Will such a ring be made?"

　　And when she takes her shutters down,

　　Her shop at once invade,To buy and haggle, all the town,

　　For all that's there displayd.

　　I file, and maybe overfile

　　The wire of gold assay'd;My master grumbles all the while,--

　　Her shop the mischief made.

　　To ply her wheel she straight begins,

　　When not engaged in trade;I know full well for what she spins,--

　　'Tis hope guides that dear maid.

　　Her leg, while her small foot treads on,

　　Is in my mind portray'd;Her garter I recall anon,--

　　I gave it that dear maid.

　　Then to her lips the finest thread

　　Is by her hand convey'd.Were I there only in its stead,

　　How I would kiss the maid!

　　1808.-----ANSWERS IN A GAME OF QUESTIONS.

　　THE LADY.

　　IN the small and great world too,

　　What most charms a woman's heart?It is doubtless what is new,

　　For its blossoms joy impart;Nobler far is what is true,

　　For fresh blossoms it can shoot

　　Even in the time of fruit.

　　THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN.

　　With the Nymphs in wood and cave

　　Paris was acquainted well,Till Zeus sent, to make him rave,

　　Three of those in Heav'n who dwell;And the choice more trouble gave

　　Than e'er fell to mortal lot,

　　Whether in old times or not.

　　THE EXPERIENCED.

　　Tenderly a woman view,

　　And thoult win her, take my word;He who's quick and saucy too,

　　Will of all men be preferr'd;Who ne'er seems as if he knew

　　If he pleases, if he charms,--

　　He 'tis injures, he 'tis harms.

　　THE CONTENTED.

　　Manifold is human strife,

　　Human passion, human pain;Many a blessing yet is rife,

　　Many pleasures still remain.Yet the greatest bliss in life,

　　And the richest prize we find,

　　Is a good, contented mind.

　　THE MERRY COUNSEL.

　　He by whom man's foolish will

　　Is each day review'd and blamed,Who, when others fools are still,

　　Is himself a fool proclaim'd,--Ne'er at mill was beast's back press'd

　　With a heavier load than he.What I feel within my breast

　　That in truth's the thing for me!

　　1789.-----DIFFERENT EMOTIONS ON THE SAME SPOT.

　　THE MAIDEN.

　　I'VE seen him before me!What rapture steals o'er me!

　　Oh heavenly sight!He's coming to meet me;Perplex'd, I retreat me,

　　With shame take to flight.My mind seems to wander!Ye rocks and trees yonder,

　　Conceal ye my rapture.

　　Conceal my delight!

　　THE YOUTH.

　　'Tis here I must find her,'Twas here she enshrined her,

　　Here vanish'd from sight.She came, as to meet me,Then fearing to greet me,

　　With shame took to flight.Is't hope? Do I wander?Ye rocks and trees yonder,

　　Disclose ye the loved one,

　　Disclose my delight!

　　THE LANGUISHING.

　　O'er my sad, fate I sorrow,To each dewy morrow,

　　Veil'd here from man's sightBy the many mistaken,Unknown and forsaken,

　　Here I wing my flight!Compassionate spirit!Let none ever hear it,--

　　Conceal my affliction,

　　Conceal thy delight!

　　THE HUNTER.

　　To-day I'm rewarded;Rich booty's afforded

　　By Fortune so bright.My servant the pheasants,And hares fit for presents

　　Takes homeward at night;Here see I enrapturedIn nets the birds captured!--

　　Long life to the hunter!

　　Long live his delight!

　　1789.-----WHO'LL BUY GODS OF LOVE?

　　OF all the beauteous waresExposed for sale at fairs,None will give more delightThan those that to your sightFrom distant lands we bring.Oh, hark to what we sing!These beauteous birds behold,They're brought here to be sold.

　　And first the big one see,So full of roguish glee!With light and merry boundHe leaps upon the ground;Then springs up on the bougd,We will not praise him now.The merry bird behold,--He's brought here to be sold.

　　And now the small one see!A modest look has he,And yet he's such apotherAs his big roguish brother.'Tis chiefly when all's stillHe loves to show his will.The bird so small and bold,--He's brought here to be sold.

　　Observe this little love,This darling turtle dove!All maidens are so neat,So civil, so discreetLet them their charms set loose,And turn your love to use;The gentle bird behold,--She's brought here to be sold.

　　Their praises we won't tell;They'll stand inspection well.They're fond of what is new,--And yet, to show they're true,Nor seal nor letter's wanted;To all have wings been granted.The pretty birds behold,--Such beauties ne'er were sold!

　　1795.-----THE MISANTHROPE.

　　AT first awhile sits he,

　　With calm, unruffled brow;His features then I see,Distorted hideously,--

　　An owl's they might be now.

　　What is it, askest thou?Is't love, or is't ennui?

　　'Tis both at once, I vow.

　　1767-9.-----DIFFERENT THREATS.

　　I ONCE into a forest far

　　My maiden went to seek,And fell upon her neck, when: "Ah!"

　　She threaten'd, "I will shriek!"

　　Then cried I haughtily: "I'll crush

　　The man that dares come near thee!""Hush!" whisper'd she: "My loved one, hush!

　　Or else they'll overhear thee!"

　　1767-9.-----MAIDEN WISHES.

　　WHAT pleasure to meA bridegroom would be!When married we are,They call us mamma.No need then to sew,To school we ne'er go;Command uncontroll'd,Have maids, whom to scold;Choose clothes at our ease,Of what tradesmen we please;Walk freely about,And go to each rout,And unrestrained areBy papa or mamma.

　　1767-9.-----MOTIVES.

　　IF to a girl who loves us trulyHer mother gives instruction dulyIn virtue, duty, and what not,--And if she hearkens ne'er a jot,But with fresh-strengthen'd longing flies

　　To meet our kiss that seems to burn,--

　　Caprice has just as much concernedAs love in her bold enterprise.

　　But if her mother can succeedIn gaining for her maxims heed,And softening the girl's heart too,So that she coyly shuns our view,--The heart of youth she knows but ill;

　　For when a maiden is thus stern,

　　Virtue in truth has less concernIn this, than an inconstant will.

　　1767-9.-----TRUE ENJOYMENT.

　　VAINLY wouldst thou, to gain a heart,

　　Heap up a maiden's lap with gold;The joys of love thou must impart,

　　Wouldst thou e'er see those joys unfold.The voices of the throng gold buys,

　　No single heart 'twill win for thee;Wouldst thou a maiden make thy prize,

　　Thyself alone the bribe must be.

　　If by no sacred tie thou'rt bound,

　　Oh youth, thou must thyself restrain!Well may true liberty be found,

　　Tho' man may seem to wear a chain.Let one alone inflame thee e'er,

　　And if her heart with love o'erflows,Let tenderness unite you there,

　　If duty's self no fetter knows.

　　First feel, oh youth! A girl then find

　　Worthy thy choice,--let her choose thee,In body fair, and fair in mind,

　　And then thou wilt be blessed, like me.I who have made this art mine own,

　　A girl have chosen such as thisThe blessing of the priest alone

　　Is wanting to complete our bliss.

　　Nought but my rapture is her guide,

　　Only for me she cares to please,--Ne'er wanton save when by my side,

　　And modest when the world she sees;That time our glow may never chill,

　　She yields no right through frailty;Her favour is a favour still,

　　And I must ever grateful be.

　　Yet I'm content, and full of joy,

　　If she'll but grant her smile so sweet,Or if at table she'll employ,

　　To pillow hers, her lover's feet,Give me the apple that she bit,

　　The glass from which she drank, bestow,And when my kiss so orders it,

　　Her bosom, veil'd till then, will show.

　　And when she wills of love to speak,

　　In fond and silent hours of bliss,Words from her mouth are all I seek,

　　Nought else I crave,--not e'en a kiss.With what a soul her mind is fraught,

　　Wreath'd round with charms unceasingly!She's perfect,--and she fails in nought

　　Save in her deigning to love me.

　　My rev'rence throws me at her feet,

　　My longing throws me on her breast;This, youth, is rapture true and sweet,

　　Be wise, thus seeking to be blest.When death shall take thee from her side,

　　To join the angelic choir above,In heaven's bright mansions to abide,--No diff'rence at the change thoult prove.

　　1767-8.-----THE FAREWELL.

　　[Probably addressed to his mistress Frederica.]

　　LET mine eye the farewell say,

　　That my lips can utter ne'er;Fain I'd be a man to-day,

　　Yet 'tis hard, oh, hard to bear!

　　Mournful in an hour like this

　　Is love's sweetest pledge, I ween;Cold upon thy mouth the kiss,

　　Faint thy fingers' pressure e'en.

　　Oh what rapture to my heart

　　Used each stolen kiss to bring!As the violets joy impart,

　　Gather'd in the early spring.

　　Now no garlands I entwine,

　　Now no roses pluck. for thee,Though 'tis springtime, Fanny mine,

　　Dreary autumn 'tis to me!

　　1771.-----THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

　　Now I leave this cottage lowly,

　　Where my love hath made her home,And with silent footstep slowly

　　Through the darksome forest roam,Luna breaks through oaks and bushes,

　　Zephyr hastes her steps to meet,And the waving birch-tree blushes,

　　Scattering round her incense sweet.

　　Grateful are the cooling breezes

　　Of this beauteous summer night,Here is felt the charm that pleases,

　　And that gives the soul delight.Boundless is my joy; yet, Heaven,

　　Willingly I'd leave to theeThousand such nights, were one given

　　By my maiden loved to me!

　　1767-8.-----HAPPINESS AND VISION.

　　TOGETHER at the altar weIn vision oft were seen by thee,

　　Thyself as bride, as bridegroom I.Oft from thy mouth full many a kissIn an unguarded hour of bliss

　　I then would steal, while none were by.

　　The purest rapture we then knew,The joy those happy hours gave too,

　　When tasted, fled, as time fleets on.What now avails my joy to me?Like dreams the warmest kisses flee,

　　Like kisses, soon all joys are gone.

　　1767-8.-----LIVING REMEMBRANCE.

　　HALF vex'd, half pleased, thy love will feel,Shouldst thou her knot or ribbon steal;To thee they're much--I won't conceal;

　　Such self-deceit may pardon'd be;A veil, a kerchief, garter, rings,In truth are no mean trifling things,

　　But still they're not enough for me.

　　She who is dearest to my heart,Gave me, with well dissembled smart,Of her own life, a living part,

　　No charm in aught beside I trace;How do I scorn thy paltry ware!A lock she gave me of the hair

　　That wantons o'er her beauteous face.

　　If, loved one, we must sever'd be,Wouldst thou not wholly fly from me,I still possess this legacy,

　　To look at, and to kiss in play.--My fate is to the hair's allied,We used to woo her with like pride,

　　And now we both are far away.

　　Her charms with equal joy we press'd,Her swelling cheeks anon caress'd,Lured onward by a yearning blest,

　　Upon her heaving bosom fell.Oh rival, free from envy's sway,Thou precious gift, thou beauteous prey.

　　Remain my joy and bliss to tell!

　　1767-9.-----THE BLISS OF ABSENCE.

　　DRINK, oh youth, joy's purest rayFrom thy loved one's eyes all day,

　　And her image paint at night!Better rule no lover knows,Yet true rapture greater grows,

　　When far sever'd from her sight.

　　Powers eternal, distance, time,Like the might of stars sublime,

　　Gently rock the blood to rest,O'er my senses softness steals,Yet my bosom lighter feels,

　　And I daily am more blest.

　　Though I can forget her ne'er,Yet my mind is free from care,

　　I can calmly live and move;Unperceived infatuationLonging turns to adoration,

　　Turns to reverence my love.

　　Ne'er can cloud, however light,Float in ether's regions bright,

　　When drawn upwards by the sun,As my heart in rapturous calm.Free from envy and alarm,

　　Ever love I her alone!

　　1767-9.-----TO LUNA.

　　SISTER of the first-born light,

　　Type of sorrowing gentleness!

　　Quivering mists in silv'ry dressFloat around thy features bright;When thy gentle foot is heard,

　　From the day-closed caverns then

　　Wake the mournful ghosts of men,I, too, wake, and each night-bird.

　　O'er a field of boundless span

　　Looks thy gaze both far and wide.

　　Raise me upwards to thy side!Grant this to a raving man!And to heights of rapture raised,

　　Let the knight so crafty peep

　　At his maiden while asleep,Through her lattice-window glazed.

　　Soon the bliss of this sweet view,

　　Pangs by distance caused allays;

　　And I gather all thy rays,And my look I sharpen too.Round her unveil'd limbs I see

　　Brighter still become the glow,

　　And she draws me down below,As Endymion once drew thee.

　　1767-9.-----THE WEDDING NIGHT.

　　WITHIN the chamber, far away

　　From the glad feast, sits Love in dreadLest guests disturb, in wanton play,

　　The silence of the bridal bed.His torch's pale flame serves to gild

　　The scene with mystic sacred glow;The room with incense-clouds is fil'd,

　　That ye may perfect rapture know.

　　How beats thy heart, when thou dost hear

　　The chime that warns thy guests to fly!How glow'st thou for those lips so dear,

　　That soon are mute, and nought deny!With her into the holy place

　　Thou hast'nest then, to perfect all;The fire the warder's hands embrace,

　　Grows, like a night-light, dim and small.

　　How heaves her bosom, and how burns

　　Her face at every fervent kiss!Her coldness now to trembling turns,

　　Thy daring now a duty is.Love helps thee to undress her fast,

　　But thou art twice as fast as he;And then he shuts both eye at last,

　　With sly and roguish modesty.

　　1767.-----MISCHIEVOUS JOY.

　　AS a butterfly renew'd,

　　When in life I breath'd my last,

　　To the spots my flight I wing,

　　Scenes of heav'nly rapture past,

　　Over meadows, to the spring,Round the hill, and through the wood.

　　Soon a tender pair I spy,

　　And I look down from my seat

　　On the beauteous maiden's head--

　　When embodied there I meet

　　All I lost as soon as dead,Happy as before am I.

　　Him she clasps with silent smile,

　　And his mouth the hour improves,

　　Sent by kindly Deities;

　　First from breast to mouth it roves,

　　Then from mouth to hands it flies,And I round him sport the while.

　　And she sees me hov'ring near;

　　Trembling at her lovers rapture,

　　Up she springs--I fly away,

　　"Dearest! let's the insect capture

　　Come! I long to make my preyYonder pretty little dear!"

　　1767-9.-----APPARENT DEATH.

　　WEEP, maiden, weep here o'er the tomb of Love;

　　He died of nothing--by mere chance was slain.But is he really dead?--oh, that I cannot prove:

　　A nothing, a mere chance, oft gives him life again.

　　1767-9.-----NOVEMBER SONG.

　　To the great archer--not to him

　　To meet whom flies the sun,And who is wont his features dim

　　With clouds to overrun--

　　But to the boy be vow'd these rhymes,

　　Who 'mongst the roses plays,Who hear us, and at proper times

　　To pierce fair hearts essays.

　　Through him the gloomy winter night,

　　Of yore so cold and drear,Brings many a loved friend to our sight,

　　And many a woman dear.

　　Henceforward shall his image fair

　　Stand in yon starry skies,And, ever mild and gracious there,

　　Alternate set and rise.

　　1815.*-----TO THE CHOSEN ONE.[This sweet song is doubtless one of those addressed toFrederica.]

　　HAND in hand! and lip to lip!

　　Oh, be faithful, maiden dear!Fare thee well! thy lover's ship

　　Past full many a rock must steersBut should he the haven see,

　　When the storm has ceased to break,And be happy, reft of thee,--

　　May the Gods fierce vengeance take!

　　Boldly dared is well nigh won!

　　Half my task is solved aright;Ev'ry star's to me a sun,

　　Only cowards deem it night.Stood I idly by thy side,

　　Sorrow still would sadden me;But when seas our paths divide,

　　Gladly toil I,--toil for thee!

　　Now the valley I perceive,

　　Where together we will go,And the streamlet watch each eve,

　　Gliding peacefully belowOh, the poplars on yon spot!

　　Oh, the beech trees in yon grove!And behind we'll build a cot,

　　Where to taste the joys of love!

　　1771.-----FIRST LOSS.

　　AH! who'll e'er those days restore,

　　Those bright days of early loveWho'll one hour again concede,

　　Of that time so fondly cherish'd!Silently my wounds I feed,And with wailing evermore

　　Sorrow o'er each joy now perish'd.Ah! who'll e'er the days restore

　　Of that time so fondly cherish'd.

　　1789.*-----AFTER-SENSATIONS.

　　WHEN the vine again is blowing,

　　Then the wine moves in the cask;When the rose again is glowing,

　　Wherefore should I feel oppress'd?

　　Down my cheeks run tears all-burning,

　　If I do, or leave my task;I but feel a speechless yearning,

　　That pervades my inmost breast.

　　But at length I see the reason,

　　When the question I would ask:'Twas in such a beauteous season,

　　Doris glowed to make me blest!

　　1797.-----PROXIMITY OF THE BELOVED ONE.

　　I THINK of thee, whene'er the sun his beams

　　O'er ocean flings;I think  of thee, whene'er the moonlight gleams

　　In silv'ry springs.

　　I see thee, when upon the distant ridge

　　The dust awakes;At midnight's hour, when on the fragile bridge

　　The wanderer quakes.

　　I hear thee, when yon billows rise on high,

　　With murmur deep.To tread the silent grove oft wander I,

　　When all's asleep.

　　I'm near thee, though thou far away mayst be--

　　Thou, too, art near!The sun then sets, the stars soon lighten me.

　　Would thou wert here!

　　1795.-----PRESENCE.

　　ALL things give token of thee!As soon as the bright sun is shining,Thou too wilt follow, I trust.

　　When in the garden thou walk'st,Thou then art the rose of all roses,Lily of lilies as well.

　　When thou dost move in the dance,Then each constellation moves also;With thee and round thee they move.

　　Night! oh, what bliss were the night!For then thou o'ershadow'st the lustre,Dazzling and fair, of the moon.

　　Dazzling and beauteous art thou,And flowers, and moon, and the planetsHomage pay, Sun, but to thee.

　　Sun! to me also be thouCreator of days bright and glorious;Life and Eternity this!

　　1813.-----TO THE DISTANT ONE.

　　AND have I lost thee evermore?

　　Hast thou, oh fair one, from me flown?Still in mine ear sounds, as of yore,

　　Thine ev'ry word, thine ev'ry tone.

　　As when at morn the wand'rer's eye

　　Attempts to pierce the air in vain,When, hidden in the azure sky,

　　The lark high o'er him chaunts his strain:

　　So do I cast my troubled gaze

　　Through bush, through forest, o'er the lea;Thou art invoked by all my lays;

　　Oh, come then, loved one, back to me!

　　1789.*-----BY THE RIVER.

　　FLOW on, ye lays so loved, so fair,

　　On to Oblivion's ocean flow!May no rapt boy recall you e'er,

　　No maiden in her beauty's glow!

　　My love alone was then your theme,

　　But now she scorns my passion true.Ye were but written in the stream;

　　As it flows on, then, flow ye too!

　　1798.*-----FAREWELL.

　　To break one's word is pleasure-fraught,

　　To do one's duty gives a smart;While man, alas! will promise nought,

　　That is repugnant to his heart.

　　Using some magic strains of yore,

　　Thou lurest him, when scarcely calm,On to sweet folly's fragile bark once more,

　　Renewing, doubling chance of harm.

　　Why seek to hide thyself from me?

　　Fly not my sight--be open then!Known late or early it must be,

　　And here thou hast thy word again.

　　My duty is fulfill'd to-day,

　　No longer will I guard thee from surprise;But, oh, forgive the friend who from thee turns away,

　　And to himself for refuge flies!

　　1797.-----THE EXCHANGE.

　　THE stones in the streamlet I make my bright pillow,And open my arms to the swift-rolling billow,

　　That lovingly hastens to fall on my breast.Then fickleness soon bids it onwards be flowing;A second draws nigh, its caresses bestowing,--

　　And so by a twofold enjoyment I'm blest.

　　And yet thou art trailing in sorrow and sadnessThe moments that life, as it flies, gave for gladness,

　　Because by thy love thou'rt remember'd no more!Oh, call back to mind former days and their blisses!The lips of the second will give as sweet kisses

　　As any the lips of the first gave before!

　　1767-9.-----WELCOME AND FAREWELL.

　　[Another of the love-songs addressed to Frederica.]

　　QUICK throbb'd my heart: to norse! haste, haste,

　　And lo! 'twas done with speed of light;The evening soon the world embraced,

　　And o'er the mountains hung the night.Soon stood, in robe of mist, the oak,

　　A tow'ring giant in his size,Where darkness through the thicket broke,

　　And glared with hundred gloomy eyes.

　　From out a hill of clouds the moon

　　With mournful gaze began to peer:The winds their soft wings flutter'd soon,

　　And murmur'd in mine awe-struck ear;The night a thousand monsters made,

　　Yet fresh and joyous was my mind;What fire within my veins then play'd!

　　What glow was in my bosom shrin'd!

　　I saw thee, and with tender pride

　　Felt thy sweet gaze pour joy on me;While all my heart was at thy side.

　　And every breath I breath'd for thee.The roseate hues that spring supplies

　　Were playing round thy features fair,And love for me--ye Deities!

　　I hoped it, I deserved it ne'er!

　　But, when the morning sun return'd,

　　Departure filled with grief my heart:Within thy kiss, what rapture burn'd!

　　But in thy look, what bitter smart!I went--thy gaze to earth first roved

　　Thou follow'dst me with tearful eye:And yet, what rapture to be loved!

　　And, Gods, to love--what ecstasy!

　　1771.-----NEW LOVE, NEW LIFE.

　　[Written at the time of Goethe's connection with Lily.]

　　HEART! my heart! what means this feeling?

　　What oppresseth thee so sore?What strange life is o'er me stealing!

　　I acknowledge thee no more.Fled is all that gave thee gladness,Fled the cause of all thy sadness,

　　Fled thy peace, thine industry--

　　Ah, why suffer it to be?

　　Say, do beauty's graces youthful,

　　Does this form so fair and bright,Does this gaze, so kind, so truthful,

　　Chain thee with unceasing might?Would I tear me from her boldly,Courage take, and fly her coldly,

　　Back to her. I'm forthwith led

　　By the path I seek to tread.

　　By a thread I ne'er can sever,

　　For 'tis 'twined with magic skill,Doth the cruel maid for ever

　　Hold me fast against my will.While those magic chains confine me,To her will I must resign me.

　　Ah, the change in truth is great!

　　Love! kind love! release me straight!

　　1775.-----TO BELINDA.

　　[This song was also written for Lily. Goethe mentions, at the endof his Autobiography, that he overheard her singing it oneevening after he had taken his last farewell of her.]

　　WHEREFORE drag me to yon glittering eddy,

　　With resistless might?Was I, then, not truly blest already

　　In the silent night?

　　In my secret chamber refuge taking,

　　'Neath the moon's soft ray,And her awful light around me breaking,

　　Musing there I lay.

　　And I dream'd of hours with joy o'erflowing,

　　Golden, truly blest,While thine image so beloved was glowing

　　Deep within my breast.

　　Now to the card-table hast thou bound me,

　　'Midst the torches glare?Whilst unhappy faces are around me,

　　Dost thou hold me there?

　　Spring-flow'rs are to me more rapture-giving,

　　Now conceal'd from view;Where thou, angel, art, is Nature living,

　　Love and kindness too.

　　1775.-----MAY SONG.

　　How fair doth Nature

　　Appear again!How bright the sunbeams!

　　How smiles the plain!

　　The flow'rs are bursting

　　From ev'ry bough,And thousand voices

　　Each bush yields now.

　　And joy and gladness

　　Fill ev'ry breast!Oh earth!--oh sunlight!

　　Oh rapture blest!

　　Oh love! oh loved one!

　　As golden bright,As clouds of morning

　　On yonder height!

　　Thou blessest gladly

　　The smiling field,--The world in fragrant

　　Vapour conceal'd.

　　Oh maiden, maiden,

　　How love I thee!Thine eye, how gleams it!

　　How lov'st thou me!

　　The blithe lark loveth

　　Sweet song and air,The morning flow'ret

　　Heav'n's incense fair,

　　As I now love thee

　　With fond desire,For thou dost give me

　　Youth, joy, and fire,

　　For new-born dances

　　And minstrelsy.Be ever happy,

　　As thou lov'st me!

　　1775.*-----WITH A PAINTED RIBBON.

　　LITTLE leaves and flow'rets too,

　　Scatter we with gentle hand,Kind young spring-gods to the view,

　　Sporting on an airy band.

　　Zephyr, bear it on the wing,

　　Twine it round my loved one's dress;To her glass then let her spring,

　　Full of eager joyousness.

　　Roses round her let her see,

　　She herself a youthful rose.Grant, dear life, one look to me!

　　'Twill repay me all my woes,

　　What this bosom feels, feel thou.

　　Freely offer me thy hand;Let the band that joins us now

　　Be no fragile rosy band!

　　1770.-----WITH A GOLDEN NECKLACE.

　　THIS page a chain to bring thee burns,

　　That, train'd to suppleness of old,On thy fair neck to nestle, yearns,

　　In many a hundred little fold.

　　To please the silly thing consent!

　　'Tis harmless, and from boldness free;By day a trifling ornament,

　　At night 'tis cast aside by thee.

　　But if the chain they bring thee ever,

　　Heavier, more fraught with weal or woe,I'd then, Lisette, reproach thee never

　　If thou shouldst greater scruples show.

　　1775.*-----ON THE LAKE,

　　[Written on the occasion of Goethe's starting with his friendPassavant on a Swiss Tour.]

　　I DRINK fresh nourishment, new blood

　　From out this world more free;The Nature is so kind and good

　　That to her breast clasps me!The billows toss our bark on high,

　　And with our oars keep time,While cloudy mountains tow'rd the sky

　　Before our progress climb.

　　Say, mine eye, why sink'st thou down?Golden visions, are ye flown?

　　Hence, thou dream, tho' golden-twin'd;

　　Here, too, love and life I find.

　　Over the waters are blinking

　　Many a thousand fair star;Gentle mists are drinking

　　Round the horizon afar.Round the shady creek lightly

　　Morning zephyrs awake,And the ripen'd fruit brightly

　　Mirrors itself in the lake.

　　1775.-----FROM THE MOUNTAIN.

　　[Written just after the preceding one, on a mountain overlookingthe Lake of Zurich.]

　　IF I, dearest Lily, did not love thee,

　　How this prospect would enchant my sight!And yet if I, Lily, did not love thee,

　　Could I find, or here, or there, delight?

　　1775.-----FLOWER-SALUTE.

　　THIS nosegay,--'twas I dress'd it,--

　　Greets thee a thousand times!Oft stoop'd I, and caress'd it,

　　Ah! full a thousand times,And 'gainst my bosom press'd it

　　A hundred thousand times!

　　1815.*-----IN SUMMER.

　　How plain and heightWith dewdrops are bright!How pearls have crown'dThe plants all around!How sighs the breezeThro' thicket and trees!How loudly in the sun's clear raysThe sweet birds carol forth their lays!

　　But, ah! above,Where saw I my love,Within her room,Small, mantled in gloom,Enclosed around,Where sunlight was drown'd,How little there was earth to me,With all its beauteous majesty!

　　1776.*-----MAY SONG.

　　BETWEEN wheatfield and corn,Between hedgerow and thorn,Between pasture and tree,Where's my sweetheartTell it me!

　　Sweetheart caught I

　　Not at home;She's then, thought I.

　　Gone to roam.Fair and loving

　　Blooms sweet May;Sweetheart's roving,

　　Free and gay.

　　By the rock near the wave,Where her first kiss she gave,On the greensward, to me,--Something I see!Is it she?

　　1812.-----PREMATURE SPRING.

　　DAYS full of rapture,

　　Are ye renew'd ?--Smile in the sunlight

　　Mountain and wood?

　　Streams richer laden

　　Flow through the dale,Are these the meadows?

　　Is this the vale?

　　Coolness cerulean!

　　Heaven and height!Fish crowd the ocean,

　　Golden and bright.

　　Birds of gay plumage

　　Sport in the grove,Heavenly numbers

　　Singing above.

　　Under the verdure's

　　Vigorous bloom,Bees, softly bumming,

　　Juices consume.

　　Gentle disturbance

　　Quivers in air,Sleep-causing fragrance,

　　Motion so fair.

　　Soon with more power

　　Rises the breeze,Then in a moment

　　Dies in the trees.

　　But to the bosom

　　Comes it again.Aid me, ye Muses,

　　Bliss to sustain!

　　Say what has happen'd

　　Since yester e'en?Oh, ye fair sisters,

　　Her I have seen!

　　1802.-----AUTUMN FEELINGS.

　　FLOURISH greener, as ye clamber,Oh ye leaves, to seek my chamber,

　　Up the trellis'd vine on high!May ye swell, twin-berries tender,Juicier far,--and with more splendour

　　Ripen, and more speedily!O'er ye broods the sun at evenAs he sinks to rest, and heaven

　　Softly breathes into your earAll its fertilising fullness,While the moon's refreshing coolness,

　　Magic-laden, hovers near;And, alas! ye're watered ever

　　By a stream of tears that rillFrom mine eyes--tears ceasing never,

　　Tears of love that nought can still!

　　1775.*-----RESTLESS LOVE.

　　THROUGH rain, through snow,Through tempest go!'Mongst streaming caves,O'er misty waves,On, on! still on!Peace, rest have flown!

　　Sooner through sadness

　　I'd wish to be slain,Than all the gladness

　　Of life to sustainAll the fond yearning

　　That heart feels for heart,Only seems burning

　　To make them both smart.

　　How shall I fly?Forestwards hie?Vain were all strife!Bright crown of life.Turbulent bliss,--Love, thou art this!

　　1789.-----THE SHEPHERD'S LAMENT.

　　ON yonder lofty mountain

　　A thousand times I stand,And on my staff reclining,

　　Look down on the smiling land.

　　My grazing flocks then I follow,

　　My dog protecting them well;I find myself in the valley,

　　But how, I scarcely can tell.

　　The whole of the meadow is cover'd

　　With flowers of beauty rare;I pluck them, but pluck them unknowing

　　To whom the offering to bear.

　　In rain and storm and tempest,

　　I tarry beneath the tree,But closed remaineth yon portal;

　　'Tis all but a vision to me.

　　High over yonder dwelling,

　　There rises a rainbow gay;But she from home hath departed

　　And wander'd far, far away.

　　Yes, far away bath she wander'd,

　　Perchance e'en over the sea;Move onward, ye sheep, then, move onward!

　　Full sad the shepherd must be.

　　1803.*-----COMFORT IN TEARS.

　　How happens it that thou art sad,

　　While happy all appear?Thine eye proclaims too well that thou

　　Hast wept full many a tear.

　　"If I have wept in solitude,

　　None other shares my grief,And tears to me sweet balsam are,

　　And give my heart relief."

　　Thy happy friends invite thee now,--

　　Oh come, then, to our breast!And let the loss thou hast sustain'd

　　Be there to us confess'd!

　　"Ye shout, torment me, knowing not

　　What 'tis afflicteth me;Ah no! I have sustained no loss,

　　Whate'er may wanting be."

　　If so it is, arise in haste!

　　Thou'rt young and full of life.At years like thine, man's blest with strength.

　　And courage for the strife.

　　"Ah no! in vain 'twould be to strive,

　　The thing I seek is far;It dwells as high, it gleams as fair

　　As yonder glitt'ring star."

　　The stars we never long to clasp,

　　We revel in their light,And with enchantment upward gaze,

　　Each clear and radiant night.

　　"And I with rapture upward gaze,

　　On many a blissful day;Then let me pass the night in tears,

　　Till tears are wip'd away!

　　1803.*-----NIGHT SONG,

　　WHEN on thy pillow lying,

　　Half listen, I implore,And at my lute's soft sighing,

　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

　　For at my lute's soft sighing

　　The stars their blessings pourOn feelings never-dying;

　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

　　Those feelings never-dying

　　My spirit aid to soarFrom earthly conflicts trying;

　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

　　From earthly conflicts trying

　　Thou driv'st me to this shore;Through thee I'm thither flying,--

　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

　　Through thee I'm hither flying,

　　Thou wilt not list beforeIn slumbers thou art lying:

　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

　　1803.*-----LONGING.

　　WHAT pulls at my heart so?

　　What tells me to roam?What drags me and lures me

　　From chamber and home?How round the cliffs gather

　　The clouds high in air!I fain would go thither,

　　I fain would be there!

　　The sociable flight

　　Of the ravens comes back;I mingle amongst them,

　　And follow their track.Round wall and round mountain

　　Together we fly;She tarries below there,

　　I after her spy.

　　Then onward she wanders,

　　My flight I wing soonTo the wood fill'd with bushes,

　　A bird of sweet tune.She tarries and hearkens,

　　And smiling, thinks she:"How sweetly he's singing!

　　He's singing to me!"

　　The heights are illum'd

　　By the fast setting sun;The pensive fair maiden

　　Looks thoughtfully on;She roams by the streamlet,

　　O'er meadows she goes,And darker and darker

　　The pathway fast grows.

　　I rise on a sudden,

　　A glimmering star;"What glitters above me,

　　So near and so far?"

　　And when thou with wonder

　　Hast gazed on the light,I fall down before thee,

　　Entranced by thy sight!

　　1803.-----TO MIGNON.

　　OVER vale and torrent farRolls along the sun's bright car.Ah! he wakens in his course

　　Mine, as thy deep-seated smart

　　In the heart.Ev'ry morning with new force.

　　Scarce avails night aught to me;E'en the visions that I seeCome but in a mournful guise;

　　And I feel this silent smart

　　In my heartWith creative pow'r arise.

　　During many a beauteous yearI have seen ships 'neath me steer,As they seek the shelt'ring bay;

　　But, alas, each lasting smart

　　In my heartFloats not with the stream away.

　　I must wear a gala dress,Long stored up within my press,For to-day to feasts is given;

　　None know with what bitter smart

　　Is my heartFearfully and madly riven.

　　Secretly I weep each tear,Yet can cheerful e'en appear,With a face of healthy red;

　　For if deadly were this silent smart

　　In my heart,Ah, I then had long been dead!-----THE MOUNTAIN CASTLE.

　　THERE stands on yonder high mountain

　　A castle built of yore,Where once lurked horse and horseman

　　In rear of gate and of door.

　　Now door and gate are in ashes,

　　And all around is so still;And over the fallen ruins

　　I clamber just as I will.

　　Below once lay a cellar,

　　With costly wines well stor'd;No more the glad maid with her pitcher

　　Descends there to draw from the hoard.

　　No longer the goblet she places

　　Before the guests at the feast;The flask at the meal so hallow'd

　　No longer she fills for the priest.

　　No more for the eager squire

　　The draught in the passage is pour'd;No more for the flying present

　　Receives she the flying reward.

　　For all the roof and the rafters,

　　They all long since have been burn'd,And stairs and passage and chapel

　　To rubbish and ruins are turn'd.

　　Yet when with lute and with flagon,

　　When day was smiling and bright,I've watch'd my mistress climbing

　　To gain this perilous height,

　　Then rapture joyous and radiant

　　The silence so desolate brake,And all, as in days long vanish'd,

　　Once more to enjoyment awoke;

　　As if for guests of high station

　　The largest rooms were prepared;As if from those times so precious

　　A couple thither had fared;

　　As if there stood in his chapel

　　The priest in his sacred dress,And ask'd: "Would ye twain be united?"

　　And we, with a smile, answer'd, "Yes!"

　　And songs that breath'd a deep feeling,

　　That touched the heart's innermost chord,The music-fraught mouth of sweet echo,

　　Instead of the many, outpour'd.

　　And when at eve all was hidden

　　In silence unbroken and deep,The glowing sun then look'd upwards,

　　And gazed on the summit so steep.

　　And squire and maiden then glitter'd

　　As bright and gay as a lord,She seized the time for her present,

　　And he to give her reward.

　　1803.*-----THE SPIRIT'S SALUTE.

　　THE hero's noble shade stands high

　　On yonder turret grey;And as the ship is sailing by,

　　He speeds it on his way.

　　"See with what strength these sinews thrill'd!

　　This heart, how firm and wild!These bones, what knightly marrow fill'd!

　　This cup, how bright it smil'd!

　　"Half of my life I strove and fought,

　　And half I calmly pass'd;And thou, oh ship with beings fraught,

　　Sail safely to the last!"

　　1774.-----TO A GOLDEN HEART THAT HE WORE ROUND HIS NECK.

　　[Addressed, during the Swiss tour already mentioned, to a presentLily had given him, during the time of their happy connection,which was then about to be terminated for ever.]

　　OH thou token loved of joys now perish'd

　　That I still wear from my neck suspended,Art thou stronger than our spirit-bond so cherish'd?

　　Or canst thou prolong love's days untimely ended?

　　Lily, I fly from thee! I still am doom'd to rangeThro' countries strange,

　　Thro' distant vales and woods, link'd on to thee!Ah, Lily's heart could surely never fall

　　So soon away from me!

　　As when a bird bath broken from his thrall,

　　And seeks the forest green,Proof of imprisonment he bears behind him,A morsel of the thread once used to bind him;

　　The free-born bird of old no more is seen,

　　For he another's prey bath been.

　　1775.-----THE BLISS OF SORROW.

　　NEVER dry, never dry,

　　Tears that eternal love sheddeth!How dreary, how dead doth the world still appear,When only half-dried on the eye is the tear!

　　Never dry, never dry,

　　Tears that unhappy love sheddeth!

　　1789.*-----THE WANDERER'S NIGHT-SONG.

　　THOU who comest from on high,

　　Who all woes and sorrows stillest,Who, for twofold misery,

　　Hearts with twofold balsam fillest,Would this constant strife would cease!

　　What are pain and rapture now?Blissful Peace,

　　To my bosom hasten thou!

　　1789.*-----THE SAME.

　　[Written at night on the Kickelhahn, a hill in the forest ofIlmenau, on the walls of a little hermitage where Goethe composedthe last act of his Iphigenia.]

　　HUSH'D on the hill

　　Is the breeze;

　　Scarce by the zephyr

　　The trees

　　Softly are press'd;The woodbird's asleep on the bough.Wait, then, and thou

　　Soon wilt find rest.

　　1783.-----THE HUNTER'S EVEN-SONG.

　　THE plain with still and wand'ring feet,

　　And gun full-charged, I tread,And hov'ring see thine image sweet,

　　Thine image dear, o'er head.

　　In gentle silence thou dost fare

　　Through field and valley dear;But doth my fleeting image ne'er

　　To thy mind's eye appear?

　　His image, who, by grief oppress'd,

　　Roams through the world forlorn,And wanders on from east to west,

　　Because from thee he's torn?

　　When I would think of none but thee,

　　Mine eyes the moon survey;A calm repose then steals o'er me,

　　But how, 'twere hard to say.

　　1776,*-----TO THE MOON.

　　BUSH and vale thou fill'st again

　　With thy misty ray,And my spirit's heavy chain

　　Castest far away.

　　Thou dost o'er my fields extend

　　Thy sweet soothing eye,Watching like a gentle friend,

　　O'er my destiny.

　　Vanish'd days of bliss and woe

　　Haunt me with their tone,Joy and grief in turns I know,

　　As I stray alone.

　　Stream beloved, flow on! flow on!

　　Ne'er can I be gay!Thus have sport and kisses gone,

　　Truth thus pass'd away.

　　Once I seem'd the lord to be

　　Of that prize so fair!Now, to our deep sorrow, we

　　Can forget it ne'er.

　　Murmur, stream, the vale along,

　　Never cease thy sighs;Murmur, whisper to my song

　　Answering melodies!

　　When thou in the winter's night

　　Overflow'st in wrath,Or in spring-time sparklest bright,

　　As the buds shoot forth.

　　He who from the world retires,

　　Void of hate, is blest;Who a friend's true love inspires,

　　Leaning on his breast!

　　That which heedless man ne'er knew,

　　Or ne'er thought aright,Roams the bosom's labyrinth through,

　　Boldly into night.

　　1789.*-----TO LINA.

　　SHOULD these songs, love, as they fleet,

　　Chance again to reach thy hand,At the piano take thy seat,

　　Where thy friend was wont to stand!

　　Sweep with finger bold the string,

　　Then the book one moment see:But read not! do nought but sing!

　　And each page thine own will be!

　　Ah, what grief the song imparts

　　With its letters, black on white,That, when breath'd by thee, our hearts

　　Now can break and now delight!

　　1800.*-----EVER AND EVERYWHERE.

　　FAR explore the mountain hollow,High in air the clouds then follow!

　　To each brook and vale the Muse

　　Thousand times her call renews.

　　Soon as a flow'ret blooms in spring,It wakens many a strain;

　　And when Time spreads his fleeting wing,

　　The seasons come again.

　　1820.*-----PETITION.

　　OH thou sweet maiden fair,Thou with the raven hair,

　　Why to the window go?

　　While gazing down below,Art standing vainly there?

　　Oh, if thou stood'st for me,And lett'st the latch but fly,

　　How happy should I be!How soon would I leap high!

　　1789.*-----TO HIS COY ONE.

　　SEEST thou yon smiling Orange?Upon the tree still hangs it;Already March bath vanish'd,And new-born flow'rs are shooting.I draw nigh to the tree then,And there I say: Oh Orange,Thou ripe and juicy Orange,Thou sweet and luscious Orange,I shake the tree, I shake it,Oh fall into my lap!

　　1789.*-----NIGHT THOUGHTS.

　　OH, unhappy stars! your fate I mourn,

　　Ye by whom the sea-toss'd sailor's lighted,Who with radiant beams the heav'ns adorn,

　　But by gods and men are unrequited:For ye love not,--ne'er have learnt to love!Ceaselessly in endless dance ye move,In the spacious sky your charms displaying,

　　What far travels ye have hasten'd through,Since, within my loved one's arms delaying,

　　I've forgotten you and midnight too!

　　1789.*-----TO LIDA.

　　THE only one whom, Lida, thou canst love,

　　Thou claim'st, and rightly claim'st, for only thee;He too is wholly thine; since doomed to rove

　　Far from thee, in life's turmoils nought I seeSave a thin veil, through which thy form I view,As though in clouds; with kindly smile and true,

　　It cheers me, like the stars eterne that gleamAcross the northern-lights' far-flick'ring beam.

　　1789.*-----PROXIMITY.

　　I KNOW not, wherefore, dearest love,

　　Thou often art so strange and coyWhen 'mongst man's busy haunts we move,

　　Thy coldness puts to flight my joy.But soon as night and silence round us reign,I know thee by thy kisses sweet again!

　　1789.*-----RECIPROCAL.

　　MY mistress, where sits she?

　　What is it that charms?The absent she's rocking,

　　Held fast in her arms.

　　In pretty cage prison'd

　　She holds a bird still;Yet lets him fly from her,

　　Whenever he will.

　　He pecks at her finger,

　　And pecks at her lips,And hovers and flutters,

　　And round her he skips.

　　Then hasten thou homeward,

　　In fashion to be;If thou hast the maiden,

　　She also hath thee.

　　1816.-----ROLLICKING HANS.

　　HALLO there! A glass!

　　Ha! the draught's truly sweet!If for drink go my shoes,

　　I shall still have my feet.

　　A maiden and wine,

　　With sweet music and song,--I would they were mine,

　　All life's journey along!

　　If I depart from this sad sphere,And leave a will behind me here,A suit at law will be preferr'd,But as for thanks,--the deuce a word!So ere I die, I squander all,And that a proper will I call.

　　HIS COMRADE.

　　Hallo there! A glass!

　　Ha! the draught's truly sweetIf thou keepest thy shoes,

　　Thou wilt then spare thy feet.

　　A maiden and wine,

　　With sweet music and song,On pavement, are thine,

　　All life's journey along!-----THE FREEBOOTER,

　　No door has my house,

　　No house has my door;And in and out ever

　　I carry my store.

　　No grate has my kitchen,

　　No kitchen my grate;Yet roasts it and boils it

　　Both early and late.

　　My bed has no trestles,

　　My trestles no bed;Yet merrier moments

　　No mortal e'er led.

　　My cellar is lofty,

　　My barn is full deep,From top to the bottom,--

　　There lie I and sleep.

　　And soon as I waken,

　　All moves on its race;My place has no fixture,

　　My fixture no place.

　　1827.*-----JOY AND SORROW.

　　As a fisher-boy I fared

　　To the black rock in the sea,And, while false gifts I prepared.

　　Listen'd and sang merrily,Down descended the decoy,

　　Soon a fish attack'd the bait;One exultant shout of joy,--

　　And the fish was captured straight.

　　Ah! on shore, and to the wood

　　Past the cliffs, o'er stock and stone,One foot's traces I pursued,

　　And the maiden was alone.Lips were silent, eyes downcast

　　As a clasp-knife snaps the bait,With her snare she seized me fast,

　　And the boy was captured straight.

　　Heav'n knows who's the happy swain

　　That she rambles with anew!I must dare the sea again,

　　Spite of wind and weather too.When the great and little fish

　　Wail and flounder in my net,Straight returns my eager wish

　　In her arms to revel yet!

　　1815.-----MARCH.

　　THE snow-flakes fall in showers,

　　The time is absent still,When all Spring's beauteous flowers,When all Spring's beauteous flowers

　　Our hearts with joy shall fill.

　　With lustre false and fleeting

　　The sun's bright rays are thrown;The swallow's self is cheating:The swallow's self is cheating,

　　And why? He comes alone!

　　Can I e'er feel delighted

　　Alone, though Spring is near?Yet when we are united,Yet when we are united,

　　The Summer will be here.

　　1817.-----APRIL.

　　TELL me, eyes, what 'tis ye're seeking;

　　For ye're saying something sweet,

　　Fit the ravish'd ear to greet,Eloquently, softly speaking.

　　Yet I see now why ye're roving;

　　For behind those eyes so bright,

　　To itself abandon'd quite,Lies a bosom, truthful, loving,--

　　One that it must fill with pleasure

　　'Mongst so many, dull and blind,

　　One true look at length to find,That its worth can rightly treasure.

　　Whilst I'm lost in studying ever

　　To explain these cyphers duly,--

　　To unravel my looks trulyIn return be your endeavour!

　　1820.-----MAY.

　　LIGHT and silv'ry cloudlets hover

　　In the air, as yet scarce warm;Mild, with glimmer soft tinged over,

　　Peeps the sun through fragrant balm.Gently rolls and heaves the ocean

　　As its waves the bank o'erflow.And with ever restless motion

　　Moves the verdure to and fro,

　　Mirror'd brightly far below.

　　What is now the foliage moving?

　　Air is still, and hush'd the breeze,Sultriness, this fullness loving,

　　Through the thicket, from the trees.Now the eye at once gleams brightly,

　　See! the infant band with mirthMoves and dances nimbly, lightly,

　　As the morning gave it birth,

　　Flutt'ring two and two o'er earth.

　　*      *      *      *

　　1816.-----JUNE.

　　SHE behind yon mountain lives,Who my love's sweet guerdon gives.Tell me, mount, how this can be!Very glass thou seem'st to me,And I seem to be close by,For I see her drawing nigh;Now, because I'm absent, sad,Now, because she sees me, glad!

　　Soon between us rise to sightValleys cool, with bushes light,Streams and meadows; next appear

　　Mills and wheels, the surest tokenThat a level spot is near,

　　Plains far-stretching and unbroken.And so onwards, onwards roam,To my garden and my home!

　　But how comes it then to pass?All this gives no joy, alas!--I was ravish'd by her sight,By her eyes so fair and bright,By her footstep soft and light.How her peerless charms I praised,When from head to foot I gazed!I am here, she's far away,--I am gone, with her to stay.

　　If on rugged hills she wander,

　　If she haste the vale along,Pinions seem to flutter yonder,

　　And the air is fill'd with song;With the glow of youth still playing,

　　Joyous vigour in each limb,One in silence is delaying,

　　She alone 'tis blesses him.

　　Love, thou art too fair, I ween!Fairer I have never seen!From the heart full easilyBlooming flowers are cull'd by thee.If I think: "Oh, were it so,"Bone and marrow seen to glow!If rewarded by her love,Can I greater rapture prove?

　　And still fairer is the bride,When in me she will confide,When she speaks and lets me knowAll her tale of joy and woe.All her lifetime's historyNow is fully known to me.Who in child or woman e'erSoul and body found so fair?

　　1815.-----NEXT YEAR'S SPRING.

　　THE bed of flowers

　　Loosens amain,The beauteous snowdrops

　　Droop o'er the plain.The crocus opens

　　Its glowing bud,Like emeralds others,

　　Others, like blood.With saucy gesture

　　Primroses flare,And roguish violets,

　　Hidden with care;And whatsoever

　　There stirs and strives,The Spring's contented,

　　If works and thrives.

　　'Mongst all the blossoms

　　That fairest are,My sweetheart's sweetness

　　Is sweetest far;Upon me ever

　　Her glances light,My song they waken,

　　My words make bright,An ever open

　　And blooming mind,In sport, unsullied,

　　In earnest, kind.Though roses and lilies

　　By Summer are brought,Against my sweetheart

　　Prevails he nought.

　　1816.-----AT MIDNIGHT HOUR.

　　[Goethe relates that a remarkable situation he was in one brightmoonlight night led to the composition of this sweet song, whichwas "the dearer to him because he could not say whence it cameand whither it would."]

　　AT midnight hour I went, not willingly,

　　A little, little boy, yon churchyard past,To Father Vicar's house; the stars on high

　　On all around their beauteous radiance cast,

　　At midnight hour.

　　And when, in journeying o'er the path of life,

　　My love I follow'd, as she onward moved,With stars and northern lights o'er head in strife,

　　Going and coming, perfect bliss I proved

　　At midnight hour.

　　Until at length the full moon, lustre-fraught,

　　Burst thro' the gloom wherein she was enshrined;And then the willing, active, rapid thought

　　Around the past, as round the future twined,

　　At midnight hour.

　　1818.-----TO THE RISING FULL MOON.

　　Dornburg, 25th August, 1828.

　　WILT thou suddenly enshroud thee,

　　Who this moment wert so nigh?Heavy rising masses cloud thee,

　　Thou art hidden from mine eye.

　　Yet my sadness thou well knowest,

　　Gleaming sweetly as a star!That I'm loved, 'tis thou that showest,

　　Though my loved one may be far.

　　Upward mount then! clearer, milder,

　　Robed in splendour far more bright!Though my heart with grief throbs wilder,

　　Fraught with rapture is the night!

　　1828.-----THE BRIDEGROOM.*

　　(Not in the English sense of the word, but the German, where ithas the meaning of betrothed.)

　　I SLEPT,--'twas midnight,--in my bosom woke,

　　As though 'twere day, my love-o'erflowing heart;To me it seemed like night, when day first broke;

　　What is't to me, whate'er it may impart?

　　She was away; the world's unceasing strife

　　For her alone I suffer'd through the heatOf sultry day; oh, what refreshing life

　　At cooling eve!--my guerdon was complete.

　　The sun now set, and wand'ring hand in hand,

　　His last and blissful look we greeted then;While spake our eyes, as they each other scann'd:

　　"From the far east, let's trust, he'll come again!"

　　At midnight!--the bright stars, in vision blest,

　　Guide to the threshold where she slumbers calm:Oh be it mine, there too at length to rest,--

　　Yet howsoe'er this prove, life's full of charm!

　　1828.-----SUCH, SUCH IS HE WHO PLEASETH ME.

　　FLY, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!

　　He who found thee one fair morn in Spring

　　In the wood where thou thy flight didst wing.Fly, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!Never rests the foot of evil spy.

　　Hark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains

　　Reach the loved one, borne there by the wind,

　　In the soft heart open doors they find.Hark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains,Hark!--yet blissful love their echo pains.

　　Erect his head, and firm his tread,

　　Raven hair around his smooth brow strays,

　　On his cheeks a Spring eternal plays.Erect his head, and firm his tread,And by grace his ev'ry step is led.

　　Happy his breast, with pureness bless'd,

　　And the dark eyes 'neath his eyebrows placed,

　　With full many a beauteous line are graced.Happy his breast, with pureness bless'd,Soon as seen, thy love must be confess'd.

　　His mouth is red--its power I dread,

　　On his lips morn's fragrant incense lies,

　　Round his lips the cooling Zephyr sighs.His mouth is red--its power I dread,With one glance from him, all sorrow's fled.

　　His blood is true, his heart bold too,

　　In his soft arms, strength, protection, dwells

　　And his face with noble pity swells.His blood is true, his heart bold too,Blest the one whom those dear arms may woo!

　　1816..-----SICILIAN SONG.

　　YE black and roguish eyes,

　　If ye command.Each house in ruins lies,

　　No town can stand.And shall my bosom's chain,--

　　This plaster wall,?To think one moment, deign,--

　　Shall ii not fall?

　　1811.-----SWISS SONG,

　　Up in th' mountainI was a-sitting,With the bird thereAs my guest,Blithely singing,Blithely springing,And buildingHis nest.

　　In the gardenI was a-standing,And the bee thereSaw as well,Buzzing, humming,Going, coming,And buildingHis cell.

　　O'er the meadowI was a-going,And there saw theButterflies,Sipping, dancing,Flying, glancing,And charmingThe eyes.

　　And then came myDear Hansel,And I show'd themWith glee,Sipping, quaffing,And he, laughing,Sweet kissesGave me.

　　1811.-----FINNISH SONG.

　　IF the loved one, the well-known one,Should return as he departed,On his lips would ring my kisses,Though the wolf's blood might have dyed them;And a hearty grasp I'd give him,Though his finger-ends were serpents.

　　Wind! Oh, if thou hadst but reason,Word for word in turns thou'dst carry,E'en though some perchance might perish'Tween two lovers so far distant.

　　All choice morsels I'd dispense with,Table-flesh of priests neglect too,Sooner than renounce my lover,Whom, in Summer having vanquish'd,I in Winter tamed still longer.

　　1810.-----GIPSY SONG.

　　IN the drizzling mist, with the snow high-pil'd,In the Winter night, in the forest wild,I heard the wolves with their ravenous howl,I heard the screaming note of the owl:

　　Wille wau wau wau!

　　Wille wo wo wo!

　　Wito hu!

　　I shot, one day, a cat in a ditch--The dear black cat of Anna the witch;Upon me, at night, seven were-wolves came down,Seven women they were, from out of the town.

　　Wille wau wau wau!

　　Wille wo wo wo!

　　Wito hu!

　　I knew them all; ay, I knew them straight;First, Anna, then Ursula, Eve, and Kate,And Barbara, Lizzy, and Bet as well;And forming a ring, they began to yell:

　　Wille wau wau wau!

　　Wille wo wo wo!

　　Wito hu!

　　Then call'd I their names with angry threat:"What wouldst thou, Anna? What wouldst thou, Bet?"At hearing my voice, themselves they shook,And howling and yelling, to flight they took.

　　Wille wau wau wau!

　　1772.-----THE DESTRUCTION OF MAGDEBURG.

　　[For a fine account of the fearful sack of Magdeburg, by Tilly,in the year 1613, see SCHILLER's History of the Thirty Years'War.]

　　OH, Magdeberg the town!Fair maids thy beauty crown,Thy charms fair maids and matrons crown;Oh, Magdeburg the town!

　　Where all so blooming stands,Advance fierce Tilly's bands;O'er gardens and o'er well--till'd landsAdvance fierce Tilly's bands.

　　Now Tilly's at the gate.Our homes who'll liberate?Go, loved one, hasten to the gate,And dare the combat straight!

　　There is no need as yet,However fierce his threat;Thy rosy cheeks I'll kiss, sweet pet!There is no need as yet.

　　My longing makes me pale.Oh, what can wealth avail?E'en now thy father may be pale.Thou mak'st my courage fail.

　　Oh, mother, give me bread!Is then my father dead?Oh, mother, one small crust of bread!Oh, what misfortune dread!

　　Thy father, dead lies he,The trembling townsmen flee,Adown the street the blood runs free;Oh, whither shall we flee?

　　The churches ruined lie,The houses burn on high,The roofs they smoke, the flames out fly,Into the street then hie!

　　No safety there they meet!The soldiers fill the Street,With fire and sword the wreck complete:No safety there they meet!

　　Down falls the houses' line,Where now is thine or mine?That bundle yonder is not thine,Thou flying maiden mine!

　　The women sorrow sore.The maidens far, far more.The living are no virgins more;Thus Tilly's troops make war!-----

　　FAMILIAR SONGS.

　　------What we sing in companySoon from heart to heart will fly.-----

　　THE Gesellige Lieder, which I have angicisled as above, asseveral of them cannot be called convivial songs, are separatedby Goethe from his other songs, and I have adhered to the samearrangement. The Ergo bibamus is a well-known drinking song inGermany, where it enjoys vast popularity.

　　ON THE NEW YEAR.

　　[Composed for a merry party that used to meet, in 1802, atGoethe's house.]

　　FATE now allows us,

　　'Twixt the departing

　　And the upstarting,Happy to be;And at the call of

　　Memory cherish'd,

　　Future and perish'dMoments we see.

　　Seasons of anguish,--

　　Ah, they must ever

　　Truth from woe sever,Love and joy part;Days still more worthy

　　Soon will unite us,

　　Fairer songs light us,Strength'ning the heart.

　　We, thus united,

　　Think of, with gladness,

　　Rapture and sadness,Sorrow now flies.Oh, how mysterious

　　Fortune's direction!

　　Old the connection,

　　New-born the prize!

　　Thank, for this, Fortune,

　　Wavering blindly!

　　Thank all that kindlyFate may bestow!Revel in change's

　　Impulses clearer,

　　Love far sincerer,More heartfelt glow!

　　Over the old one,

　　Wrinkles collected,

　　Sad and dejected,Others may view;But, on us gently

　　Shineth a true one,

　　And to the new oneWe, too, are new.

　　As a fond couple

　　'Midst the dance veering,

　　First disappearing,Then reappear,So let affection

　　Guide thro' life's mazy

　　Pathways so hazyInto the year!

　　1802.-----ANNIVERSARY SONG.

　　[This little song describes the different members of the partyjust spoken of.]

　　WHY pacest thou, my neighbour fair,

　　The garden all alone?If house and land thou seek'st to guard,

　　I'd thee as mistress own.

　　My brother sought the cellar-maid,

　　And suffered her no rest;She gave him a refreshing draught,

　　A kiss, too, she impress'd.

　　My cousin is a prudent wight,

　　The cook's by him ador'd;He turns the spit round ceaselessly,

　　To gain love's sweet reward.

　　We six together then began

　　A banquet to consume,When lo! a fourth pair singing came,

　　And danced into the room.

　　Welcome were they,--and welcome too

　　Was a fifth jovial pair.Brimful of news, and stored with tales

　　And jests both new and rare.

　　For riddles, spirit, raillery,

　　And wit, a place remain'd;A sixth pair then our circle join'd,

　　And so that prize was gain'd.

　　And yet to make us truly blest,

　　One miss'd we, and full sore;A true and tender couple came,--

　　We needed them no more.

　　The social banquet now goes on,

　　Unchequer'd by alloy;The sacred double-numbers then

　　Let us at once enjoy!

　　1802.-----THE SPRING ORACLE.

　　OH prophetic bird so bright,Blossom-songster, cuckoo bight!In the fairest time of year,Dearest bird, oh! deign to hearWhat a youthful pair would pray,Do thou call, if hope they may:Thy cuck-oo, thy cuck-oo.Ever more cuck-oo, cuck-oo!

　　Hearest thou? A loving pairFain would to the altar fare;Yes! a pair in happy youth,Full of virtue, full of truth.Is the hour not fix'd by fate?Say, how long must they still wait?Hark! cuck-oo! hark! cuck-oo!Silent yet! for shame, cuck-oo!

　　'Tis not our fault, certainly!Only two years patient be!But if we ourselves please here,Will pa-pa-papas appear?Know that thou'lt more kindness do us,More thou'lt prophesy unto us.One! cuck-oo! Two! cuck-oo!Ever, ever, cuck-oo, cuck-oo, coo!

　　If we've calculated clearly,We have half a dozen nearly.If good promises we'll give,Wilt thou say how long we'II live?Truly, we'll confess to thee,We'd prolong it willingly.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!

　　Life is one continued feast--(If we keep no score, at least).If now we together dwell,Will true love remain as well?For if that should e'er decay,Happiness would pass away.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!

　　1803.*(Gracefully in infinitum.)-----THE HAPPY COUPLE.

　　AFTER these vernal rains

　　That we so warmly sought,Dear wife, see how our plains

　　With blessings sweet are fraught!We cast our distant gaze

　　Far in the misty blue;Here gentle love still strays,

　　Here dwells still rapture true.

　　Thou seest whither go

　　Yon pair of pigeons white,Where swelling violets blow

　　Round sunny foliage bright.'Twas there we gather'd first

　　A nosegay as we roved;There into flame first burst

　　The passion that we proved.

　　Yet when, with plighted troth,

　　The priest beheld us fareHome from the altar both,

　　With many a youthful pair,--Then other moons had birth,

　　And many a beauteous sun,Then we had gain'd the earth

　　Whereon life's race to run.

　　A hundred thousand fold

　　The mighty bond was seal'd;In woods, on mountains cold,

　　In bushes, in the field,Within the wall, in caves,

　　And on the craggy height,And love, e'en o'er the waves,

　　Bore in his tube the light.

　　Contented we remain'd,

　　We deem'd ourselves a pair;'Twas otherwise ordain'd,

　　For, lo! a third was there;A fourth, fifth, sixth appear'd,

　　And sat around our board;And now the plants we've rear'd

　　High o'er our heads have soar'd!

　　How fair and pleasant looks,

　　On yonder beauteous spot,Embraced by poplar-brooks,

　　The newly-finish'd cot!Who is it there that sits

　　In that glad home above?Is't not our darling Fritz

　　With his own darling love?

　　Beside yon precipice,

　　Whence pent-up waters steal,And leaving the abyss,

　　Fall foaming through the wheel,Though people often tell

　　Of millers' wives so fair,Yet none can e'er excel

　　Our dearest daughter there!

　　Yet where the thick-set green

　　Stands round yon church and sad,Where the old fir-tree's seen

　　Alone tow'rd heaven to nod,--'Tis there the ashes lie

　　Of our untimely dead;From earth our gaze on high

　　By their blest memory's led.

　　See how yon hill is bright

　　With billowy-waving arms!The force returns, whose might

　　Has vanquished war's alarms.Who proudly hastens here

　　With wreath-encircled brow?'Tis like our child so dear

　　Thus Charles comes homeward now.

　　That dearest honour'd guest

　　Is welcom'd by the bride;She makes the true one blest,

　　At the glad festal tide.And ev'ry one makes haste

　　To join the dance with glee;While thou with wreaths hast graced

　　The youngest children three.

　　To sound of flute and horn

　　The time appears renew'd,When we, in love's young morn,

　　In the glad dance upstood;And perfect bliss I know

　　Ere the year's course is run,For to the font we go

　　With grandson and with son!

　　1803.*-----SONG OF FELLOWSHIP.

　　[Written and sung in honour of the birthday of the Pastor Ewaldat the time of Goethe's happy connection with Lily.]

　　IN ev'ry hour of joy

　　That love and wine prolong,The moments we'll employ

　　To carol forth this song!We're gathered in His name,

　　Whose power hath brought us here;He kindled first our flame,

　　He bids it burn more clear.

　　Then gladly glow to-night,

　　And let our hearts combine!Up! quaff with fresh delight

　　This glass of sparkling wine!Up! hail the joyous hour,

　　And let your kiss be true;With each new bond of power

　　The old becomes the new!

　　Who in our circle lives,

　　And is not happy there?True liberty it gives,

　　And brother's love so fair.Thus heart and heart through life

　　With mutual love are fill'd;And by no causeless strife

　　Our union e'er is chill'd.

　　Our hopes a God has crown'd

　　With life-discernment free,And all we view around,

　　Renews our ecstasy.Ne'er by caprice oppress'd,

　　Our bliss is ne'er destroy'd;More freely throbs our breast,

　　By fancies ne'er alloy'd.

　　Where'er our foot we set,

　　The more life's path extends,And brighter, brighter yet

　　Our gaze on high ascends.We know no grief or pain,

　　Though all things fall and rise;Long may we thus remain!

　　Eternal be our ties!

　　1775.-----CONSTANCY IN CHANGE.

　　COULD this early bliss but rest

　　Constant for one single hour!But e'en now the humid West

　　Scatters many a vernal shower.Should the verdure give me joy?

　　'Tis to it I owe the shade;Soon will storms its bloom destroy,

　　Soon will Autumn bid it fade.

　　Eagerly thy portion seize,

　　If thou wouldst possess the fruit!Fast begin to ripen these,

　　And the rest already shoot.With each heavy storm of rain

　　Change comes o'er thy valley fair;Once, alas! but not again

　　Can the same stream hold thee e'er.

　　And thyself, what erst at least

　　Firm as rocks appear'd to rise,Walls and palaces thou seest

　　But with ever-changing eyes.Fled for ever now the lip

　　That with kisses used to glow,And the foot, that used to skip

　　O'er the mountain, like the roe.

　　And the hand, so true and warm,

　　Ever raised in charity,And the cunning-fashion'd form,--

　　All are now changed utterly.And what used to bear thy name,

　　When upon yon spot it stood,Like a rolling billow came,

　　Hast'ning on to join the flood.

　　Be then the beginning found

　　With the end in unison,Swifter than the forms around

　　Are themselves now fleeting on!Thank the merit in thy breast,

　　Thank the mould within thy heart,That the Muses' favour blestNe'er will perish, ne'er depart.

　　1803.*-----TABLE SONG.

　　[Composed for the merry party already mentioned, on the occasionof the departure for France of the hereditary prince, who was oneof the number, and who is especially alluded to in the 3rdverse.]

　　O'ER me--how I cannot say,--

　　Heav'nly rapture's growing.Will it help to guide my way

　　To yon stars all-glowing?Yet that here I'd sooner be,

　　To assert I'm able,Where, with wine and harmony,

　　I may thump the table.

　　Wonder not, my dearest friends,

　　What 'tis gives me pleasure;For of all that earth e'er lends,

　　'Tis the sweetest treasure.Therefore solemnly I swear,

　　With no reservation,That maliciously I'll ne'er

　　Leave my present station.

　　Now that here we're gather'd round,

　　Chasing cares and slumbers,Let, methought, the goblet sound

　　To the bard's glad numbers!Many a hundred mile away,

　　Go those we love dearly;Therefore let us here to-day

　　Make the glass ring clearly!

　　Here's His health, through Whom we live!

　　I that faith inherit.To our king the next toast give,

　　Honour is his merit,'Gainst each in-- and outward foe

　　He's our rock and tower.Of his maintenance thinks he though,

　　More that grows his power.

　　Next to her good health I drink,

　　Who has stirr'd my passion;Of his mistress let each think,

　　Think in knightly fashion.If the beauteous maid but see

　　Whom 'tis I now call so,Let her smiling nod to me:

　　"Here's my love's health also!"

　　To those friends,--the two or three,--

　　Be our next toast given,In whose presence revel we,

　　In the silent even,--Who the gloomy mist so cold

　　Scatter gently, lightly;To those friends, then, new or old,

　　Let the toast ring brightly.

　　Broader now the stream rolls on,

　　With its waves more swelling,While in higher, nobler tone,

　　Comrades, we are dwelling,--We who with collected might,

　　Bravely cling together,Both in fortune's sunshine bright,

　　And in stormy weather.

　　Just as we are gather'd thus,

　　Others are collected;On them, therefore, as on us,

　　Be Fate's smile directed!From the springhead to the sea,

　　Many a mill's revolving,And the world's prosperity

　　Is the task I'm solving.

　　1802.-----WONT AND DONE.

　　I HAVE loved; for the first time with passion I rave!I then was the servant, but now am the slave;

　　I then was the servant of all:By this creature so charming I now am fast bound,To love and love's guerdon she turns all around,

　　And her my sole mistress I call.

　　l've had faith; for the first time my faith is now strong!And though matters go strangely, though matters go wrong,

　　To the ranks of the faithful I'm true:Though ofttimes 'twas dark and though ofttimes 'twas drear,In the pressure of need, and when danger was near,

　　Yet the dawning of light I now view.

　　I have eaten; but ne'er have thus relish'd my food!For when glad are the senses, and joyous the blood,

　　At table all else is effacedAs for youth, it but swallows, then whistles an air;As for me, to a jovial resort I'd repair,

　　Where to eat, and enjoy what I taste.

　　I have drunk; but have never thus relish'd the bowl!For wine makes us lords, and enlivens the soul,

　　And loosens the trembling slave's tongue.Let's not seek to spare then the heart-stirring drink,For though in the barrel the old wine may sink,

　　In its place will fast mellow the young.

　　I have danced, and to dancing am pledged by a vow!Though no caper or waltz may be raved about now,

　　In a dance that's becoming, whirl round.And he who a nosegay of flowers has dress'd,And cares not for one any more than the rest,

　　With a garland of mirth is aye crown'd.

　　Then once more be merry, and banish all woes!For he who but gathers the blossoming rose.

　　By its thorns will be tickled alone.To-day still, as yesterday, glimmers the star;Take care from all heads that hang down to keep far,

　　And make but the future thine own.

　　1813.-----GENERAL CONFESSION.

　　In this noble ring to-day

　　Let my warning shame ye!Listen to my solemn voice,--

　　Seldom does it name ye.Many a thing have ye intended,

　　Many a thing have badly ended,And now I must blame ye.

　　At some moment in our lives

　　We must all repent us!So confess, with pious trust,

　　All your sins momentous!Error's crooked pathways shunning.

　　Let us, on the straight road running,Honestly content us!

　　Yes! we've oft, when waking, dream'd,

　　Let's confess it rightly;Left undrain'd the brimming cup,

　　When it sparkled brightly;Many a shepherd's-hour's soft blisses,

　　Many a dear mouth's flying kissesWe've neglected lightly.

　　Mute and silent have we sat,

　　Whilst the blockheads prated,And above e'en song divine

　　Have their babblings rated;To account we've even call'd us

　　For the moments that enthrall'd us,With enjoyment freighted.

　　If thou'lt absolution grant

　　To thy true ones ever,We, to execute thy will,

　　Ceaseless will endeavour,From half-measures strive to wean us,

　　Wholly, fairly, well demean us,Resting, flagging never.

　　At all blockheads we'll at once

　　Let our laugh ring clearly,And the pearly-foaming wine

　　Never sip at merely.Ne'er with eye alone give kisses,

　　But with boldness suck in blissesFrom those lips loved dearly.

　　1803.*-----COPTIC SONG.

　　LEAVE we the pedants to quarrel and strive,

　　Rigid and cautious the teachers to be!All of the wisest men e'er seen alive

　　Smile, nod, and join in the chorus with me:"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

　　Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"

　　Merlin the old, from his glittering grave,When I, a stripling, once spoke to him,--gave

　　Just the same answer as that I've preferr'd;"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

　　Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"

　　And on the Indian breeze as it booms,And in the depths of Egyptian tombs,

　　Only the same holy saying I've heard:"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

　　Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"

　　1789.*-----ANOTHER.

　　Go! obedient to my call,

　　Turn to profit thy young days,

　　Wiser make betimes thy breast

　　In Fate's balance as it sways,

　　Seldom is the cock at rest;Thou must either mount, or fall,

　　Thou must either rule and win,

　　Or submissively give in,Triumph, or else yield to clamour:Be the anvil or the hammer.

　　1789.-----VANITAS! VANITATUM VANITAS!

　　MY trust in nothing now is placed,

　　Hurrah!So in the world true joy I taste,

　　Hurrah!Then he who would be a comrade of mineMust rattle his glass, and in chorus combine,Over these dregs of wine.

　　I placed my trust in gold and wealth,

　　Hurrah!But then I lost all joy and health,

　　Lack-a-day!Both here and there the money roll'd,And when I had it here, behold,From there had fled the gold!

　　I placed my trust in women next,

　　Hurrah!But there in truth was sorely vex'd,

　　Lack-a-day!The False another portion sought,The True with tediousness were fraught,The Best could not be bought.

　　My trust in travels then I placed,

　　Hurrah!And left my native land in haste.

　　Lack-a-day!But not a single thing seem'd good,The beds were bad, and strange the food,And I not understood.

　　I placed my trust in rank and fame,

　　Hurrah!Another put me straight to shame,

　　Lack-a-day!And as I had been prominent,All scowl'd upon me as I went,I found not one content.

　　I placed my trust in war and fight,

　　Hurrah!We gain'd full many a triumph bright,

　　Hurrah!Into the foeman's land we cross'd,We put our friends to equal cost,And there a leg I lost.

　　My trust is placed in nothing now,

　　Hurrah!At my command the world must bow,

　　Hurrah!And as we've ended feast and strain,The cup we'll to the bottom drain;No dregs must there remain!

　　1806.-----FORTUNE OF WAR.

　　NOUGHT more accursed in war I know

　　Than getting off scot-free;Inured to danger, on we go

　　In constant victory;We first unpack, then pack again,

　　With only this reward,That when we're marching, we complain,

　　And when in camp, are bor'd.

　　The time for billeting comes next,--

　　The peasant curses it;Each nobleman is sorely vex'd,

　　'Tis hated by the cit.Be civil, bad though be thy food,

　　The clowns politely treat;If to our hosts we're ever rude,

　　Jail-bread we're forced to eat.

　　And when the cannons growl around,

　　And small arms rattle clear,And trumpet, trot, and drum resound,

　　We merry all appear;And as it in the fight may chance,

　　We yield, then charge amain,And now retire, and now advance,

　　And yet a cross ne'er gain.

　　At length there comes a musket-ball,

　　And hits the leg, please Heaven;And then our troubles vanish all,

　　For to the town we're driven,(Well cover'd by the victor's force,)

　　Where we in wrath first came,--The women, frightened then, of course,

　　Are loving now and tame.

　　Cellar and heart are open'd wide,

　　The cook's allow'd no rest;While beds with softest down supplied

　　Are by our members press'd.The nimble lads upon us wait,

　　No sleep the hostess takesHer shift is torn in pieces straight,--

　　What wondrous lint it makes!

　　If one has tended carefully

　　The hero's wounded limb,Her neighbour cannot rest, for she

　　Has also tended him.A third arrives in equal haste,

　　At length they all are there,And in the middle he is placed

　　Of the whole band so fair!

　　On good authority the king

　　Hears how we love the fight,And bids them cross and ribbon bring,

　　Our coat and breast to dight.Say if a better fate can e'er

　　A son of Mars pursue!'Midst tears at length we go from there,

　　Beloved and honour'd too.

　　1814.-----OPEN TABLE.

　　MANY a guest I'd see to-day,

　　Met to taste my dishes!Food in plenty is prepar'd,

　　Birds, and game, and fishes.Invitations all have had,

　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

　　Are they hither wending?

　　Pretty girls I hope to see,

　　Dear and guileless misses,Ignorant how sweet it is

　　Giving tender kisses.Invitations all have had,

　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

　　Are they hither wending?

　　Women also I expect,

　　Loving tow'rd their spouses,Whose rude grumbling in their breasts

　　Greater love but rouses.Invitations they've had too,

　　All proposed attending!Johnny, go and look around!

　　Are they hither wending?

　　I've too ask'd young gentlemen,

　　Who are far from haughty,And whose purses are well-stock'd,

　　Well-behaved, not haughty.These especially I ask'd,

　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

　　Are they hither wending?

　　Men I summon'd with respect,

　　Who their own wives treasure;Who in ogling other Fair

　　Never take a pleasure.To my greetings they replied,

　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

　　Are they hither wending?

　　Then to make our joy complete,

　　Poets I invited,Who love other's songs far more

　　Than what they've indited.All acceded to my wish,

　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

　　Are they hither wending?

　　Not a single one appears,

　　None seem this way posting.All the soup boils fast away,

　　Joints are over-roasting.Ah, I fear that we have been

　　Rather too unbending!Johnny, tell me what you think!

　　None are hither wending.

　　Johnny, run and quickly bring

　　Other guests to me now!Each arriving as he is--

　　That's the plan, I see now.In the town at once 'tis known,

　　Every one's commending.Johnny, open all the doors:

　　All are hither wending!

　　1815.*-----THE RECKONING.

　　LEADER.

　　LET no cares now hover o'er us

　　Let the wine unsparing run!Wilt thou swell our merry chorus?

　　Hast thou all thy duty done?

　　SOLO.

　　Two young folks--the thing is curious--

　　Loved each other; yesterdayBoth quite mild, to-day quite furious,

　　Next day, quite the deuce to pay!If her neck she there was stooping,

　　He must here needs pull his hair.I revived their spirits drooping,

　　And they're now a happy pair.

　　CHORUS.

　　Surely we for wine may languish!

　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

　　SOLO.

　　Why, young orphan, all this wailing?

　　"Would to heaven that I were dead!For my guardian's craft prevailing

　　Soon will make me beg my bread."Knowing well the rascal genus,

　　Into court I dragg'd the knave;Fair the judges were between us,

　　And the maiden's wealth did save.

　　CHORUS.

　　Surely we for wine may languish!

　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

　　SOLO.

　　To a little fellow, quiet,

　　Unpretending and subdued,Has a big clown, running riot,

　　Been to-day extremely rude.I bethought me of my duty,

　　And my courage swell'd apace,So I spoil'd the rascal's beauty,

　　Slashing him across the face.

　　CHORUS.

　　Surely we for wine may languish!

　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

　　SOLO.

　　Brief must be my explanation,

　　For I really have done nought.Free from trouble and vexation,

　　I a landlord's business bought.There I've done, with all due ardour,

　　All that duty order'd me;Each one ask'd me for the larder,

　　And there was no scarcity.

　　CHORUS.

　　Surely we for wine may languish!

　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

　　Each should thus make proclamation

　　Of what he did well to-day!That's the match whose conflagration

　　Should inflame our tuneful lay.Let it be our precept ever

　　To admit no waverer here!For to act the good endeavour,

　　None but rascals meek appear.

　　CHORUS.

　　Surely we for wine may languish!

　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

　　We have now in rapture drown'd.

　　TRIO.

　　Let each merry minstrel enter,

　　He's right welcome to our hall!'Tis but with the selftormentor

　　That we are not liberal;

　　For we fear that his caprices,

　　That his eye-brows dark and sad,That his grief that never ceases

　　Hide an empty heart, or bad.

　　CHORUS.

　　No one now for wine shall languish!

　　Here no minstrel shall be found,Who all sighs and groans of anguish,

　　Has not first in rapture drown'd!

　　1810.-----ERGO BIBAMUS!

　　FOR a praiseworthy object we're now gather'd here,

　　So, brethren, sing: ERGO BIBAMUS!Tho' talk may be hush'd, yet the glasses ring clear,

　　Remember then: ERGO BIBAMUS!In truth 'tis an old, 'tis an excellent word,With its sound so befitting each bosom is stirr'd,And an echo the festal hall filling is heard,

　　A glorious ERGO BIBAMUS!

　　I saw mine own love in her beauty so rare,

　　And bethought me of: ERGO BIBAMUS;So I gently approach'd, and she let me stand there,

　　While I help'd myself, thinking: BIBAMUS!And when she's appeased, and will clasp you and kiss,Or when those embraces and kisses ye miss,Take refuge, till sound is some worthier bliss,

　　In the comforting ERGO BIBAMUS!

　　I am call'd by my fate far away from each friend;

　　Ye loved ones, then: ERGO BIBAMUS!With wallet light-laden from hence I must wend.

　　So double our ERGO BIBAMUS!Whate'er to his treasures the niggard may add,Yet regard for the joyous will ever be had,For gladness lends over its charms to the glad,

　　So, brethren, sing; ERGO BIBAMUS!

　　And what shall we say of to-day as it flies?

　　I thought but of: ERGO BIBAMUS'Tis one of those truly that seldom arise,

　　So again and again sing: BIBAMUS!For joy through a wide-open portal it guides,Bright glitter the clouds, as the curtain divides,An a form, a divine one, to greet us in glides,

　　While we thunder our: ERGO BIBAMUS!

　　1810.-----EPIPHANIAS.

　　THE three holy kings with their star's bright ray,--They eat and they drink, but had rather not pay;They like to eat and drink away,They eat and drink, but had rather not pay.

　　The three holy kings have all come here,In number not four, but three they appear;And if a fourth join'd the other three,Increased by one their number would be.

　　The first am I,--the fair and the white,I ought to be seen when the sun shines bright!But, alas! with all my spices and myrrh,No girl now likes me,--I please not her.

　　The next am I,--the brown and the long,Known well to women, known well to song.Instead of spices, 'tis gold I bear,And so I'm welcome everywhere.

　　The last am I,--the black and small,And fain would be right merry withal.I like to eat and to drink full measure,I eat and drink, and give thanks with pleasure.

　　The three holy kings are friendly and mild,They seek the Mother, and seek the Child;The pious Joseph is sitting by,The ox and the ass on their litter lie.

　　We're bringing gold, we're bringing myrrh,The women incense always prefer;And if we have wine of a worthy growth,We three to drink like six are not loth.

　　As here we see fair lads and lasses,But not a sign of oxen or asses,We know that we have gone astrayAnd so go further on our way.-----

　　BALLADS.

　　-----Poet's art is ever ableTo endow with truth mere fable.----MIGNON.[This universally known poem is also to be found in WilhelmMeister.]

　　KNOW'ST thou the land where the fair citron blows,Where the bright orange midst the foliage glows,Where soft winds greet us from the azure skies,Where silent myrtles, stately laurels rise,Know'st thou it well?

　　'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, beloved one, would repair.

　　Know'st thou the house? On columns rests its pile,Its halls are gleaming, and its chambers smile,And marble statues stand and gaze on me:"Poor child! what sorrow hath befallen thee?"Know'st thou it well?

　　'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, protector, would repair!

　　Know'st thou the mountain, and its cloudy bridge?The mule can scarcely find the misty ridge;In caverns dwells the dragon's olden brood,The frowning crag obstructs the raging flood.Know'st thou it well?

　　'Tis there, 'tis there,Our path lies--Father--thither, oh repair!

　　1795.*-----THE MINSTREL.

　　[This fine poem is introduced in the second book of WilhelmMeister.]

　　"WHAT tuneful strains salute mine ear

　　Without the castle walls?Oh, let the song re-echo here,

　　Within our festal halls!"Thus spake the king, the page out-hied;The boy return'd; the monarch cried:

　　"Admit the old man yonder!"

　　"All hail, ye noble lords to-night!

　　All hail, ye beauteous dames!Star placed by star! What heavenly sight!

　　Whoe'er can tell their names?Within this glittering hall sublime,Be closed, mine eyes! 'tis not the time

　　For me to feast my wonder."

　　The minstrel straightway closed his eyes,

　　And woke a thrilling tone;The knights look'd on in knightly guise,

　　Fair looks tow'rd earth were thrown.The monarch, ravish'd by the strain,Bade them bring forth a golden chain,

　　To be his numbers' guerdon.

　　"The golden chain give not to me,

　　But give the chain to thoseIn whose bold face we shiver'd see

　　The lances of our foes.Or give it to thy chancellor there;With other burdens he may bear

　　This one more golden burden.

　　"I sing, like birds of blithesome note,

　　That in the branches dwell;The song that rises from the throat

　　Repays the minstrel well.One boon I'd crave, if not too bold--One bumper in a cup of gold

　　Be as my guerdon given."

　　The bowl he raised, the bowl he quaff'd:

　　"Oh drink, with solace fraught!Oh, house thrice-blest, where such a draught

　　A trifling gift is thought!When Fortune smiles, remember me,And as I thank you heartily,

　　As warmly thank ye Heaven!"

　　1795.*-----BALLAD

　　OF THE BANISHED AND RETURNING COUNT.

　　[Goethe began to write an opera called Lowenstuhl, founded uponthe old tradition which forms the subject of this Ballad, but henever carried out his design.]

　　OH, enter old minstrel, thou time-honour'd one!We children are here in the hall all alone,

　　The portals we straightway will bar.Our mother is praying, our father is gone

　　To the forest, on wolves to make war.Oh sing us a ballad, the tale then repeat,

　　'Till brother and I learn it right;We long have been hoping a minstrel to meet,

　　For children hear tales with delight.

　　"At midnight, when darkness its fearful veil weaves,His lofty and stately old castle he leaves,

　　But first he has buried his wealth.What figure is that in his arms one perceives,

　　As the Count quits the gateway by stealth?O'er what is his mantle so hastily thrown?

　　What bears he along in his flight?A daughter it is, and she gently sleeps on"--

　　The children they hear with delight.

　　"The morning soon glimmers. the world is so wide,In valleys and forests a home is supplied,

　　The bard in each village is cheer'd.Thus lives he and wanders, while years onward glide,

　　And longer still waxes his beard;But the maiden so fair in his arms grows amain,

　　'Neath her star all-protecting and bright,Secured in the mantle from wind and from rain--"

　　The children they hear with delight.

　　"And year upon year with swift footstep now steals,The mantle it fades, many rents it reveals,

　　The maiden no more it can hold.The father he sees her, what rapture he feels!

　　His joy cannot now be controll'd.How worthy she seems of the race whence she springs,

　　How noble and fair to the sight!What wealth to her dearly-loved father she brings!"--

　　The children they hear with delight.

　　"Then comes there a princely knight galloping by,She stretches her hand out, as soon as he's nigh,

　　But alms he refuses to give.He seizes her hand, with a smile in his eye:

　　'Thou art mine!' he exclaims, 'while I live!''When thou know'st,' cries the old man, 'the treasure that'sthere,

　　A princess thou'lt make her of right;Betroth'd be she now, on this spot green and fair--'"

　　The children they hear with delight.

　　"So she's bless'd by the priest on the hallowed place,And she goes with a smiling but sorrowful face,

　　From her father she fain would not part.The old man still wanders with ne'er-changing pace,

　　He covers with joy his sad heart.So I think of my daughter, as years pass away,

　　And my grandchildren far from my sight;I bless them by night, and I bless them by day"--

　　The children they hear with delight.

　　He blesses the children: a knocking they hear,The father it is! They spring forward in fear,

　　The old man they cannot conceal--"Thou beggar, wouldst lure, then, my children so dear?

　　Straight seize him, ye vassals of steel!To the dungeon most deep, with the fool-hardy knave!"

　　The mother from far hears the fight;She hastens with flatt'ring entreaty to crave--

　　The children they hear with delight.

　　The vassals they suffer the Bard to stand there,And mother and children implore him to spare,

　　The proud prince would stifle his ire,'Till driven to fury at hearing their prayer,

　　His smouldering anger takes fire:"Thou pitiful race! Oh, thou beggarly crew!

　　Eclipsing my star, once so bright!Ye'll bring me destruction, ye sorely shall rue!"

　　The children they hear with affright.

　　The old man still stands there with dignified mien,The vassals of steel quake before him, I ween,

　　The Count's fury increases in power;"My wedded existence a curse long has been,

　　And these are the fruits from that flower!'Tis ever denied, and the saying is true,

　　That to wed with the base-born is right;The beggar has borne me a beggarly crew,--"

　　The children they hear with affright.

　　"If the husband, the father, thus treats you with scorn,If the holiest bonds by him rashly are torn,

　　Then come to your father--to me!The beggar may gladden life's pathway forlorn,

　　Though aged and weak he may be.This castle is mine! thou hast made it thy prey,

　　Thy people 'twas put me to flight;The tokens I bear will confirm what I say"--

　　The children they hear with delight.

　　"The king who erst govern'd returneth again,And restores to the Faithful the goods that were ta'en,

　　I'll unseal all my treasures the while;The laws shall be gentle, and peaceful the reign"--

　　The old man thus cries with a smile--"Take courage, my son! all hath turned out for good,

　　And each hath a star that is bright,Those the princess hath borne thee are princely in blood,"--

　　The children thy hear with delight.

　　1816.-----THE VIOLET.

　　UPON the mead a violet stood,Retiring, and of modest mood,

　　In truth, a violet fair.Then came a youthful shepherdess,And roam'd with sprightly joyousness,And blithely woo'd

　　With carols sweet the air

　　"Ah!" thought the violet, "had I beenFor but the smallest moment e'en

　　Nature's most beauteous flower,'Till gather'd by my love, and press'd,When weary, 'gainst her gentle breast,For e'en, for e'en

　　One quarter of an hour!"

　　Alas! alas! the maid drew nigh,The violet failed to meet her eye,

　　She crush'd the violet sweet.It sank and died, yet murmur'd not:"And if I die, oh, happy lot,For her I die,

　　And at her very feet!"

　　1775.*-----THE FAITHLESS BOY.

　　THERE was a wooer blithe and gay,

　　A son of France was he,--Who in his arms for many a day,

　　As though his bride were she,A poor young maiden had caress'd,And fondly kiss'd, and fondly press'd,

　　And then at length deserted.

　　When this was told the nut-brown maid,

　　Her senses straightway fled;She laugh'd and wept, and vow'd and pray'd,

　　And presently was dead.The hour her soul its farewell took,The boy was sad, with terror shook,

　　Then sprang upon his charger.

　　He drove his spurs into his side,

　　And scour'd the country round;But wheresoever he might ride,

　　No rest for him was found.For seven long days and nights he rode,It storm'd, the waters overflow'd,

　　It bluster'd, lighten'd, thunder'd.

　　On rode he through the tempest's din,

　　Till he a building spied;In search of shelter crept he in,

　　When he his steed had tied.And as he groped his doubtful way,The ground began to rock and sway,--

　　He fell a hundred fathoms.

　　When he recover'd from the blow,

　　He saw three lights pass by;He sought in their pursuit to go,

　　The lights appear'd to fly.They led his footsteps all astray,Up, down, through many a narrow way

　　Through ruin'd desert cellars.

　　When lo! he stood within a hall,

　　With hollow eyes. and grinning all;They bade him taste the fare.

　　A hundred guests sat there.He saw his sweetheart 'midst the throng,Wrapp'd up in grave-clothes white and long;

　　She turn'd, and----*

　　1774.(* This ballad is introduced in Act II. of Claudine of VillaBella, where it is suddenly broken off, as it is here.)-----THE ERL-KING.

　　WHO rides there so late through the night dark and drear?The father it is, with his infant so dear;He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm,He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm.

　　"My son, wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide?""Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side!Dost see not the Erl-King, with crown and with train?""My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain."

　　"Oh, come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me!Full many a game I will play there with thee;On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold,My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold."

　　"My father, my father, and dost thou not hearThe words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear?""Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives;'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves."

　　"Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there?My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly careMy daughters by night their glad festival keep,They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep."

　　"My father, my father, and dost thou not see,How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me?""My darling, my darling, I see it aright,'Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight."

　　"I love thee, I'm charm'd by thy beauty, dear boy!And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ.""My father, my father, he seizes me fast,Full sorely the Erl-King has hurt me at last."

　　The father now gallops, with terror half wild,He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child;He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread,--The child in his arms finds he motionless, dead.

　　1782.*-----JOHANNA SEBUS.

　　[To the memory of an excellent and beautiful girl of 17,belonging to the village of Brienen, who perished on the 13th ofJanuary, 1809, whilst giving help on the occasion of the breakingup of the ice on the Rhine, and the bursting of the dam ofCleverham.]

　　THE DAM BREAKS DOWN, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS ARISE, THE WATER HOWLS.

　　"I'll bear thee, mother, across the swell,

　　'Tis not yet high, I can wade right well."

　　"Remember us too! in what danger are we!

　　Thy fellow-lodger, and children three!

　　The trembling woman!--Thou'rt going away!"

　　She bears the mother across the spray.

　　"Quick! haste to the mound, and awhile there wait,

　　I'll soon return, and all will be straight.

　　The mound's close by, and safe from the wet;

　　But take my goat too, my darling pet!"

　　THE DAM DISSOLVES, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS DASH ON, THE WATER HOWLS.

　　She places the mother safe on the shore;

　　Fair Susan then turns tow'rd the flood once more.

　　"Oh whither? Oh whither? The breadth fast grows,

　　Both here and there the water o'erflows.

　　Wilt venture, thou rash one, the billows to brave?""THEY SHALL, AND THEY MUST BE PRESERVED FROM THE WAVE!"

　　THE DAM DISAPPEARS, THE WATER GROWLS,LIKE OCEAN BILLOWS IT HEAVES AND HOWLS.

　　Fair Susan returns by the way she had tried,

　　The waves roar around, but she turns not aside;

　　She reaches the mound, and the neighbour straight,

　　But for her and the children, alas, too late!

　　THE DAM DISAPPEAR'D,--LIKE A SEA IT GROWLS,ROUND THE HILLOCK IN CIRCLING EDDIES IT HOWLS.

　　The foaming abyss gapes wide, and whirls round,

　　The women and children are borne to the ground;

　　The horn of the goat by one is seized fast,

　　But, ah, they all must perish at last!

　　Fair Susan still stands-there, untouch'd by the wave;

　　The youngest, the noblest, oh, who now will save?

　　Fair Susan still stands there, as bright as a star,

　　But, alas! all hope, all assistance is far.

　　The foaming waters around her roar,

　　To save her, no bark pushes off from the shore.

　　Her gaze once again she lifts up to Heaven,

　　Then gently away by the flood she is driven.

　　NO DAM, NO PLAIN! TO MARK THE PLACESOME STRAGGLING TREES ARE THE ONLY TRACE.

　　The rushing water the wilderness covers,

　　Yet Susan's image still o'er it hovers.--

　　The water sinks, the plains re-appear.

　　Fair Susan's lamented with many a tear,--

　　May he who refuses her story to tell,

　　Be neglected in life and in death as well!

　　1809.-----THE FISHERMAN.

　　THE waters rush'd, the waters rose,

　　A fisherman sat by,While on his line in calm repose

　　He cast his patient eye.And as he sat, and hearken'd there,

　　The flood was cleft in twain,And, lo! a dripping mermaid fair

　　Sprang from the troubled main.

　　She sang to him, and spake the while:

　　"Why lurest thou my brood,With human wit and human guile

　　From out their native flood?Oh, couldst thou know how gladly dart

　　The fish across the sea,Thou wouldst descend, e'en as thou art,

　　And truly happy be!

　　"Do not the sun and moon with grace

　　Their forms in ocean lave?Shines not with twofold charms their face,

　　When rising from the wave?The deep, deep heavens, then lure thee not,--

　　The moist yet radiant blue,--Not thine own form,--to tempt thy lot

　　'Midst this eternal dew?"

　　The waters rush'd, the waters rose,

　　Wetting his naked feet;As if his true love's words were those,

　　His heart with longing beat.She sang to him, to him spake she,

　　His doom was fix'd, I ween;Half drew she him, and half sank he,

　　And ne'er again was seen.

　　1779.*-----THE KING OF THULE.*

　　(* This ballad is also introduced in Faust, where it is sung byMargaret.)

　　IN Thule lived a monarch,

　　Still faithful to the grave,To whom his dying mistress

　　A golden goblet gave.

　　Beyond all price he deem'd it,

　　He quaff'd it at each feast;And, when he drain'd that goblet,

　　His tears to flow ne'er ceas'd.

　　And when he felt death near him,

　　His cities o'er he told,And to his heir left all things,

　　But not that cup of gold.

　　A regal banquet held he

　　In his ancestral ball,In yonder sea-wash'd castle,

　　'Mongst his great nobles all.

　　There stood the aged reveller,

　　And drank his last life's-glow,--Then hurl'd the holy goblet

　　Into the flood below.

　　He saw it falling, filling,

　　And sinking 'neath the main,His eyes then closed for ever,

　　He never drank again.

　　THE BEAUTEOUS FLOWER.

　　SONG OF THE IMPRISONED COUNT.

　　COUNT.

　　I KNOW a flower of beauty rare,

　　Ah, how I hold it dear!To seek it I would fain repair,

　　Were I not prison'd here.My sorrow sore oppresses me,For when I was at liberty,

　　I had it close beside me.

　　Though from this castle's walls so steep

　　I cast mine eyes around,And gaze oft from the lofty keep,

　　The flower can not be found.Whoe'er would bring it to my sight,Whether a vassal he, or knight,

　　My dearest friend I'd deem him.

　　THE ROSE.

　　I blossom fair,--thy tale of woes

　　I hear from 'neath thy grate.Thou doubtless meanest me, the rose.

　　Poor knight of high estate!Thou hast in truth a lofty mind;The queen of flowers is then enshrin'd,

　　I doubt not, in thy bosom.

　　COUNT.

　　Thy red, in dress of green array'd,

　　As worth all praise I hold;And so thou'rt treasured by each maid

　　Like precious stones or gold.Thy wreath adorns the fairest faceBut still thou'rt not the flower whose grace

　　I honour here in silence.

　　THE LILY.

　　The rose is wont with pride to swell,

　　And ever seeks to rise;But gentle sweethearts love full well

　　The lily's charms to prize,The heart that fills a bosom true,That is, like me, unsullied too,

　　My merit values duly.

　　COUNT.

　　In truth, I hope myself unstain'd,

　　And free from grievous crime;Yet I am here a prisoner chain'd,

　　And pass in grief my time,To me thou art an image sureOf many a maiden, mild and pure,

　　And yet I know a dearer.

　　THE PINK.

　　That must be me, the pink, who scent

　　The warder's garden here;Or wherefore is he so intent

　　My charms with care to rear?My petals stand in beauteous ring,Sweet incense all around I fling,

　　And boast a thousand colours.

　　COUNT.

　　The pink in truth we should not slight,

　　It is the gardener's prideIt now must stand exposed to light,

　　Now in the shade abide.Yet what can make the Count's heart glowIs no mere pomp of outward show;

　　It is a silent flower.

　　THE VIOLET.

　　Here stand I, modestly half hid,

　　And fain would silence keep;Yet since to speak I now am bid,

　　I'll break my silence deep.If, worthy Knight, I am that flower,It grieves me that I have not power

　　To breathe forth all my sweetness.

　　COUNT.

　　The violet's charms I prize indeed,

　　So modest 'tis, and fair,And smells so sweet; yet more I need

　　To ease my heavy care.The truth I'll whisper in thine ear:Upon these rocky heights so drear,

　　I cannot find the loved one.

　　The truest maiden 'neath the sky

　　Roams near the stream below,And breathes forth many a gentle sigh,

　　Till I from hence can go.And when she plucks a flow'ret blue,And says "Forget-me-not!"--I, too,

　　Though far away, can feel it.

　　Ay, distance only swells love's might,

　　When fondly love a pair;Though prison'd in the dungeon's night,

　　In life I linger thereAnd when my heart is breaking nigh,"Forget-me-not!" is all I cry,

　　And straightway life returneth.

　　1798.-----SIR CURT'S WEDDING-JOURNEY.

　　WITH a bridegroom's joyous bearing,

　　Mounts Sir Curt his noble beast,To his mistress' home repairing,

　　There to hold his wedding feast;When a threatening foe advances

　　From a desert, rocky spot;For the fray they couch their lances,

　　Not delaying, speaking not.

　　Long the doubtful fight continues,

　　Victory then for Curt declares;Conqueror, though with wearied sinews,

　　Forward on his road he fares.When he sees, though strange it may be,

　　Something 'midst the foliage move;'Tis a mother, with her baby,

　　Stealing softly through the grove!

　　And upon the spot she beckons--

　　"Wherefore, love, this speed so wild?Of the wealth thy storehouse reckons,

　　Hast thou nought to give thy child!"Flames of rapture now dart through him,

　　And he longs for nothing more,While the mother seemeth to him

　　Lovely as the maid of yore.

　　But he hears his servants blowing,

　　And bethinks him of his bride;And ere long, while onward going,

　　Chances past a fair to ride;In the booths he forthwith buys him

　　For his mistress many a pledge;But, alas! some Jews surprise him,

　　And long-standing debts allege.

　　And the courts of justice duly

　　Send the knight to prison straight.Oh accursed story, truly!

　　For a hero, what a fate!Can my patience such things weather?

　　Great is my perplexity.Women, debts, and foes together,--

　　Ah, no knight escapes scot free!

　　1803.*-----WEDDING SONG.

　　THE tale of the Count our glad song shall record

　　Who had in this castle his dwelling,Where now ye are feasting the new-married lord,

　　His grandson of whom we are telling.The Count as Crusader had blazon'd his fame,Through many a triumph exalted his name,And when on his steed to his dwelling he came,

　　His castle still rear'd its proud head,But servants and wealth had all fled.

　　'Tis true that thou, Count, hast return'd to thy home,

　　But matters are faring there ill.The winds through the chambers at liberty roam,

　　And blow through the windows at willWhat's best to be done in a cold autumn night?Full many I've pass'd in more piteous plight;The morn ever settles the matter aright.

　　Then quick, while the moon shines so clear,

　　To bed on the straw, without fear,

　　And whilst in a soft pleasing slumber he lay,

　　A motion he feels 'neath his bed.The rat, an he likes it, may rattle away!

　　Ay, had he but crumbs there outspread!But lo! there appears a diminutive wight,A dwarf 'tis, yet graceful, and bearing a light,With orator-gestures that notice invite,

　　At the feet of the Count on the floor

　　Who sleeps not, though weary full sore.

　　"We've long been accustom'd to hold here our feast,

　　Since thou from thy castle first went;And as we believed thou wert far in the East,

　　To revel e'en now we were bent.And if thou'lt allow it, and seek not to chide,We dwarfs will all banquet with pleasure and pride,To honour the wealthy, the beautiful bride

　　Says the Count with a smile, half-asleep;--

　　"Ye're welcome your quarters to keep!"

　　Three knights then advance, riding all in a group,

　　Who under the bed were conceal'd;And then is a singing and noise-making troop

　　Of strange little figures reveal'd;And waggon on waggon with all kinds of things--The clatter they cause through the ear loudly rings--The like ne'er was seen save in castles of kings;

　　At length, in a chariot of gold,

　　The bride and the guests too, behold!

　　Then all at full gallop make haste to advance,

　　Each chooses his place in the hall;With whirling and waltzing, and light joyous dance,

　　They begin with their sweethearts the ball.The fife and the fiddle all merrily sound,Thy twine, and they glide, and with nimbleness bound,Thy whisper, and chatter, and, chatter around;

　　The Count on the scene casts his eye,

　　And seems in a fever to lie.

　　They hustle, and bustle, and rattle away

　　On table, on bench, and on stool;Then all who had joined in the festival gay

　　With their partners attempt to grow cool.The hams and the sausages nimbly they bear,And meat, fish, and poultry in plenty are there,Surrounded with wine of the vintage most rare:

　　And when they have revell'd full long,

　　They vanish at last with a song.

　　*      *      *      *      *      *

　　And if we're to sing all that further occurr'd,

　　Pray cease ye to bluster and prate;For what he so gladly in small saw and heard

　　He enjoy'd and he practis'd in great.For trumpets, and singing, and shouts without endOn the bridal-train, chariots and horsemen attend,They come and appear, and they bow and they bend,

　　In merry and countless array.

　　Thus was it, thus is it to-day.

　　1802.-----THE TREASURE-DIGGER

　　ALL my weary days I pass'd

　　Sick at heart and poor in purse.

　　Poverty's the greatest curse,

　　Riches are the highest good!And to end my woes at last,

　　Treasure-seeking forth I sped.

　　"Thou shalt have my soul instead!"

　　Thus I wrote, and with my blood.

　　Ring round ring I forthwith drew,

　　Wondrous flames collected there,

　　Herbs and bones in order fair,

　　Till the charm had work'd aright.Then, to learned precepts true,

　　Dug to find some treasure old,

　　In the place my art foretold

　　Black and stormy was the night.

　　Coming o'er the distant plain,

　　With the glimmer of a star,

　　Soon I saw a light afar,

　　As the hour of midnight knell'd.Preparation was in vain.

　　Sudden all was lighted up

　　With the lustre of a cup

　　That a beauteous boy upheld.

　　Sweetly seem'd his eves to laugh

　　Neath his flow'ry chaplet's load;

　　With the drink that brightly glow'd,

　　He the circle enter'd in.And he kindly bade me quaff:

　　Then methought "This child can ne'er,

　　With his gift so bright and fair,

　　To the arch-fiend be akin."

　　"Pure life's courage drink!" cried he:"This advice to prize then learn,--

　　Never to this place return

　　Trusting in thy spells absurd;Dig no longer fruitlessly.

　　Guests by night, and toil by day!

　　Weeks laborious, feast-days gay!

　　Be thy future magic-word!

　　1797.-----THE RAT-CATCHER.

　　I AM the bard known far and wide,The travell'd rat-catcher beside;A man most needful to this town,So glorious through its old renown.However many rats I see,How many weasels there may be,I cleanse the place from ev'ry one,All needs must helter-skelter run.

　　Sometimes the bard so full of cheerAs a child-catcher will appear,Who e'en the wildest captive brings,Whene'er his golden tales he sings.However proud each boy in heart,However much the maidens start,I bid the chords sweet music make,And all must follow in my wake.

　　Sometimes the skilful bard ye viewIn the form of maiden-catcher too;For he no city enters e'er,Without effecting wonders there.However coy may be each maid,However the women seem afraid,Yet all will love-sick be ere longTo sound of magic lute and song.

　　[Da Capo.]                  1803.*-----

　　THE SPINNER.

　　As I calmly sat and span,

　　Toiling with all zeal,Lo! a young and handsome man

　　Pass'd my spinning-wheel.

　　And he praised,--what harm was there?--

　　Sweet the things he said--Praised my flax-resembling hair,

　　And the even thread.

　　He with this was not content,

　　But must needs do more;And in twain the thread was rent,

　　Though 'twas safe before.

　　And the flax's stonelike weight

　　Needed to be told;But no longer was its state

　　Valued as of old.

　　When I took it to the weaver,

　　Something felt I start,And more quickly, as with fever,

　　Throbb'd my trembling heart.

　　Then I bear the thread at length

　　Through the heat, to bleach;But, alas, I scarce have strength

　　To the pool to reach.

　　What I in my little room

　　Span so fine and slight,--As was likely. I presume--

　　Came at last to light.

　　1800.*-----BEFORE A COURT OF JUSTICE.

　　THE father's name ye ne'er shall be told

　　Of my darling unborn life;"Shame, shame," ye cry, "on the strumpet bold!"

　　Yet I'm an honest wife.

　　To whom I'm wedded, ye ne'er shall be told,

　　Yet he's both loving and fair;He wears on his neck a chain of gold,

　　And a hat of straw doth he wear.

　　If scorn 'tis vain to seek to repel,

　　On me let the scorn be thrown.I know him well, and he knows me well,

　　And to God, too, all is known.

　　Sir Parson and Sir Bailiff, again,

　　I pray you, leave me in peace!My child it is, my child 'twill remain,

　　So let your questionings cease!

　　1815.*-----THE PAGE AND THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER.

　　PAGE.

　　WHERE goest thou? Where?Miller's daughter so fair!

　　Thy name, pray?--

　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.

　　'Tis Lizzy.

　　PAGE.Where goest thou? Where?With the rake in thy hand?

　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Father's meadows and land

　　To visit, I'm busy.

　　PAGE.Dost go there alone?

　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.By this rake, sir, 'tis shown

　　That we're making the hay;And the pears ripen fastIn the garden at last,

　　So I'll pick them to-day.

　　PAGE.Is't a silent thicket I yonder view?

　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Oh, yes! there are two;There's one on each side.

　　PAGE.I'll follow thee soon;When the sun burns at noonWe'll go there, o'urselves from his rays to hide,And then in some glade all-verdant and deep--

　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Why, people would say--

　　PAGE.Within mine arms thou gently wilt sleep.

　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.

　　Your pardon, I pray!Whoever is kiss'd by the miller-maid,Upon the spot must needs be betray'd.

　　'Twould give me distress

　　To cover with whiteYour pretty dark dress.Equal with equal! then all is right!That's the motto in which I delight.I am in love with the miller-boy;He wears nothing that I could destroy.

　　1797.-----THE YOUTH AND THE MILLSTREAM.

　　[This sweet Ballad, and the one entitled The Maid of the Mill'sRepentance, were written on the occasion of a visit paid by Goetheto Switzerland. The Maid of the Mill's Treachery, to which thelatter forms the sequel, was not written till the following year.]

　　YOUTH.

　　SAY, sparkling streamlet, whither thou

　　Art going!With joyous mien thy waters now

　　Are flowing.Why seek the vale so hastily?Attend for once, and answer me!

　　MILLSTREAM.

　　Oh youth, I was a brook indeed;

　　But latelyMy bed they've deepen'd, and my speed

　　Swell'd greatly,That I may haste to yonder mill.And so I'm full and never still.

　　YOUTH.

　　The mill thou seekest in a mood

　　Contented,And know'st not how my youthful blood

　　'S tormented.But doth the miller's daughter fairGaze often on thee kindly there?

　　MILLSTREAM.

　　She opes the shutters soon as light

　　Is gleaming;And comes to bathe her features bright

　　And beaming.So full and snow-white is her breast,--I feel as hot as steam suppress'd.

　　YOUTH.

　　If she in water can inflame

　　Such ardour,Surely, then, flesh and blood to tame

　　Is harder.When once is seen her beauteous face,One ever longs her steps to trace.

　　MILLSTREAM.

　　Over the wheel I, roaring, bound,

　　All-proudly,And ev'ry spoke whirls swiftly round,

　　And loudly.Since I have seen the miller's daughter,With greater vigour flows the water.

　　YOUTH.

　　Like others, then, can grief, poor brook,

　　Oppress thee?"Flow on!"--thus she'll, with smiling look,

　　Address thee.With her sweet loving glance, oh say,Can she thy flowing current stay?

　　MILLSTREAM.

　　'Tis sad, 'tis sad to have to speed

　　From yonder;I wind, and slowly through the mead

　　Would wander;And if the choice remain'd with me,Would hasten back there presently.

　　YOUTH.

　　Farewell, thou who with me dost prove

　　Love's sadness!Perchance some day thou'lt breathe of love

　　And gladness.Go, tell her straight, and often too,The boy's mute hopes and wishes true.

　　1797.-----

　　THE MAID OF THE MILL'S TREACHERY.

　　[This Ballad is introduced in the Wanderjahre, in a tale calledThe Foolish Pilgrim.]

　　WHENCE comes our friend so hastily,

　　When scarce the Eastern sky is grey?Hath he just ceased, though cold it be,

　　In yonder holy spot to pray?The brook appears to hem his path,

　　Would he barefooted o'er it go?Why curse his orisons in wrath,

　　Across those heights beclad with snow?

　　Alas! his warm bed he bath left,

　　Where he had look'd for bliss, I ween;And if his cloak too, had been reft,

　　How fearful his disgrace had been!By yonder villain sorely press'd,

　　His wallet from him has been torn;Our hapless friend has been undress'd,

　　Left well nigh naked as when born.

　　The reason why he came this road,

　　Is that he sought a pair of eyes,Which, at the mill, as brightly glow'd

　　As those that are in Paradise.He will not soon again be there;

　　From out the house he quickly hied,And when he gain'd the open air,

　　Thus bitterly and loudly cried

　　"Within her gaze, so dazzling bright,

　　No word of treachery I could read;She seem'd to see me with delight,

　　Yet plann'd e'en then this cruel deed!Could I, when basking in her smile,

　　Dream of the treason in her breast?She bade kind Cupid stay awhile,

　　And he was there, to make us blest.

　　"To taste of love's sweet ecstasy

　　Throughout the night, that endless seem'd,And for her mother's help to cry

　　Only when morning sunlight beam'd!A dozen of her kith and kin,

　　A very human flood, in-press'dHer cousins came, her aunts peer'd in,

　　And uncles, brothers, and the rest.

　　"Then what a tumult, fierce and loud!

　　Each seem'd a beast of prey to be;The maiden's honour all the crowd,

　　With fearful shout, demand of me.Why should they, madmen-like, begin

　　To fall upon a guiltless youth?For he who such a prize would win,

　　Far nimbler needs must be, in truth.

　　"The way to follow up with skill

　　His freaks, by love betimes is known:He ne'er will leave, within a mill,

　　Sweet flowers for sixteen years alone.--They stole my clothes away,--yes, all!

　　And tried my cloak besides to steal.How strange that any house so small

　　So many rascals could conceal!

　　"Then I sprang up, and raved, and swore,

　　To force a passage through them there.I saw the treacherous maid once more,

　　And she was still, alas, so fairThey all gave way before my wrath,

　　Wild outcries flew about pell-mell;At length I managed to rush forth,

　　With voice of thunder, from that hell.

　　"As maidens of the town we fly,

　　We'll shun you maidens of the village;Leave it to those of quality

　　Their humble worshippers to pillage.Yet if ye are of practised skill,

　　And of all tender ties afraid,Exchange your lovers, if ye will,

　　But never let them be betray'd."

　　Thus sings he in the winter-night,

　　While not a blade of grass was green.I laugh'd to see his piteous plight,

　　For it was well-deserved, I ween.And may this be the fate of all,

　　Who treat by day their true loves ill,And, with foolhardy daring, crawl

　　By night to Cupid's treacherous mill!

　　1798.-----THE MAID OF THE MILL'S REPENTANCE.

　　YOUTH.

　　AWAY, thou swarthy witch! Go forth

　　From out my house, I tell thee!Or else I needs must, in my wrath,

　　Expel thee!What's this thou singest so falsely, forsooth,Of love and a maiden's silent truth?

　　Who'll trust to such a story!

　　GIPSY.

　　I sing of a maid's repentant fears,

　　And long and bitter yearning;Her levity's changed to truth and tears

　　All-burning.She dreads no more the threats of her mother,She dreads far less the blows of her brother,

　　Than the dearly loved-one's hatred.

　　YOUTH.

　　Of selfishness sing and treacherous lies,

　　Of murder and thievish plunder!Such actions false will cause no surprise,

　　Or wonder.When  they share their booty, both clothes and purse,--As bad as you gipsies, and even worse,

　　Such tales find ready credence.

　　GIPSY.

　　"Alas, alas! oh what have I done?

　　Can listening aught avail me?I hear him toward my room hasten on,

　　To hail me.My heart beat high, to myself I said:'O would that thou hadst never betray'd

　　That night of love to thy mother!'"

　　YOUTH.

　　Alas! I foolishly ventured there,

　　For the cheating silence misled me;Ah, sweetest! let me to thee repair,--

　　Nor dread me!When suddenly rose a fearful din,Her mad relations came pouring in.

　　My blood still boils in my body!

　　GIPSY.

　　"Oh when will return an hour like this?

　　I pine in silent sadness;I've thrown away my only true bliss

　　With madness.Alas, poor maid! O pity my youth!My brother was then full cruel in troth

　　To treat the loved one so basely!"

　　THE POET.

　　The swarthy woman then went inside,

　　To the spring in the courtyard yonder;Her eyes from their stain she purified,

　　And,--wonder!--Her face and eyes were radiant and bright,And the maid of the mill was disclosed to the sight

　　Of the startled and angry stripling!

　　THE MAID OF THE MILL.

　　Thou sweetest, fairest, dearly-loved life!

　　Before thine anger I cower;But blows I dread not, nor sharp-edged knife,--

　　This hourOf sorrow and love to thee I'll sing,And myself before thy feet I'll fling,

　　And either live or die there!

　　YOUTH.

　　Affection, say, why buried so deep

　　In my heart hast thou lain hidden?By whom hast thou now to awake from thy sleep

　　Been bidden?Ah love, that thou art immortal I see!Nor knavish cunning nor treachery

　　Can destroy thy life so godlike.

　　THE MAID OF THE MILL.

　　If still with as fond and heartfelt love,

　　As thou once didst swear, I'm cherish'd,Then nought of the rapture we used to prove

　　Is perish'd.So take the woman so dear to thy breast!In her young and innocent charms be blest,

　　For all are thine from henceforward!

　　BOTH.

　　Now, sun, sink to rest! Now, sun, arise!

　　Ye stars, be now shining, now darkling!A star of love now gleams in the skies,

　　All-sparkling!As long as the fountain may spring and run,So long will we two be blended in one,

　　Upon each other's bosoms!

　　1797.-----THE TRAVELLER AND THE FARM~MAIDEN.

　　HE.

　　CANST thou give, oh fair and matchless maiden,

　　'Neath the shadow of the lindens yonder,--

　　Where I'd fain one moment cease to wander,--Food and drink to one so heavy laden?

　　SHE.

　　Wouldst thou find refreshment, traveller weary,

　　Bread, ripe fruit and cream to meet thy wishes,--

　　None but Nature's plain and homely dishes,--Near the spring may soothe thy wanderings dreary.

　　HE.

　　Dreams of old acquaintance now pass through me,

　　Ne'er-forgotten queen of hours of blisses.

　　Likenesses I've often found, but this isOne that quite a marvel seemeth to me!

　　SHE.

　　Travellers often wonder beyond measure,

　　But their wonder soon see cause to smother;

　　Fair and dark are often like each other,Both inspire the mind with equal pleasure.

　　HE.

　　Not now for the first time I surrender

　　To this form, in humble adoration;

　　It was brightest midst the constellationIn the hail adorn'd with festal splendour.

　　SHE.

　　Be thou joyful that 'tis in my power

　　To complete thy strange and merry story!

　　Silks behind her, full of purple glory,Floated, when thou saw'st her in that hour.

　　HE.

　　No, in truth, thou hast not sung it rightly!

　　Spirits may have told thee all about it;

　　Pearls and gems they spoke of, do not doubt it,--By her gaze eclipsed,--it gleam'd so brightly!

　　SHE.

　　This one thing I certainly collected:

　　That the fair one--(say nought, I entreat thee!)

　　Fondly hoping once again to meet thee,Many a castle in the air erected.

　　HE.

　　By each wind I ceaselessly was driven,

　　Seeking gold and honour, too, to capture!

　　When my wand'rings end, then oh, what rapture,If to find that form again 'tis given!

　　SHE.

　　'Tis the daughter of the race now banish'd

　　That thou seest, not her likeness only;

　　Helen and her brother, glad though lonely,Till this farm of their estate now vanish'd.

　　HE.

　　But the owner surely is not wanting

　　Of these plains, with ev'ry beauty teeming?

　　Verdant fields, broad meads, and pastures gleaming,Gushing springs, all heav'nly and enchanting.

　　SHE.

　　Thou must hunt the world through, wouldst thou find him!--

　　We have wealth enough in our possession,

　　And intend to purchase the succession,When the good man leaves the world behind him.

　　HE.

　　I have learnt the owner's own condition,

　　And, fair maiden, thou indeed canst buy it;

　　But the cost is great, I won't deny it,--Helen is the price,--with thy permission!

　　SHE.

　　Did then fate and rank keep us asunder,

　　And must Love take this road, and no other?

　　Yonder comes my dear and trusty brother;What will he say to it all, I wonder?

　　1803.*-----EFFECTS AT A DISTANCE.

　　THE queen in the lofty hall takes her place,

　　The tapers around her are flaming;She speaks to the page: "With a nimble pace

　　Go, fetch me my purse for gaming.

　　'Tis lying, I'll pledge,

　　On my table's edge."Each nerve the nimble boy straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.

　　The fairest of maidens was sipping sherbet

　　Beside the queen that minute;Near her mouth broke the cup,--and she got so wet!

　　The very devil seem'd in it

　　What fearful distress

　　'Tis spoilt, her gay dress.She hastens, and ev'ry nerve straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.

　　The boy was returning, and quickly came,

　　And met the sorrowing maiden;None knew of the fact,--and yet with Love's flame,

　　Those two had their hearts full laden.

　　And, oh the bliss

　　Of a moment like this!Each falls on the breast of the other,With kisses that well nigh might smother.

　　They tear themselves asunder at last,

　　To her chamber she hastens quickly,To reach the queen the page hies him fast,

　　Midst the swords and the fans crowded thickly.

　　The queen spied amain

　　On his waistcoat a stain;For nought was inscrutable to her,Like Sheba's queen--Solomon's wooer.

　　To her chief attendant she forthwith cried

　　"We lately together contended,And thou didst assert, with obstinate pride,

　　That the spirit through space never wended,--

　　That traces alone

　　By the present were shown,--That afar nought was fashion'd--not evenBy the stars that illumine you heaven.

　　"Now see! while a goblet beside me they drain'd,

　　They spilt all the drink in the chalice;And straightway the boy had his waistcoat stain'd

　　At the furthermost end of the palace.--

　　Let them newly be clad!

　　And since I am gladThat it served as a proof so decided,The cost will by me be provided."

　　1808.-----THE WALKING BELL

　　A CHILD refused to go betimes

　　To church like other people;He roam'd abroad, when rang the chimes

　　On Sundays from the steeple.

　　His mother said: "Loud rings the bell,

　　Its voice ne'er think of scorning;Unless thou wilt behave thee well,

　　'Twill fetch thee without warning."

　　The child then thought: "High over head

　　The bell is safe suspended--"So to the fields he straightway sped

　　As if 'twas school-time ended.

　　The bell now ceas'd as bell to ring,

　　Roused by the mother's twaddle;But soon ensued a dreadful thing!--

　　The bell begins to waddle.

　　It waddles fast, though strange it seem;

　　The child, with trembling wonder,Runs off, and flies, as in a dream;

　　The bell would draw him under.

　　He finds the proper time at last,

　　And straightway nimbly rushesTo church, to chapel, hastening fast

　　Through pastures, plains, and bushes.

　　Each Sunday and each feast as well,

　　His late disaster heeds he;The moment that he bears the bell,

　　No other summons needs he.

　　1813.-----FAITHFUL ECKART,

　　"OH, would we were further! Oh, would we were home,The phantoms of night tow'rd us hastily come,

　　The band of the Sorceress sisters.They hitherward speed, and on finding us here,They'll drink, though with toil we have fetch'd it, the beer,

　　And leave us the pitchers all empty."

　　Thus speaking, the children with fear take to flight,When sudden an old man appears in their sight:

　　"Be quiet, child! children, be quiet!From hunting they come, and their thirst they would still,So leave them to swallow as much as they will,

　　And the Evil Ones then will be gracious."

　　As said, so 'twas done! and the phantoms draw near,And shadowlike seem they, and grey they appear,

　　~Yet blithely they sip and they revelThe beer has all vanish'd, the pitchers are void;With cries and with shouts the wild hunters, o'erjoy'd,

　　Speed onward o'er vale and o'er mountain.

　　The children in terror fly nimbly tow'rd home,And with them the kind one is careful to come:

　　"My darlings, oh, be not so mournful!--"They'll blame us and beat us, until we are dead."--"No, no! ye will find that all goes well," he said;

　　"Be silent as mice, then, and listen!

　　"And he by whose counsels thus wisely ye're taught,Is he who with children loves ever to sport.

　　The trusty and faithful old Eckart.Ye have heard of the wonder for many a day,But ne'er had a proof of the marvellous lay,--

　　Your hands hold a proof most convincing."

　　They arrive at their home, and their pitchers they placeBy the side of their parents, with fear on their face,

　　Awaiting a beating and scolding.But see what they're tasting: the choicest of beer!Though three times and four times they quaff the good cheer

　　The pitchers remain still unemptied.

　　The marvel it lasts till the dawning of day;All people who hear of it doubtless will say:

　　"What happen'd at length to the pitchers?"In secret the children they smile, as they wait;At last, though, they stammer, and stutter, and prate,

　　And straightway the pitchers were empty.

　　And if, children, with kindness address'd ye may be,Whether father, or master, or alderman he,

　　Obey him, and follow his bidding!And if 'tis unpleasant to bridle the tongue,Yet talking is bad, silence good for the young--

　　And then will the beer fill your pitchers!

　　1813.-----THE DANCE OF DEATH.

　　THE warder looks down at the mid hour of night,

　　On the tombs that lie scatter'd below:The moon fills the place with her silvery light,

　　And the churchyard like day seems to glow.When see! first one grave, then another opes wide,And women and men stepping forth are descried,

　　In cerements snow-white and trailing.

　　In haste for the sport soon their ankles they twitch,

　　And whirl round in dances so gay;The young and the old, and the poor, and the rich,

　　But the cerements stand in their way;And as modesty cannot avail them aught here,They shake themselves all, and the shrouds soon appear

　　Scatter'd over the tombs in confusion.

　　Now waggles the leg, and now wriggles the thigh,

　　As the troop with strange gestures advance,And a rattle and clatter anon rises high,

　　As of one beating time to the dance.The sight to the warder seems wondrously queer,When the villainous Tempter speaks thus in his ear:

　　"Seize one of the shrouds that lie yonder!"

　　Quick as thought it was done! and for safety he fled

　　Behind the church-door with all speed;The moon still continues her clear light to shed

　　On the dance that they fearfully lead.But the dancers at length disappear one by one,And their shrouds, ere they vanish, they carefully don,

　　And under the turf all is quiet.

　　But one of them stumbles and shuffles there still,

　　And gropes at the graves in despair;Yet 'tis by no comrade he's treated so ill

　　The shroud he soon scents in the air.So he rattles the door--for the warder 'tis wellThat 'tis bless'd, and so able the foe to repel,

　　All cover'd with crosses in metal.

　　The shroud he must have, and no rest will allow,

　　There remains for reflection no time;On the ornaments Gothic the wight seizes now,

　　And from point on to point hastes to climb.Alas for the warder! his doom is decreed!Like a long-legged spider, with ne'er-changing speed,

　　Advances the dreaded pursuer.

　　The warder he quakes, and the warder turns pale,

　　The shroud to restore fain had sought;When the end,--now can nothing to save him avail,--

　　In a tooth formed of iron is caught.With vanishing lustre the moon's race is run,When the bell thunders loudly a powerful One,

　　And the skeleton fails, crush'd to atoms.

　　1813.-----THE PUPIL IN MAGIC.

　　I AM now,--what joy to hear it!--

　　Of the old magician rid;And henceforth shall ev'ry spirit

　　Do whate'er by me is bid;

　　I have watch'd with rigour

　　All he used to do,

　　And will now with vigour

　　Work my wonders too.

　　Wander, wander

　　Onward lightly,

　　So that rightly

　　Flow the torrent,

　　And with teeming waters yonder

　　In the bath discharge its current!

　　And now come, thou well-worn broom,

　　And thy wretched form bestir;Thou hast ever served as groom,

　　So fulfil my pleasure, sir!

　　On two legs now stand,

　　With a head on top;

　　Waterpail in hand,

　　Haste, and do not stop!

　　Wander, wander

　　Onward lightly,

　　So that rightly

　　Flow the torrent,

　　And with teeming waters yonder

　　In the bath discharge its current!

　　See! he's running to the shore,

　　And has now attain'd the pool,And with lightning speed once more

　　Comes here, with his bucket full!

　　Back he then repairs;

　　See how swells the tide!

　　How each pail he bears

　　Straightway is supplied!

　　Stop, for, lo!

　　All the measure

　　Of thy treasure

　　Now is right!--

　　Ah, I see it! woe, oh woe!

　　I forget the word of might.

　　Ah, the word whose sound can straight

　　Make him what he was before!Ah, he runs with nimble gait!

　　Would thou wert a broom once more!

　　Streams renew'd for ever

　　Quickly bringeth he;

　　River after river

　　Rusheth on poor me!

　　Now no longer

　　Can I bear him;

　　I will snare him,

　　Knavish sprite!

　　Ah, my terror waxes stronger!

　　What a look! what fearful sight

　　Oh, thou villain child of hell!

　　Shall the house through thee be drown'dFloods I see that wildly swell,

　　O'er the threshold gaining ground.

　　Wilt thou not obey,

　　Oh, thou broom accurs'd?

　　Be thou still I pray,

　　As thou wert at first!

　　Will enough

　　Never please thee?

　　I will seize thee,

　　Hold thee fast,

　　And thy nimble wood so tough,

　　With my sharp axe split at last.

　　See, once more he hastens back!

　　Now, oh Cobold, thou shalt catch it!I will rush upon his track;

　　Crashing on him falls my hatchet.

　　Bravely done, indeed!

　　See, he's cleft in twain!

　　Now from care I'm freed,

　　And can breathe again.

　　Woe, oh woe!

　　Both the parts,

　　Quick as darts,

　　Stand on end,

　　Servants of my dreaded foe!

　　Oh, ye gods protection send!

　　And they run! and wetter still

　　Grow the steps and grows the hail.Lord and master hear me call!

　　Ever seems the flood to fill,

　　Ah, he's coming! see,

　　Great is my dismay!

　　Spirits raised by me

　　Vainly would I lay!

　　"To the side

　　Of the room

　　Hasten, broom,

　　As of old!

　　Spirits I have ne'er untied

　　1797.-----THE BRIDE OF CORINTH.

　　[First published in Schiller's Horen, in connection with afriendly contest in the art of ballad-writing between the twogreat poets, to which many of their finest works are owing.]

　　ONCE a stranger youth to Corinth came,

　　Who in Athens lived, but hoped that heFrom a certain townsman there might claim,

　　As his father's friend, kind courtesy.

　　Son and daughter, they

　　Had been wont to say

　　Should thereafter bride and bridegroom be.

　　But can he that boon so highly prized,

　　Save tis dearly bought, now hope to get?They are Christians and have been baptized,

　　He and all of his are heathens yet.

　　For a newborn creed,

　　Like some loathsome weed,

　　Love and truth to root out oft will threat.

　　Father, daughter, all had gone to rest,

　　And the mother only watches late;She receives with courtesy the guest,

　　And conducts him to the room of state.

　　Wine and food are brought,

　　Ere by him besought;

　　Bidding him good night. she leaves him straight.

　　But he feels no relish now, in truth,

　　For the dainties so profusely spread;Meat and drink forgets the wearied youth,

　　And, still dress'd, he lays him on the bed.

　　Scarce are closed his eyes,

　　When a form in-hies

　　Through the open door with silent tread.

　　By his glimmering lamp discerns he now

　　How, in veil and garment white array'd,With a black and gold band round her brow,

　　Glides into the room a bashful maid.

　　But she, at his sight,

　　Lifts her hand so white,

　　And appears as though full sore afraid.

　　"Am I," cries she, "such a stranger here,

　　That the guest's approach they could not name?Ah, they keep me in my cloister drear,

　　Well nigh feel I vanquish'd by my shame.

　　On thy soft couch now

　　Slumber calmly thou!

　　I'll return as swiftly as I came."

　　"Stay, thou fairest maiden!" cries the boy,

　　Starting from his couch with eager haste:"Here are Ceres', Bacchus' gifts of joy;

　　Amor bringest thou, with beauty grac'd!

　　Thou art pale with fear!

　　Loved one let us here

　　Prove the raptures the Immortals taste."

　　"Draw not nigh, O Youth! afar remain!

　　Rapture now can never smile on me;For the fatal step, alas! is ta'en,

　　Through my mother's sick-bed phantasy.

　　Cured, she made this oath:

　　'Youth and nature both

　　Shall henceforth to Heav'n devoted be.'

　　"From the house, so silent now, are driven

　　All the gods who reign'd supreme of yore;One Invisible now rules in heaven,

　　On the cross a Saviour they adore.

　　Victims slay they here,

　　Neither lamb nor steer,But the altars reek with human gore."

　　And he lists, and ev'ry word he weighs,

　　While his eager soul drinks in each sound:"Can it be that now before my gaze

　　Stands my loved one on this silent ground?

　　Pledge to me thy troth!

　　Through our father's oath:

　　With Heav'ns blessing will our love be crown'd."

　　"Kindly youth, I never can be thine!

　　'Tis my sister they intend for thee.When I in the silent cloister pine,

　　Ah, within her arms remember me!

　　Thee alone I love,

　　While love's pangs I prove;

　　Soon the earth will veil my misery."

　　"No! for by this glowing flame I swear,

　　Hymen hath himself propitious shown:Let us to my fathers house repair,

　　And thoult find that joy is not yet flown,

　　Sweetest, here then stay,

　　And without delay

　　Hold we now our wedding feast alone!"

　　Then exchange they tokens of their truth;

　　She gives him a golden chain to wear,And a silver chalice would the youth

　　Give her in return of beauty rare.

　　"That is not for me;

　　Yet I beg of thee,One lock only give me of thy hair."

　　Now the ghostly hour of midnight knell'd,

　　And she seem'd right joyous at the sign;To her pallid lips the cup she held,

　　But she drank of nought but blood-red wine.

　　For to taste the bread

　　There before them spread,

　　Nought he spoke could make the maid incline.

　　To the youth the goblet then she brought,--

　　He too quaff'd with eager joy the bowl.Love to crown the silent feast he sought,

　　Ah! full love-sick was the stripling's soul.

　　From his prayer she shrinks,

　　Till at length he sinks

　　On the bed and weeps without control.

　　And she comes, and lays her near the boy:

　　"How I grieve to see thee sorrowing so!If thou think'st to clasp my form with joy,

　　Thou must learn this secret sad to know;

　　Yes! the maid, whom thou

　　Call'st thy loved one now,

　　Is as cold as ice, though white as snow."

　　Then he clasps her madly in his arm,

　　While love's youthful might pervades his frame:"Thou might'st hope, when with me, to grow warm,

　　E'en if from the grave thy spirit came!

　　Breath for breath, and kiss!

　　Overflow of bliss!

　　Dost not thou, like me, feel passion's flame?"

　　Love still closer rivets now their lips,

　　Tears they mingle with their rapture blest,From his mouth the flame she wildly sips,

　　Each is with the other's thought possess'd.

　　His hot ardour's flood

　　Warms her chilly blood,

　　But no heart is beating in her breast.

　　In her care to see that nought went wrong,

　　Now the mother happen'd to draw near;At the door long hearkens she, full long,

　　Wond'ring at the sounds that greet her ear.

　　Tones of joy and sadness,

　　And love's blissful madness,

　　As of bride and bridegroom they appear,

　　From the door she will not now remove

　　'Till she gains full certainty of this;And with anger hears she vows of love,

　　Soft caressing words of mutual bliss.

　　"Hush! the cock's loud strain!

　　But thoult come again,

　　When the night returns!"--then kiss on kiss.

　　Then her wrath the mother cannot hold,

　　But unfastens straight the lock with ease"In this house are girls become so bold,

　　As to seek e'en strangers' lusts to please?"

　　By her lamp's clear glow

　　Looks she in,--and oh!

　　Sight of horror!--'tis her child she sees.

　　Fain the youth would, in his first alarm,

　　With the veil that o'er her had been spread,With the carpet, shield his love from harm;

　　But she casts them from her, void of dread,

　　And with spirit's strength,

　　In its spectre length,

　　Lifts her figure slowly from the bed.

　　"Mother! mother!"--Thus her wan lips say:

　　"May not I one night of rapture share?From the warm couch am I chased away?

　　Do I waken only to despair?

　　It contents not thee

　　To have driven me

　　An untimely shroud of death to wear?

　　"But from out my coffin's prison-bounds

　　By a wond'rous fate I'm forced to rove,While the blessings and the chaunting sounds

　　That your priests delight in, useless prove.

　　Water, salt, are vain

　　Fervent youth to chain,

　　Ah, e'en Earth can never cool down love!

　　"When that infant vow of love was spoken,

　　Venus' radiant temple smiled on both.Mother! thou that promise since hast broken,

　　Fetter'd by a strange, deceitful oath.

　　Gods, though, hearken ne'er,

　　Should a mother swear

　　To deny her daughter's plighted troth.

　　From my grave to wander I am forc'd,

　　Still to seek The Good's long-sever'd link,Still to love the bridegroom I have lost,

　　And the life-blood of his heart to drink;

　　When his race is run,

　　I must hasten on,

　　And the young must 'neath my vengeance sink,

　　"Beauteous youth! no longer mayst thou live;

　　Here must shrivel up thy form so fair;Did not I to thee a token give,

　　Taking in return this lock of hair?

　　View it to thy sorrow!

　　Grey thoult be to-morrow,

　　Only to grow brown again when there.

　　"Mother, to this final prayer give ear!

　　Let a funeral pile be straightway dress'd;Open then my cell so sad and drear,

　　That the flames may give the lovers rest!

　　When ascends the fire

　　From the glowing pyre,

　　To the gods of old we'll hasten, blest."

　　1797.-----THE GOD AND THE BAYADERE.

　　AN INDIAN LEGEND.

　　[This very fine Ballad was also first given in the Horen.](MAHADEVA is one of the numerous names of Seeva, the destroyer,--the great god of the Brahmins.)

　　MAHADEVA,* Lord of earth

　　For the sixth time comes below,

　　As a man of mortal birth,--

　　Like him, feeling joy and woe.

　　Hither loves he to repair,

　　And his power behind to leave;

　　If to punish or to spare,

　　Men as man he'd fain perceive.And when he the town as a trav'ller hath seen,Observing the mighty, regarding the mean,He quits it, to go on his journey, at eve.

　　He was leaving now the place,

　　When an outcast met his eyes,--

　　Fair in form, with painted face,--

　　Where some straggling dwellings rise.

　　"Maiden, hail!"--"Thanks! welcome here!

　　Stay!--I'll join thee in the road.'

　　"Who art thou?"--"A Bayadere,

　　And this house is love's abode."The cymbal she hastens to play for the dance,Well skill'd in its mazes the sight to entrance,Then by her with grace is the nosegay bestow'd.

　　Then she draws him, as in play,

　　O'er the threshold eagerly:

　　"Beauteous stranger, light as day

　　Thou shalt soon this cottage see.

　　I'll refresh thee, if thou'rt tired,

　　And will bathe thy weary feet;

　　Take whate'er by thee's desired,

　　Toying, rest, or rapture sweet."--She busily seeks his feign'd suff'rings to ease;Then smiles the Immortal; with pleasure he seesThat with kindness a heart so corrupted can beat.

　　And he makes her act the part

　　Of a slave; he's straight obey'd.

　　What at first had been but art,

　　Soon is nature in the maid.

　　By degrees the fruit we find,

　　Where the buds at first obtain;

　　When obedience fills the mind,

　　Love will never far remain.But sharper and sharper the maiden to prove,The Discerner of all things below and above,Feigns pleasure, and horror, and maddening pain.

　　And her painted cheeks he kisses,

　　And his vows her heart enthrall;

　　Feeling love's sharp pangs and blisses,

　　Soon her tears begin to fall.

　　At his feet she now must sink,

　　Not with thoughts of lust or gain,--

　　And her slender members shrink,

　　And devoid of power remain.And so the bright hours with gladness prepareTheir dark, pleasing veil of a texture so fair,And over the couch softly, tranquilly reign.

　　Late she falls asleep, thus bless'd,--

　　Early wakes, her slumbers fled,

　　And she finds the much-loved guest

　　On her bosom lying dead.

　　Screaming falls she on him there,

　　But, alas, too late to save!

　　And his rigid limbs they bear

　　Straightway to their fiery grave.Then hears she the priests and the funeral song,Then madly she runs, and she severs the throng:"Why press tow'rd the pile thus? Why scream thus, and rave?"

　　Then she sinks beside his bier,

　　And her screams through air resound:

　　"I must seek my spouse so dear,

　　E'en if in the grave he's bound.

　　Shall those limbs of grace divine

　　Fall to ashes in my sight?

　　Mine he was! Yes, only mine!

　　Ah, one single blissful night!"The priests chaunt in chorus: "We bear out the old,When long they've been weary, and late they've grown cold:We bear out the young, too, so thoughtless and light.

　　"To thy priests' commands give ear!

　　This one was thy husband ne'er;

　　Live still as a Bayadere,

　　And no duty thou need'st share.

　　To deaths silent realms from life,

　　None but shades attend man's frame,

　　With the husband, none but wife,--

　　That is duty, that is fame.Ye trumpets, your sacred lament haste to raiseOh, welcome, ye gods, the bright lustre of days!Oh, welcome to heaven the youth from the flame!"

　　Thus increased her torments are

　　By the cruel, heartless quire;

　　And with arms outstretching far

　　Leaps she on the glowing pyre.

　　But the youth divine outsprings

　　From the flame with heav'nly grace,

　　And on high his flight he wings,

　　While his arms his love embrace.In the sinner repentant the Godhead feels joy;Immortals delight thus their might to employ.Lost children to raise to a heavenly place.

　　1797.-----THE PARIAH.

　　I.  THE PARIAH S PRAYER.

　　DREADED Brama, lord of might!

　　All proceed from thee alone;Thou art he who judgeth right!

　　Dost thou none but Brahmins own?Do but Rajahs come from thee?

　　None but those of high estate?

　　Didst not thou the ape create,Aye, and even such as we?

　　We are not of noble kind,

　　For with woe our lot is rife;And what others deadly find

　　Is our only source of life.Let this be enough for men,

　　Let them, if they will, despise us;

　　But thou, Brama, thou shouldst prize us,All are equal in thy ken.

　　Now that, Lord, this prayer is said,

　　As thy child acknowledge me;Or let one be born in-stead,

　　Who may link me on to thee!Didst not thou a Bayadere

　　As a goddess heavenward raise?

　　And we too to swell thy praise,Such a miracle would hear.

　　1821.-----II. LEGEND.

　　[The successful manner in which Goethe employs the simplerhymeless trochaic metre in this and in many other Poems willperhaps be remarked by the reader.]

　　WATER-FETCHING goes the nobleBrahmin's wife, so pure and lovely;He is honour'd, void of blemish.And of justice rigid, stern.Daily from the sacred riverBrings she back refreshments precious;--But where is the pail and pitcher?She of neither stands in need.For with pure heart, hands unsullied,She the water lifts, and rolls itTo a wondrous ball of crystalThis she bears with gladsome bosom,Modestly, with graceful motion,To her husband in the house.

　　She to-day at dawn of morningPraying comes to Ganges' waters,Bends her o'er the glassy surface--Sudden, in the waves reflected,Flying swiftly far above her,From the highest heavens descending,She discerns the beauteous formOf a youth divine, createdBy the God's primeval wisdomIn his own eternal breast.

　　When she sees him, straightway feels sheWondrous, new, confused sensationsIn her inmost, deepest being;Fain she'd linger o'er the vision,Then repels it,--it returneth,--And, perplex'd, she bends her flood-wardsWith uncertain hands to draw it;But, alas, she draws no more!For the water's sacred billowsSeem to fly, to hasten from her;She but sees the fearful chasmOf a whirlpool black disclosed.

　　Arms drop down, and footsteps stumble,Can this be the pathway homewards?Shall she fly, or shall she tarry?Can she think, when thought and counsel,When assistance all are lost?So before her spouse appears she--On her looks he--look is judgment--Proudly on the sword he seizes,To the hill of death he drags her,Where delinquents' blood pays forfeit.What resistance could she offer?What excuses could she proffer,Guilty, knowing not her guilt?

　　And with bloody sword returns he,Musing, to his silent dwelling,When his son before him stands:"Whose this blood? Oh, father! father!""The delinquent woman's!"--"Never!For upon the sword it dries not,Like the blood of the delinquent;Fresh it flows, as from the wound.Mother! mother! hither hasten!Unjust never was my father,Tell me what he now hath done."--"Silence! silence! hers the blood is!""Whose, my father?"--"Silence! Silence!""What! oh what! my mother's blood!What her crime? What did she? Answer!Now, the sword! the sword now hold I;Thou thy wife perchance might'st slaughter,But my mother might'st not slay!Through the flames the wife is ableHer beloved spouse to follow,And his dear and only motherThrough the sword her faithful son.""Stay! oh stay!" exclaim'd the father:"Yet 'tis time, so hasten, hasten!Join the head upon the body,With the sword then touch the figure,And, alive she'll follow thee."

　　Hastening, he, with breathless wonder,Sees the bodies of two womenLying crosswise, and their heads too;Oh, what horror! which to choose!Then his mother's head he seizes,--Does not kiss it, deadly pale 'tis,--On the nearest headless bodyPuts it quickly, and then blessesWith the sword the pious work.Then the giant form uprises,--From the dear lips of his mother,Lips all god-like--changeless--blissful,Sound these words with horror fraught:"Son, oh son! what overhast'ning!Yonder is thy mother's body,Near it lies the impious headOf the woman who hath fallenVictim to the judgment-sword!To her body I am graftedBy thy hand for endless ages;Wise in counsel, wild in action,I shall be amongst the gods.E'en the heav'nly boy's own image,Though in eye and brow so lovely,Sinking downwards to the bosomMad and raging lust will stir.

　　"'Twill return again for ever,Ever rising, ever sinking,Now obscured, and now transfigur'd,--So great Brama hath ordain'd.He 'twas sent the beauteous pinions,Radiant face and slender membersOf the only God-begotten,That I might be proved and tempted;For from high descends temptation,When the gods ordain it so.And so I, the Brahmin woman,With my head in Heaven reclining,Must experience, as a Pariah,The debasing power of earth.

　　Son, I send thee to thy father!Comfort him! Let no sad penance,Weak delay, or thought of merit,Hold thee in the desert fastWander on through ev'ry nation,Roam abroad throughout all ages,And proclaim to e'en the meanest,That great Brama hears his cry!

　　"None is in his eyes the meanest--He whose limbs are lame and palsied,He whose soul is wildly riven,Worn with sorrow, hopeless, helpless,Be he Brahmin, be he Pariah,If tow'rd heaven he turns his gaze,Will perceive, will learn to know it:Thousand eyes are glowing yonder,Thousand ears are calmly list'ning,From which nought below is hid.

　　"If I to his throne soar upward,If he sees my fearful figureBy his might transform'd to horror,He for ever will lament it,--May it to your good be found!And I now will kindly warn him,And I now will madly tell himWhatsoe'er my mind conceiveth,What within my bosom heaveth.But my thoughts, my inmost feelings--Those a secret shall remain."

　　1821.-----III.  THE PARIAH'S THANKS.

　　MIGHTY Brama, now I'll bless thee!

　　'Tis from thee that worlds proceed!As my ruler I confess thee,

　　For of all thou takest heed.

　　All thy thousand ears thou keepest

　　Open to each child of earth;We, 'mongst mortals sunk the deepest,

　　Have from thee received new birth.

　　Bear in mind the woman's story,

　　Who, through grief, divine became;Now I'll wait to view His glory,

　　Who omnipotence can claim.

　　1821.-----DEATH-LAMENT OF THE NOBLE WIFE OF ASAN AGA.

　　[From the Morlack.)

　　WHAT is yonder white thing in the forest?Is it snow, or can it swans perchance be?Were it snow, ere this it had been melted,Were it swans, they all away had hastend.Snow, in truth, it is not, swans it is not,'Tis the shining tents of Asan Aga.He within is lying, sorely wounded;To him come his mother and his sister;Bashfully his wife delays to come there.When the torment of his wounds had lessen'd,To his faithful wife he sent this message:"At my court no longer dare to tarry,At my court, or e'en amongst my people."

　　When the woman heard this cruel message,Mute and full of sorrow stood that true one.At the doors she hears the feet of horses,And bethinks that Asan comes--her husband,To the tower she springs, to leap thence headlong,Her two darling daughters follow sadly,And whilst weeping bitter tears, exclaim they:These are not our father Asan's horses;'Tis thy brother Pintorowich coming!"

　　So the wife of Asan turns to meet him,Clasps her arms in anguish round her brother:"See thy sister's sad disgrace, oh brother!How I'm banish'd--mother of five children!"Silently her brother from his wallet,Wrapp'd in deep red-silk, and ready written,Draweth forth the letter of divorcement,To return home to her mother's dwelling,Free to be another's wife thenceforward.

　　When the woman saw that mournful letter,Fervently she kiss'd her two sons' foreheads,And her two girls' cheeks with fervour kiss'd she,But she from the suckling in the cradleCould not tear herself, so deep her sorrow!So she's torn thence by her fiery brother,On his nimble steed he lifts her quickly,And so hastens, with the heart-sad woman,Straightway tow'rd his father's lofty dwelling.

　　Short the time was--seven days had pass'd not,--Yet enough 'twas; many mighty princesSought the woman in her widow's-mourning.Sought the woman,--as their wife they sought her.And the mightiest was Imoski's Cadi,And the woman weeping begg'd her brother:By thy life, my brother, I entreat thee,Let me not another's wife be ever,Lest my heart be broken at the imageOf my poor, my dearly-cherish'd children!"

　　To her prayer her brother would not hearken,Fix'd to wed her to Imoski's Cadi.Yet the good one ceaselessly implored him:"Send, at least a letter, oh, my brother,With this message to Imoski's Cadi:'The young widow sends thee friendly greeting;Earnestly she prays thee, through this letter,That, when thou com'st hither, with thy Suatians,A long veil thou'lt bring me, 'neath whose shadowI may hide, when near the house of Asan,And not see my dearly cherish'd orphans.'"

　　Scarcely had the Cadi read this letter,Than he gather'd all his Suatians round him,And then tow'rd the bride his course directed,And the veil she ask'd for, took he with him.

　　Happily they reach'd the princess' dwelling,From the dwelling happily they led her.But when they approach'd the house of Asan,Lo! the children saw from high their mother,And they shouted: "To thy halls return thou!Eat thy supper with thy darling children!"Mournfully the wife of Asan heard it,Tow'rd the Suatian prince then turn'd she, saying:"Let, I pray, the Suatians and the horsesAt the loved ones' door a short time tarry,That I may give presents to my children."

　　And before the loved ones' door they tarried,And she presents gave to her poor children,To the boys gave gold-embroider'd buskins,To the girls gave long and costly dresses,To the suckling, helpless in the cradle,Gave a garment, to be worn hereafter.

　　This aside saw Father Asan Aga,--Sadly cried he to his darling children:"Hither come, ye dear unhappy infants,For your mother's breast is turn'd to iron,Lock'd for ever, closed to all compassion!"

　　When the wife of Asan heard him speak thus,On the ground, all pale and trembling, fell she,And her spirit fled her sorrowing bosom,When she saw her children flying from her.

　　THE festal day hail ye

　　With garlands of pleasure,

　　And dances' soft measure,With rapture commingledAnd sweet choral song.

　　DAMON.

　　Oh, how I yearn from out the crowd to flee!What joy a secret glade would give to me!Amid the throng, the turmoil here,Confined the plain, the breezes e'en appear.

　　CHORUS.

　　Now order it truly,That ev'ry one dulyMay roam and may wander,Now here, and now yonder,

　　The meadows along.

　　[The Chorus retreats gradually, and the song becomes fainter andfainter, till it dies away in the distance.]

　　DAMON.

　　In vain ye call, in vain would lure me on;True my heart speaks,--but with itself alone.

　　And if I may view

　　A blessing-fraught land,

　　The heaven's clear blue,

　　And the plain's verdant hue,

　　Alone I'll rejoice,

　　Undisturbed by man's voice.

　　And there I'll pay homage

　　To womanly merit,

　　Observe it in spirit,

　　In spirit pay homage;

　　To echo alone

　　Shall my secret be known.

　　CHORUS.

　　[Faintly mingling with Damon's song in the distance.]

　　To echo--alone--

　　Shall my secret--be known.--

　　MENALCAS.

　　My friend, why meet I here with thee?

　　Thou hast'nest not to join the festal throng?No longer stay, but come with me,

　　And mingle in the dance and song.

　　DAMON.

　　Thou'rt welcome, friend! but suffer me to roam

　　Where these old beeches hide me from man's view:Love seeks in solitude a home,

　　And homage may retreat there too.

　　MENALCAS.

　　Thou seekest here a spurious fame,

　　And hast a mind to-day to grieve me.Love as thy portion thou mayst claim

　　But homage thou must share with all, believe me!

　　When their voices thousands raise,And the dawn of morning praise,

　　Rapture bringing,

　　Blithely singing

　　On before us,Heart and ear in pleasure vie;

　　And when thousands join in chorus,

　　With the feelings brightly glowing,

　　And the wishes overflowing,Forcibly they'll bear thee high.

　　[The Chorus gradually approaches, from the distance.]

　　DAMON.

　　Distant strains are hither wending,

　　And I'm gladden'd by the throng;Yes, they're coming,--yes, descending

　　To the valley from the height,

　　MENALCAS.

　　Let us haste, our footsteps blending

　　With the rhythm of the song!Yes, they come; their course they're bending

　　Tow'rd the wood's green sward so bright.

　　CHORUS.[Gradually becoming louder.]

　　Yes, we hither come, attending

　　With the harmony of song,As the hours their race are ending

　　On this day of blest delight.

　　ALL.

　　Let none revealThe thoughts we feel,The aims we own!Let joy alone

　　Disclose the story!She'll prove it rightAnd her delight

　　Includes the glory,Includes the blissOf days like this!

　　1813.-----RINALDO.*

　　[This Cantata was written for Prince Frederick of Gotha, and setto music by Winter, the Prince singing the part of Rinaldo.--Seethe Annalen.]

　　(* See Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata, Canto XVI.)

　　CHORUS.

　　To the strand! quick, mount the bark!

　　If no favouring zephyrs blow,

　　Ply the oar and nimbly row,And with zeal your prowess mark!

　　O'er the sea we thus career.

　　RINALDO.

　　Oh, let me linger one short moment here!'Tis heaven's decree, I may not hence away.The rugged cliffs, the wood-encircled bay,Hold me a prisoner, and my flight delay.

　　Ye were so fair, but now that dream is o'er;The charms of earth, the charms of heaven are nought.What keeps me in this spot so terror-fraught?

　　My only joy is fled for evermore.

　　Let me taste those days so sweet,

　　Heav'n-descended, once again!Heart, dear heart! ay, warmly beat!

　　Spirit true, recall those days

　　Freeborn breath thy gentle lays

　　Mingled are with joy and pain.

　　Round the beds, so richly gleaming,

　　Rises up a palace fair;All with rosy fragrance teeming,

　　As in dream thou saw'st it ne'er.

　　And this spacious garden round,

　　Far extend the galleries;Roses blossom near the ground,

　　High in air, too, bloom the trees.

　　Wat'ry flakes and jets are falling.

　　Sweet and silv'ry strains arise;While the turtle-dove is calling,

　　And the nightingale replies.

　　CHORUS.

　　Gently come! feel no alarm,

　　On a noble duty bent;Vanish'd now is ev'ry charm

　　That by magic power was lent.Friendly words and greetings calmOn his wounds will pour soft balm.

　　Fill his mind with sweet content.

　　RINALDO.

　　Hark! the turtle-dove is calling,

　　And the nightingale replies;Wat'ry flakes and jets are falling,

　　Mingling with their melodies.

　　But all of them say:

　　Her only we mean;But all fly away,

　　As soon as she's seen,--The beauteous young maiden,

　　With graces so rife,

　　Then lily and rose

　　In wreaths are entwining;

　　In dancing combining,Each zephyr that blows

　　Its brother is greeting,

　　All flying and meeting,With balsam full laden,

　　When waken'd to life.

　　CHORUS.

　　No! no longer may we wait;Rouse him from his vision straight!Show the adamantine shield!

　　RINALDO.

　　Woe! what form is here reveal'd!

　　CHORUS.

　　'Twill disclose the cheat to thee.

　　RINALDO.

　　Am I doom'd myself to seeThus degraded evermore?

　　CHORUS.

　　Courage take, and all is o'er.

　　RINALDO.

　　Be it so! I'll take fresh heart,From the spot beloved depart,Leave Armida once again,--Come then! here no more remain.

　　CHORUS.

　　Yes, 'tis well! no more remain.

　　SEMI-CHORUS.

　　Away then! let's fly

　　O'er the zephyr-kiss'd ocean!The soul-lighted eye

　　Sees armies in motion,See proud banners wave

　　O'er the dust-sprinkled course.

　　CHORUS.

　　From his forefathers brave

　　Draws the hero new force.

　　RINALDO.

　　With sorrow laden,

　　Within this valley's

　　All-silent alleysThe fairest maiden

　　Again I see.

　　Twice can this be?What! shall I hear it,And not have spiritTo ease her pains?

　　CHORUS.

　　Unworthy chains?

　　RINALDO.

　　And now I've see her,

　　Alas! how changed!With cold demeanour.

　　And looks estranged,With ghostly tread,--All hope is fled,Yes, fled for ever.The lightnings quiver,Each palace falls;The godlike halls,Each joyous hourOf spirit-power,With love's sweet dayAll fade away!

　　CHORUS.

　　Yes, fade away!

　　SEMI-CHORUS.

　　Already are heard

　　The prayers of the pious.

　　Why longer deny us?The favouring zephyr

　　Forbids all delay.

　　CHORUS.

　　Away, then! away!

　　RINALDO.

　　With heart sadly stirr'd,

　　Your command I receive;

　　Ye force me to leave.Unkind is the zephyr,--

　　Oh, wherefore not stay?

　　CHORUS.

　　Away, then! away!

　　1811.-----THE FIRST WALPURGIS-NIGHT.

　　A DRUID.

　　SWEET smiles the May!

　　The forest gay

　　From frost and ice is freed;

　　No snow is found,

　　Glad songs resound

　　Across the verdant mead.

　　Upon the height

　　The snow lies light,

　　Yet thither now we go,There to extol our Father's name,

　　Whom we for ages know.Amid the smoke shall gleam the flame;

　　Thus pure the heart will grow.

　　THE DRUIDS.

　　Amid the smoke shall gleam the flame;Extol we now our Father's name,

　　Whom we for ages know!

　　Up, up, then, let us go!

　　ONE OF THE PEOPLE.

　　Would ye, then, so rashly act?Would ye instant death attract?Know ye not the cruel threats

　　Of the victors we obey?Round about are placed their nets

　　In the sinful heathen's way.Ah! upon the lofty wall

　　Wife and children slaughter they;And we allHasten to a certain fall.

　　CHORUS OF WOMEN.

　　Ay, upon the camp's high wall

　　All our children loved they slay.

　　Ah, what cruel victors they!And we allHasten to a certain fall.

　　A DRUID.

　　Who fears to-day

　　His rites to pay,

　　Deserves his chains to wear.

　　The forest's free!

　　This wood take we,

　　And straight a pile prepare!

　　Yet in the wood

　　To stay 'tis good

　　By day, till all is still,With watchers all around us plac'd

　　Protecting you from ill.With courage fresh, then let us haste

　　Our duties to fulfil.

　　CHORUS OF WATCHERS.

　　Ye valiant watchers, now divideYour numbers through the forest wide,

　　And see that all is still,

　　While they their rites fulfil.

　　A WATCHER.

　　Let us in a cunning wise,Yon dull Christian priests surpriseWith the devil of their talk

　　We'll those very priests confound.Come with prong, and come with fork.

　　Raise a wild and rattling soundThrough the livelong night, and prowl

　　All the rocky passes round.Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!

　　CHORUS OF WATCHERS.

　　Come with prong, and come with fork,Like the devil of their talk,And with wildly rattling sound,Prowl the desert rocks around!Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!

　　A DRUID.

　　Thus far 'tis right.

　　That we by night

　　Our Father's praises sing;

　　Yet when 'tis day,

　　To Thee we may

　　A heart unsullied bring.

　　'Tis true that now,

　　And often, Thou

　　Fav'rest the foe in fight.As from the smoke is freed the blaze,

　　So let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,

　　Who e'er can crush Thy light?

　　A CHRISTIAN WATCHER.

　　Comrades, quick! your aid afford!All the brood of hell's abroad;See how their enchanted forms

　　Through and through with flames are glowing!Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms,

　　On in quick succession going!Let us, let us haste to fly!

　　Wilder yet the sounds are growing,And the archfiend roars on high;From the groundHellish vapours rise around.

　　CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN WATCHERS.

　　Terrible enchanted forms,Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms!Wilder yet the sounds are growing!See, the archfiend comes, all-glowing!From the groundHellish vapours rise around!

　　CHORUS OF DRUIDS.

　　As from the smoke is freed the blaze,

　　So let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,

　　Who e'er can crush Thy light?

　　1799.-----

　　ODES.

　　-----

　　THESE are the most singular of all the Poems of Goethe, and tomany will appear so wild and fantastic, as to leave anything buta pleasing impression. Those at the beginning, addressed to hisfriend Behrisch, were written at the age of eighteen, and most ofthe remainder were composed while he was still quite young.Despite, however, the extravagance of some of them, such as theWinter Journey over the Hartz Mountains, and the Wanderer'sStorm-Song, nothing can be finer than the noble one entitledMahomet's Song, and others, such as the Spirit Song' over theWaters, The God-like, and, above all, the magnificent sketch ofPrometheus, which forms part of an unfinished piece bearing thesame name, and called by Goethe a 'Dramatic Fragment.'

　　TO MY FRIEND.

　　[These three Odes are addressed to a certain Behrisch, who wastutor to Count Lindenau, and of whom Goethe gives an odd accountat the end of the Seventh Book of his Autobiography.]

　　FIRST ODE.

　　TRANSPLANT the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;A happier resting-placeIts trunk deserved.

　　Yet the strength of its natureTo Earth's exhausting avarice,To Air's destructive inroads,An antidote opposed.

　　See how it in springtimeCoins its pale green leaves!Their orange-fragrancePoisons each flyblow straight.

　　The caterpillar's toothIs blunted by them;With silv'ry hues they gleamIn the bright sunshine,

　　Its twigs the maidenFain would twine inHer bridal-garland;Youths its fruit are seeking.

　　See, the autumn cometh!The caterpillarSighs to the crafty spider,--Sighs that the tree will not fade.

　　Hov'ring thitherFrom out her yew-tree dwelling,The gaudy foe advancesAgainst the kindly tree,

　　And cannot hurt it,But the more artful oneDefiles with nauseous venomIts silver leaves;

　　And sees with triumphHow the maiden shudders,The youth, how mourns he,On passing by.

　　Transplant the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;Tree, thank the gardenerWho moves thee hence!

　　1767.-----SECOND ODE.

　　THOU go'st! I murmur--Go! let me murmur.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!

　　Deadly marshes,Steaming mists of OctoberHere interweave their currents,Blending for ever.

　　Noisome insectsHere are engender'd;Fatal darknessVeils their malice.

　　The fiery-tongued serpent,Hard by the sedgy bank,Stretches his pamper'd body,Caress'd by the sun's bright beams.

　　Tempt no gentle night-ramblesUnder the moon's cold twilight!Loathsome toads hold their meetingsYonder at every crossway.

　　Injuring not,Fear will they cause thee.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!

　　1767.-----THIRD ODE.

　　BE void of feeling!A heart that soon is stirr'd,Is a possession sadUpon this changing earth.

　　Behrisch, let spring's sweet smileNever gladden thy brow!Then winter's gloomy tempestsNever will shadow it o'er.

　　Lean thyself ne'er on a maiden'sSorrow-engendering breast.Ne'er on the arm,Misery-fraught, of a friend.

　　Already envyFrom out his rocky ambushUpon thee turnsThe force of his lynx-like eyes,

　　Stretches his talons,On thee falls,In thy shouldersCunningly plants them.

　　Strong are his skinny arms,As panther-claws;He shaketh thee,And rends thy frame.

　　Death 'tis to part,'Tis threefold deathTo part, not hopingEver to meet again.

　　Thou wouldst rejoice to leaveThis hated land behind,Wert thou not chain'd to meWith friendships flowery chains.

　　Burst them! I'll not repine.No noble friendWould stay his fellow-captive,If means of flight appear.

　　The remembranceOf his dear friend's freedomGives him freedomIn his dungeon.

　　Thou go'st,--I'm left.But e'en alreadyThe last year's winged spokesWhirl round the smoking axle.

　　I number the turnsOf the thundering wheel;The last one I bless.--Each bar then is broken, I'm free then as thou!

　　1767.-----MAHOMET'S SONG.

　　[This song was intended to be introduced in a dramatic poementitled Mahomet, the plan of which was not carried out byGoethe. He mentions that it was to have been sung by Ali towardsthe end of the piece, in honor of his master, Mahomet, shortlybefore his death, and when at the height of his glory, of whichit is typical.]

　　SEE the rock-born stream!Like the gleamOf a star so brightKindly spiritsHigh above the cloudsNourished him while youthfulIn the copse between the cliffs.

　　Young and fresh.From the clouds he dancethDown upon the marble rocks;Then tow'rd heavenLeaps exulting.

　　Through the mountain-passesChaseth he the colour'd pebbles,And, advancing like a chief,Tears his brother streamlets with himIn his course.

　　In the valley down below'Neath his footsteps spring the flowers,And the meadowIn his breath finds life.

　　Yet no shady vale can stay him,Nor can flowers,Round his knees all-softly twiningWith their loving eyes detain him;To the plain his course he taketh,Serpent-winding,

　　Social streamletsJoin his waters. And now moves heO'er the plain in silv'ry glory,And the plain in him exults,And the rivers from the plain,And the streamlets from the mountain,Shout with joy, exclaiming: "Brother,Brother, take thy brethren with thee,With thee to thine aged father,To the everlasting ocean,Who, with arms outstretching far,Waiteth for us;Ah, in vain those arms lie openTo embrace his yearning children;For the thirsty sand consumes usIn the desert waste; the sunbeamsDrink our life-blood; hills around usInto lakes would dam us! Brother,Take thy brethren of the plain,Take thy brethren of the mountainWith thee, to thy father's arms!

　　Let all come, then!--And now swells heLordlier still; yea, e'en a peopleBears his regal flood on high!And in triumph onward rolling,Names to countries gives he,--citiesSpring to light beneath his foot.

　　Ever, ever, on he rushes,Leaves the towers' flame-tipp'd summits,Marble palaces, the offspringOf his fullness, far behind.

　　Cedar-houses bears the AtlasOn his giant shoulders; flutt'ringIn the breeze far, far above himThousand flags are gaily floating,Bearing witness to his might.

　　And so beareth he his brethren,All his treasures, all his children,Wildly shouting, to the bosomOf his long-expectant sire.

　　1774.-----SPIRIT SONG OVER THE WATERS.

　　THE soul of manResembleth water:From heaven it cometh,To heaven it soareth.And then againTo earth descendeth,Changing ever.

　　Down from the loftyRocky wallStreams the bright flood,Then spreadeth gentlyIn cloudy billowsO'er the smooth rock,And welcomed kindly,Veiling, on roams it,Soft murmuring,Tow'rd the abyss.

　　Cliffs projectingOppose its progress,--Angrily foams itDown to the bottom,Step by step.

　　Now, in flat channel,Through the meadowland steals it,And in the polish'd lakeEach constellationJoyously peepeth.

　　Wind is the lovingWooer of waters;Wind blends togetherBillows all-foaming.

　　Spirit of man,Thou art like unto water!Fortune of man,Thou art like unto wind!

　　1789.*-----MY GODDESS.

　　SAY, which ImmortalMerits the highest reward?With none contend I,But I will give itTo the aye-changing,Ever-movingWondrous daughter of Jove.His best-beloved offspring.Sweet Phantasy.

　　For unto herHath he grantedAll the fancies which erstTo none allow'd heSaving himself;Now he takes his pleasureIn the mad one.

　　She may, crowned with roses,With staff twined round with lilies,Roam thro' flow'ry valleys,Rule the butterfly-people,And soft-nourishing dewWith bee-like lipsDrink from the blossom:

　　Or else she mayWith fluttering hairAnd gloomy looksSigh in the windRound rocky cliffs,And thousand-hued.Like morn and even.Ever changing,Like moonbeam's light,To mortals appear.

　　Let us all, then,Adore the Father!The old, the mighty,Who such a beauteousNe'er-fading spouseDeigns to accordTo perishing mortals!

　　To us aloneDoth he unite her,With heavenly bonds,While he commands her,in joy and sorrow,As a true spouseNever to fly us.

　　All the remainingRaces so poorOf life-teeming earth.In children so rich.Wander and feedIn vacant enjoyment,And 'mid the dark sorrowsOf evanescentRestricted life,--Bow'd by the heavyYoke of Necessity.

　　But unto us heHath his most versatile,Most cherished daughterGranted,--what joy!

　　Lovingly greet herAs a beloved one!Give her the woman'sPlace in our home!

　　And oh, may the agedStepmother WisdomHer gentle spiritNe'er seek to harm!

　　Yet know I her sister,The older, sedater,Mine own silent friend;Oh, may she never,Till life's lamp is quench'd,Turn away from me,--That noble inciter,Comforter,--Hope!

　　1781.-----WINTER JOURNEY OVER THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS.

　　[The following explanation is necessary, in order to make thisode in any way intelligible. The Poet is supposed to leave hiscompanions, who are proceeding on a hunting expedition in winter,in order himself to pay a visit to a hypochondriacal friend, andalso to see the mining in the Hartz mountains. The odealternately describes, in a very fragmentary and peculiar manner,the naturally happy disposition of the Poet himself and theunhappiness of his friend; it pictures the wildness of the roadand the dreariness of the prospect, which is relieved at one spotby the distant sight of a town, a very vague allusion to which ismade in the third strophe; it recalls the hunting party on whichhis companions have gone; and after an address to Love, concludesby a contrast between the unexplored recesses of the highest peakof the Hartz and the metalliferous veins of its smallerbrethren.]

　　LIKE the vultureWho on heavy morning cloudsWith gentle wing reposingLooks for his prey,--Hover, my song!

　　For a God hathUnto each prescribedHis destined path,Which the happy oneRuns o'er swiftlyTo his glad goal:He whose heart cruelFate hath contracted,Struggles but vainlyAgainst all the barriersThe brazen thread raises,But which the harsh shearsMust one day sever.

　　Through gloomy thicketsPresseth the wild deer on,And with the sparrowsLong have the wealthySettled themselves in the marsh.

　　Easy 'tis following the chariotThat by Fortune is driven,Like the baggage that movesOver well-mended highwaysAfter the train of a prince.

　　But who stands there apart?In the thicket, lost is his path;Behind him the bushesAre closing together,The grass springs up again,The desert engulphs him.

　　Ah, who'll heal his afflictions,To whom balsam was poison,Who, from love's fullness,Drank in misanthropy only?First despised, and now a despiser,He, in secret, wastethAll that he is worth,In a selfishness vain.If there be, on thy psaltery,Father of Love, but one toneThat to his ear may be pleasing,Oh, then, quicken his heart!Clear his cloud-enveloped eyesOver the thousand fountainsClose by the thirsty oneIn the desert.

　　Thou who createst much joy,For each a measure o'erflowing,Bless the sons of the chaseWhen on the track of the prey,With a wild thirsting for blood,Youthful and joyousAvenging late the injusticeWhich the peasant resistedVainly for years with his staff.

　　But the lonely one veilWithin thy gold clouds!Surround with winter-green,Until the roses bloom again,The humid locks,Oh Love, of thy minstrel!

　　With thy glimmering torchLightest thou himThrough the fords when 'tis night,Over bottomless placesOn desert-like plains;With the thousand colours of morningGladd'nest his bosom;With the fierce-biting stormBearest him proudly on high;Winter torrents rush from the cliffs,--Blend with his psalms;An altar of grateful delightHe finds in the much-dreaded mountain'sSnow-begirded summit,Which foreboding nationsCrown'd with spirit-dances.

　　Thou stand'st with breast inscrutable,Mysteriously disclosed,High o'er the wondering world,And look'st from cloudsUpon its realms and its majesty,Which thou from the veins of thy brethrenNear thee dost water.

　　1777.-----TO FATHER* KRONOS.

　　[written in a post-chaise.]

　　(* In the original, Schwager, which has the twofold meaning ofbrother-in-law and postilion.)

　　HASTEN thee, Kronos!On with clattering trotDownhill goeth thy path;Loathsome dizziness ever,When thou delayest, assails me.Quick, rattle along,Over stock and stone let thy trotInto life straightway lead

　　Now once moreUp the toilsome ascentHasten, panting for breath!Up, then, nor idle be,--Striving and hoping, up, up!

　　Wide, high, glorious the viewGazing round upon life,While from mount unto mountHovers the spirit eterne,Life eternal foreboding.

　　Sideways a roof's pleasant shadeAttracts thee,And a look that promises coolnessOn the maidenly threshold.There refresh thee! And, maiden,Give me this foaming draught also,Give me this health-laden look!

　　Down, now! quicker still, down!See where the sun setsEre he sets, ere old ageSeizeth me in the morass,Ere my toothless jaws mumble,And my useless limbs totter;While drunk with his farewell beamHurl me,--a fiery seaFoaming still in mine eye,--Hurl me, while dazzled and reeling,Down to the gloomy portal of hell.

　　Blow, then, gossip, thy horn,Speed on with echoing trot,So that Orcus may know we are coming;So that our host may with joyWait at the door to receive us.

　　1774.-----THE WANDERER'S STORM-SONG.

　　[Goethe says of this ode, that it is the only one remaining outof several strange hymns and dithyrambs composed by him at aperiod of great unhappiness, when the love-affair between him andFrederica had been broken off by him. He used to sing them whilewandering wildly about the country. This particular one wascaused by his being caught in a tremendous storm on one of theseoccasions. He calls it a half-crazy piece (halkunsinn), and thereader will probably agree with him.]

　　He whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Feels no dread within his heartAt the tempest or the rain.He whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Will to the rain-clouds,Will to the hailstorm,Sing in replyAs the lark sings,Oh thou on high!

　　Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt raise above the mud-trackWith thy fiery pinions.He will wander,As, with flowery feet,Over Deucalion's dark flood,Python-slaying, light, glorious,Pythius Apollo.

　　Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt place upon thy fleecy pinionWhen he sleepeth on the rock,--Thou wilt shelter with thy guardian wingIn the forest's midnight hour.

　　Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt wrap up warmlyIn the snow-drift;Tow'rd the warmth approach the Muses,Tow'rd the warmth approach the Graces.

　　Ye Muses, hover round me!Ye Graces also!That is water, that is earth,And the son of water and of earthOver which I wander,Like the gods.

　　Ye are pure, like the heart of the water,Ye are pure like the marrow of earth,Hov'ring round me, while I hoverOver water, o'er the earthLike the gods.

　　Shall he, then, return,The small, the dark, the fiery peasant?Shall he, then, return, waitingOnly thy gifts, oh Father Bromius,And brightly gleaming, warmth-spreading fire?Return with joy?And I, whom ye attended,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Whom all awaits that ye,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Of circling bliss in lifeHave glorified--shall IReturn dejected?

　　Father Bromius!Thourt the Genius,Genius of ages,Thou'rt what inward glowTo Pindar was,What to the worldPhoebus Apollo.

　　Woe! Woe Inward warmth,Spirit-warmth,Central-point!Glow, and vie withPhoebus Apollo!Coldly soonHis regal lookOver thee will swiftly glide,--

　　Envy-struckLinger o'er the cedar's strength,Which, to flourish,Waits him not.

　　Why doth my lay name thee the last?Thee, from whom it began,Thee, in whom it endeth,Thee, from whom it flows,Jupiter Pluvius!Tow'rd thee streams my song.And a Castalian springRuns as a fellow-brook,Runs to the idle ones,Mortal, happy ones,Apart from thee,Who cov'rest me around,Jupiter Pluvius!

　　Not by the elm-treeHim didst thou visit,With the pair of dovesHeld in his gentle arm,--With the beauteous garland of roses,--Caressing him, so blest in his flowers,Anacreon,Storm-breathing godhead!Not in the poplar grove,Near the Sybaris' strand,Not on the mountain'sSun-illumined browDidst thou seize him,The flower-singing,Honey-breathing,Sweetly noddingTheocritus.

　　When the wheels were rattling,Wheel on wheel tow'rd the goal,High aroseThe sound of the lashOf youths with victory glowing,In the dust rolling,As from the mountain fallShowers of stones in the vale--Then thy soul was brightly glowing, Pindar--Glowing? Poor heart!

　　There, on the hill,--Heavenly might!But enough glowThither to wend,Where is my cot!

　　1771.-----THE SEA-VOYAGE.

　　MANY a day and night my bark stood ready laden;Waiting fav'ring winds, I sat with true friends round me,Pledging me to patience and to courage,In the haven.

　　And they spoke thus with impatience twofold:"Gladly pray we for thy rapid passage,Gladly for thy happy voyage; fortuneIn the distant world is waiting for thee,In our arms thoult find thy prize, and love too,When returning."

　　And when morning came, arose an uproar,And the sailors' joyous shouts awoke us;All was stirring, all was living, moving,Bent on sailing with the first kind zephyr.

　　And the sails soon in the breeze are swelling,And the sun with fiery love invites us;Fill'd the sails are, clouds on high are floating,On the shore each friend exulting raisesSongs of hope, in giddy joy expectingJoy the voyage through, as on the morn of sailing,And the earliest starry nights so radiant.

　　But by God-sent changing winds ere long he's drivenSideways from the course he had intended,And he feigns as though he would surrender,While he gently striveth to outwit them,

　　To his goal, e'en when thus press'd, still faithful.But from out the damp grey distance rising,Softly now the storm proclaims its advent,Presseth down each bird upon the waters,Presseth down the throbbing hearts of mortals.And it cometh. At its stubborn fury,Wisely ev'ry sail the seaman striketh;With the anguish-laden ball are sportingWind and water.

　　And on yonder shore are gather'd standing,Friends and lovers, trembling for the bold one:"Why, alas, remain'd he here not with us!Ah, the tempest! Cast away by fortune!Must the good one perish in this fashion?Might not he perchance.... Ye great immortals!"

　　Yet he, like a man, stands by his rudder;With the bark are sporting wind and water,Wind and water sport not with his bosom:On the fierce deep looks he, as a master,--In his gods, or shipwreck'd, or safe landed,Trusting ever.

　　1776.-----THE EAGLE AND DOVE.

　　IN search of prey once raised his pinionsAn eaglet;A huntsman's arrow came, and reftHis right wing of all motive power.Headlong he fell into a myrtle grove,For three long days on anguish fed,In torment writhedThroughout three long, three weary nights;And then was cured,Thanks to all-healing Nature'sSoft, omnipresent balm.He crept away from out the copse,And stretch'd his wing--alas!Lost is all power of flight--He scarce can lift himselfFrom off the groundTo catch some mean, unworthy prey,And rests, deep-sorrowing,On the low rock beside the stream.Up to the oak he looks,Looks up to heaven,While in his noble eye there gleams a tear.Then, rustling through the myrtle boughs, behold,There comes a wanton pair of doves,Who settle down, and, nodding, strutO'er the gold sands beside the stream,And gradually approach;Their red-tinged eyes, so full of love,Soon see the inward-sorrowing one.The male, inquisitively social, leapsOn the next bush, and looksUpon him kindly and complacently."Thou sorrowest," murmurs he:"Be of good cheer, my friend!All that is needed for calm happinessHast thou not here?Hast thou not pleasure in the golden boughThat shields thee from the day's fierce glow?Canst thou not raise thy breast to catch,On the soft moss beside the brook,The sun's last rays at even?Here thou mayst wander through the flowers' fresh dew,Pluck from the overflowThe forest-trees provide,Thy choicest food,--mayst quenchThy light thirst at the silvery spring.Oh friend, true happinessLies in contentedness,And that contentednessFinds everywhere enough.""Oh, wise one!" said the eagle, while he sankIn deep and ever deep'ning thought--"Oh Wisdom! like a dove thou speakest!"

　　1774.*-----PROMETHEUS.

　　COVER thy spacious heavens, Zeus,With clouds of mist,And, like the boy who lopsThe thistles' heads,Disport with oaks and mountain-peaks,Yet thou must leaveMy earth still standing;My cottage too, which was not raised by thee;Leave me my hearth,Whose kindly glowBy thee is envied.

　　I know nought poorerUnder the sun, than ye gods!Ye nourish painfully,With sacrificesAnd votive prayers,Your majesty:Ye would e'en starve,If children and beggarsWere not trusting fools.

　　While yet a childAnd ignorant of life,I turned my wandering gazeUp tow'rd the sun, as if with himThere were an ear to hear my wailings,A heart, like mine,To feel compassion for distress.

　　Who help'd meAgainst the Titans' insolence?Who rescued me from certain death,From slavery?Didst thou not do all this thyself,My sacred glowing heart?And glowedst, young and good,Deceived with grateful thanksTo yonder slumbering one?

　　I honour thee! and why?Hast thou e'er lighten'd the sorrowsOf the heavy laden?Hast thou e'er dried up the tearsOf the anguish-stricken?Was I not fashion'd to be a manBy omnipotent Time,And by eternal Fate,Masters of me and thee?

　　Didst thou e'er fancyThat life I should learn to hate,And fly to deserts,Because not allMy blossoming dreams grew ripe?

　　Here sit I, forming mortalsAfter my image;A race resembling me,To suffer, to weep,To enjoy, to be glad,And thee to scorn,As I!

　　1773.-----GANYMEDE.

　　How, in the light of morning,Round me thou glowest,Spring, thou beloved one!With thousand-varying loving blissThe sacred emotionsBorn of thy warmth eternalPress 'gainst my bosom,Thou endlessly fair one!Could I but hold thee clasp'dWithin mine arms!

　　Ah! upon thy bosomLay I, pining,And then thy flowers, thy grass,Were pressing against my heart.Thou coolest the burningThirst of my bosom,Beauteous morning breeze!The nightingale then calls meSweetly from out of the misty vale.I come, I come!Whither? Ah, whither?

　　Up, up, lies my course.While downward the cloudsAre hovering, the cloudsAre bending to meet yearning love.For me,Within thine armsUpwards!Embraced and embracing!Upwards into thy bosom,Oh Father all-loving!

　　1789.*-----THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMANITY.

　　WHEN the primevalAll-holy FatherSows with a tranquil handFrom clouds, as they roll,Bliss-spreading lightningsOver the earth,Then do I kiss the lastHem of his garment,While by a childlike aweFiil'd is my breast.

　　For with immortalsNe'er may a mortalMeasure himself.If he soar upwardsAnd if he touchWith his forehead the stars,Nowhere will rest thenHis insecure feet,And with him sportTempest and cloud.

　　Though with firm sinewyLimbs he may standOn the enduringWell-grounded earth,All he is everAble to do,Is to resembleThe oak or the vine.

　　Wherein do godsDiffer from mortals?In that the formerSee endless billowsHeaving before them;Us doth the billowLift up and swallow,So that we perish.

　　Small is the ringEnclosing our life,And whole generationsLink themselves firmlyOn to existence'sChain never-ending.

　　1789. *-----THE GODLIKE.

　　NOBLE be man,Helpful and good!For that aloneDistinguisheth himFrom all the beingsUnto us known.

　　Hail to the beings,Unknown and glorious,Whom we forebode!From his exampleLearn we to know them!

　　For unfeelingNature is ever:On bad and on goodThe sun alike shineth;And on the wicked,As on the best,The moon and stars gleam.

　　Tempest and torrent,Thunder and hail,Roar on their path,Seizing the while,As they haste onward,One after another.

　　Even so, fortuneGropes 'mid the throng--Innocent boyhood'sCurly head seizing,--Seizing the hoaryHead of the sinner.

　　After laws mighty,Brazen, eternal,Must all we mortalsFinish the circuitOf our existence.

　　Man, and man onlyCan do the impossible;He 'tis distinguisheth,Chooseth and judgeth;He to the momentEndurance can lend.

　　He and he onlyThe good can reward,The bad can he punish,Can heal and can save;All that wanders and straysCan usefully blend.And we pay homageTo the immortalsAs though they were men,And did in the great,What the best, in the small,Does or might do.

　　Be the man that is noble,Both helpful and good.Unweariedly formingThe right and the useful,A type of those beingsOur mind hath foreshadow'd!

　　MISCELLANEOUS POEMS.

　　-----in the wares before you spread,Types of all things may be read.-----THE GERMAN PARNASSUS.

　　'NEATH the shadow

　　Of these bushes,On the meadow

　　Where the cooling water gushes.Phoebus gave me, when a boy,All life's fullness to enjoy.So, in silence, as the GodBade them with his sov'reign nod,Sacred Muses train'd my daysTo his praise.--With the bright and silv'ry floodOf Parnassus stirr'd my blood,And the seal so pure and chasteBy them on my lips was placed.

　　With her modest pinions, see,Philomel encircles me!In these bushes, in yon grove,

　　Calls she to her sister-throng,

　　And their heavenly choral songTeaches me to dream of love.

　　Fullness waxes in my breastOf emotions social, blest;Friendship's nurturedlove awakes,--And the silence Phoebus breaksOf his mountains, of his vales,Sweetly blow the balmy gales;All for whom he shows affection,Who are worthy his protection,Gladly follow his direction.

　　This one comes with joyous bearing

　　And with open, radiant gaze;That a sterner look is wearing,This one, scarcely cured, with daring

　　Wakes the strength of former days;For the sweet, destructive flamePierced his marrow and his frame.That which Amor stole beforePhoebus only can restore,Peace, and joy, and harmony,Aspirations pure and free.

　　Brethren, rise ye!Numbers prize ye!Deeds of worth resemble they.

　　Who can better than the bardGuide a friend when gone astray?

　　If his duty he regard,More he'll do, than others may.

　　Yes! afar I hear them sing!Yes! I hear them touch the string,And with mighty godlike stroke

　　Right and duty they inspire,And evoke,

　　As they sing, and wake the lyre,Tendencies of noblest worth,To each type of strength give birth.

　　Phantasies of sweetest powerFlowerRound about on ev'ry bough,Bending nowLike the magic wood of old,'Neath the fruit that gleams like gold.

　　What we feel and what we view

　　In the land of highest bliss,--

　　This dear soil, a sun like this,--Lures the best of women too.And the Muses' breathings blestRouse the maiden's gentle breast,Tune the throat to minstrelsy,And with cheeks of beauteous dye,Bid it sing a worthy song,Sit the sister-band among;And their strains grow softer still,As they vie with earnest will.

　　One amongst the band betimes

　　Goes to wanderBy the beeches, 'neath the limes,

　　Yonder seeking, finding yonderThat which in the morning-groveShe had lost through roguish Love,All her breast's first aspirations,And her heart's calm meditations,To the shady wood so fair

　　Gently stealing,Takes she that which man can ne'er

　　Duly merit,--each soft feeling,--Disregards the noontide rayAnd the dew at close of day,?

　　In the plain her path she loses.Ne'er disturb her on her way!

　　Seek her silently, ye Muses

　　Shouts I hear, wherein the soundOf the waterfall is drown'd.From the grove loud clamours rise,Strange the tumult, strange the cries.See I rightly? Can it be?To the very sanctuary,Lo, an impious troop in-hies!

　　O'er the landStreams the band;Hot desire,Drunken-fireIn their gazeWildly plays,--Makes their hairBristle there.And the troop,With fell swoop,Women, men,Coming then,Ply their blowsAnd expose,Void of shame,All the frame.Iron shot,Fierce and hot,Strike with fearOn the ear;All they slayOn their way.O'er the landPours the band;All take flightAt their sight.

　　Ah, o'er ev'ry plant they rush!Ah, their cruel footsteps crushAll the flowers that fill their path!Who will dare to stem their wrath?

　　Brethren, let us venture all!

　　Virtue in your pure cheek glows.Phoebus will attend our call

　　When he sees our heavy woes;And that we may have arightWeapons suited to the fight,He the mountain shaketh now--From its browRattling downStone on stoneThrough the thicket spread appear.Brethren, seize them! Wherefore fear?Now the villain crew assail,As though with a storm of hail,And expel the strangers wildFrom these regions soft and mildWhere the sun has ever smil'd!

　　What strange wonder do I see?Can it be?All my limbs of power are reft.And all strength my hand has left.Can it he?None are strangers that I see!And our brethren 'tis who goOn before, the way to show!Oh, the reckless impious ones!How they, with their jarring tones,Beat the time, as on they hie!Quick, my brethren!--let us fly!

　　To the rash ones, yet a word!Ay, my voice shall now be heard,As a peal of thunder, strong!

　　Words as poets' arms were made,--

　　When the god will he obey'd,Follow fast his darts ere long.

　　Was it possible that yeThus your godlike dignityShould forget? The Thyrsus rude

　　Must a heavy burden feel

　　To the hand but wont to stealO'er the lyre in gentle mood.From the sparkling waterfalls,From the brook that purling calls,Shall Silenus' loathsome beastBe allow'd at will to feast?Aganippe's * wave he sipsWith profane and spreading lips,--With ungainly feet stamps madly,Till the waters flow on sadly.

　　Fain I'd think myself deluded

　　In the sadd'ning sounds I hear;From the holy glades secluded

　　Hateful tones assail the ear.Laughter wild (exchange how mournful!)

　　Takes the place of love's sweet dream;Women-haters and the scornful

　　In exulting chorus scream.Nightingale and turtle dove

　　Fly their nests so warm and chaste,And, inflamed with sensual love,

　　Holds the Faun the Nymph embrac'd.Here a garment's torn away,

　　Scoffs succeed their sated bliss,While the god, with angry ray,

　　Looks upon each impious kiss.

　　Vapour, smoke, as from a fire,

　　And advancing clouds I view;Chords not only grace the lyre,

　　For the bow its chords bath too.Even the adorer's heart

　　Dreads the wild advancing hand,For the flames that round them dart

　　Show the fierce destroyer's hand.

　　Oh neglect not what I say,

　　For I speak it lovingly!From our boundaries haste away,

　　From the god's dread anger fly!Cleanse once more the holy place,

　　Turn the savage train aside!Earth contains upon its face

　　Many a spot unsanctified;Here we only prize the good.

　　Stars unsullied round us burn.

　　If ye, in repentant mood,

　　From your wanderings would return,--If ye fail to find the bliss

　　That ye found with us of yore,--Or when lawless mirth like this

　　Gives your hearts delight no more,--Then return in pilgrim guise,

　　Gladly up the mountain go,While your strains repentant rise,

　　And our brethren's advent show.

　　Let a new-born wreath entwine

　　Solemnly your temples round;Rapture glows in hearts divine

　　When a long-lost sinner's found.Swifter e'en than Lathe's flood

　　Round Death's silent house can play,Ev'ry error of the good

　　Will love's chalice wash away.All will haste your steps to meet,

　　As ye come in majesty,--Men your blessing will entreat;--

　　Ours ye thus will doubly be!

　　1798.(* Aganippe--A spring in Boeotia, which arose out of MountHelicon, and was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.)-----LILY'S MENAGERIE.

　　[Goethe describes this much-admired Poem, which he wrote inhonour of his love Lily, as being "designed to change hissurrender of her into despair, by drolly-fretful images."]

　　THERE'S no menagerie, I vow,

　　Excels my Lily's at this minute;

　　She keeps the strangest creatures in it,And catches them, she knows not how.

　　Oh, how they hop, and run, and rave,And their clipp'd pinions wildly wave,--Poor princes, who must all endureThe pangs of love that nought can cure.

　　What is the fairy's name?--Is't Lily?--Ask not me!Give thanks to Heaven if she's unknown to thee.

　　Oh what a cackling, what a shrieking,

　　When near the door she takes her stand,

　　With her food-basket in her hand!Oh what a croaking, what a squeaking!Alive all the trees and the bushes appear,While to her feet whole troops draw near;The very fish within, the water clearSplash with impatience and their heads protrude;And then she throws around the foodWith such a look!--the very gods delighting(To say nought of beasts). There begins, then, a biting,A picking, a pecking, a sipping,And each o'er the legs of another is tripping,And pushing, and pressing, and flapping,And chasing, and fuming, and snapping,And all for one small piece of bread,To which, though dry, her fair hands give a taste,As though it in ambrosia had been plac'd.

　　And then her look! the tone

　　With which she calls: Pipi! Pipi!Would draw Jove's eagle from his throne;Yes, Venus' turtle doves, I wean,And the vain peacock e'en,Would come, I swear,Soon as that tone had reach'd them through the air.

　　E'en from a forest dark had she

　　Enticed a bear, unlick'd, ill-bred,

　　And, by her wiles alluring, ledTo join the gentle company,Until as tame as they was he:(Up to a certain point, be't understood!)How fair, and, ah, how goodShe seem'd to be! I would have drain'd my bloodTo water e'en her flow'rets sweet.

　　"Thou sayest: I! Who? How? And where?"--Well, to be plain, good Sirs--I am the bear;

　　In a net-apron, caught, alas!

　　Chain'd by a silk-thread at her feet.

　　But how this wonder came to passI'll tell some day, if ye are curious;Just now, my temper's much too furious.

　　Ah, when I'm in the corner plac'd,

　　And hear afar the creatures snapping,

　　And see the flipping and the flapping,

　　I turn around

　　With growling sound,

　　And backward run a step in haste,

　　And look around

　　With growling sound.

　　Then run again a step in haste,And to my former post go round.

　　But suddenly my anger grows,A mighty spirit fills my nose,My inward feelings all revolt.A creature such as thou! a dolt!Pipi, a squirrel able nuts to crack!I bristle up my shaggy backUnused a slave to be.I'm laughed at by each trim and upstart treeTo scorn. The bowling-green I fly,

　　With neatly-mown and well-kept grass:

　　The box makes faces as I pass,--Into the darkest thicket hasten I,Hoping to 'scape from the ring,Over the palings to spring!Vainly I leap and climb;

　　I feel a leaden spell.

　　That pinions me as well,And when I'm fully wearied out in time,I lay me down beside some mock-cascade,

　　And roll myself half dead, and foam, and cry,

　　And, ah! no Oreads hear my sigh,Excepting those of china made!

　　But, ah, with sudden power

　　In all my members blissful feelings reign!'Tis she who singeth yonder in her bower!

　　I hear that darling, darling voice again.The air is warm, and teems with fragrance clear,Sings she perchance for me alone to hear?

　　I haste, and trample down the shrubs amain;The trees make way, the bushes all retreat,And so--the beast is lying at her feet.

　　She looks at him: "The monster's droll enough!

　　He's, for a bear, too mild,

　　Yet, for a dog, too wild,So shaggy, clumsy, rough!"Upon his back she gently strokes her foot;

　　He thinks himself in Paradise.What feelings through his seven senses shoot!

　　But she looks on with careless eyes.I lick her soles, and kiss her shoes,

　　As gently as a bear well may;Softly I rise, and with a clever ruse

　　Leap on her knee.--On a propitious dayShe suffers it; my ears then tickles she,

　　And hits me a hard blow in wanton play;I growl with new-born ecstasy;Then speaks she in a sweet vain jest, I wot"Allons lout doux! eh! la menotte!Et faites serviteurComme un joli seigneur."Thus she proceeds with sport and glee;

　　Hope fills the oft-deluded beast;Yet if one moment he would lazy be,

　　Her fondness all at once hath ceas'd.

　　She doth a flask of balsam-fire possess,

　　Sweeter than honey bees can make,

　　One drop of which she'll on her finger take,When soften'd by his love and faithfulness,

　　Wherewith her monster's raging thirst to slake;Then leaves me to myself, and flies at last,And I, unbound, yet prison'd fastBy magic, follow in her train,Seek for her, tremble, fly again.The hapless creature thus tormenteth she,

　　Regardless of his pleasure or his woe;Ha! oft half-open'd does she leave the door for me,

　　And sideways looks to learn if I will fly or no.And I--Oh gods! your hands aloneCan end the spell that's o'er me thrown;Free me, and gratitude my heart will fill;

　　And yet from heaven ye send me down no aid--

　　Not quite in vain doth life my limbs pervade:I feel it! Strength is left me still.

　　1775.-----TO CHARLOTTE.

　　'MIDST the noise of merriment and glee,

　　'Midst full many a sorrow, many a care,Charlotte, I remember, we remember thee,

　　How, at evening's hour so fair,Thou a kindly hand didst reach us,

　　When thou, in some happy place

　　Where more fair is Nature s face,

　　Many a lightly-hidden traceOf a spirit loved didst teach us.

　　Well 'tis that thy worth I rightly knew,--

　　That I, in the hour when first we met,

　　While the first impression fill'd me yet,Call'd thee then a girl both good and true.

　　Rear'd in silence, calmly, knowing nought,

　　On the world we suddenly are thrown;Hundred thousand billows round us sport;

　　All things charm us--many please alone,Many grieve us, and as hour on hour is stealing,

　　To and fro our restless natures sway;First we feel, and then we find each feeling

　　By the changeful world-stream borne away.

　　Well I know, we oft within us find

　　Many a hope and many a smart.Charlotte, who can know our mind?

　　Charlotte, who can know our heart?Ah! 'twould fain be understood, 'twould fain o'erflow

　　In some creature's fellow-feelings blest,And, with trust, in twofold measure know

　　All the grief and joy in Nature's breast.

　　Then thine eye is oft around thee cast,

　　But in vain, for all seems closed for ever.Thus the fairest part of life is madly pass'd

　　Free from storm, but resting never:To thy sorrow thou'rt to-day repell'd

　　By what yesterday obey'd thee.Can that world by thee be worthy held

　　Which so oft betray'd thee?

　　Which, 'mid all thy pleasures and thy pains,

　　Lived in selfish, unconcern'd repose?See, the soul its secret cells regains,

　　And the heart--makes haste to close.Thus found I thee, and gladly went to meet thee;

　　"She's worthy of all love!" I cried,And pray'd that Heaven with purest bliss might greet thee,

　　Which in thy friend it richly hath supplied.

　　1776.*-----LOVE'S DISTRESSES.

　　WHO will hear me? Whom shall I lament to?Who would pity me that heard my sorrows?Ah, the lip that erst so many rapturesUsed to taste, and used to give responsive,Now is cloven, and it pains me sorely;And it is not thus severely woundedBy my mistress having caught me fiercely,And then gently bitten me, intendingTo secure her friend more firmly to her:No, my tender lip is crack'd thus, onlyBy the winds, o'er rime and frost proceeding,Pointed, sharp, unloving, having met me.Now the noble grape's bright juice commingledWith the bee's sweet juice, upon the fireOf my hearth, shall ease me of my torment.Ah, what use will all this be, if with itLove adds not a drop of his own balsam?

　　1789.*-----THE MUSAGETES.

　　IN the deepest nights of WinterTo the Muses kind oft cried I:"Not a ray of morn is gleaming,Not a sign of daylight breaking;Bring, then, at the fitting moment,Bring the lamp's soft glimm'ring lustre,'Stead of Phoebus and Aurora,To enliven my still labours!"Yet they left me in my slumbers,Dull and unrefreshing, lying,And to each late-waken'd morningFollow'd days devoid of profit.

　　When at length return'd the spring-time,To the nightingales thus spake I:"Darling nightingales, oh, beat yeEarly, early at my window,--Wake me from the heavy slumberThat chains down the youth so strongly!"Yet the love-o'erflowing songstersTheir sweet melodies protractedThrough the night before my window,Kept awake my loving spirit,Rousing new and tender yearningsIn my newly-waken'd bosom.And the night thus fleeted o'er me,And Aurora found me sleeping,--Ay, the sun could scarce arouse me.

　　Now at length is come the Summer,And the early fly so busyDraws me from my pleasing slumbersAt the first-born morning-glimmer.Mercilessly then returns she,Though the half-aroused one oftenScares her from him with impatience,And she lures her shameless sisters,So that from my weary eyelidsKindly sleep ere long is driven.From my couch then boldly spring I,And I seek the darling Muses,in the beechen-grove I find them,Full of pieasure to receive me;And to the tormenting insectsOwe I many a golden hour.Thus be ye, unwelcome beings,Highly valued by the poet,As the flies my numbers tell of.

　　1798.-----MORNING LAMENT.

　　OH thou cruel deadly-lovely maiden,Tell me what great sin have I committed,That thou keep'st me to the rack thus fasten'd,That thou hast thy solemn promise broken?

　　'Twas but yestere'en that thou with fondnessPress'd my hand, and these sweet accents murmured:"Yes, I'll come, I'll come when morn approacheth,Come, my friend, full surely to thy chamber."

　　On the latch I left my doors, unfasten'd,Having first with care tried all the hinges,And rejoic'd right well to find they creak'd not.

　　What a night of expectation pass'd I!For I watch'd, and ev'ry chime I number'd;If perchance I slept a few short moments,Still my heart remain'd awake forever,And awoke me from my gentle slumbers.

　　Yes, then bless'd I night's o'erhanging darkness,That so calmly cover'd all things round me;I enjoy'd the universal silence,While I listen'd ever in the silence,If perchance the slightest sounds were stirring.

　　"Had she only thoughts, my thoughts resembling,Had she only feelings, like my feelings,She would not await the dawn of morning.But, ere this, would surely have been with me."

　　Skipp'd a kitten on the floor above me,Scratch'd a mouse a panel in the corner,Was there in the house the slightest motion,Ever hoped I that I heard thy footstep,Ever thought I that I heard thee coming.And so lay I long, and ever longer,And already was the daylight dawning,And both here and there were signs of movement.

　　"Is it yon door? Were it my door only!"In my bed I lean'd upon my elbow,Looking tow'rd the door, now half-apparent,If perchance it might not be in motion.Both the wings upon the latch continued,On the quiet hinges calmly hanging.

　　And the day grew bright and brighter ever;And I heard my neighbour's door unbolted,As he went to earn his daily wages,And ere long I heard the waggons rumbling,And the city gates were also open'd,While the market-place, in ev'ry corner,Teem'd with life and bustle and confusion.

　　In the house was going now and comingUp and down the stairs, and doors were creakingBackwards now, now forwards,--footsteps clatter'dYet, as though it were a thing all-living,From my cherish'd hope I could not tear me.

　　When at length the sun, in hated splendour.Fell upon my walls, upon my windows,Up I sprang, and hasten'd to the garden,There to blend my breath, so hot and yearning,With the cool refreshing morning breezes,And, it might be, even there to meet thee:But I cannot find thee in the arbour,Or the avenue of lofty lindens.

　　1789.*-----THE VISIT.

　　FAIN had I to-day surprised my mistress,But soon found I that her door was fasten'd.Yet I had the key safe in my pocket,And the darling door I open'd softly!In the parlour found I not the maiden,Found the maiden not within her closet,Then her chamber-door I gently open'd,When I found her wrapp'd in pleasing slumbers,Fully dress'd, and lying on the sofa.

　　While at work had slumber stolen o'er her;For her knitting and her needle found IResting in her folded bands so tender;And I placed myself beside her softly,And held counsel, whether I should wake her.

　　Then I looked upon the beauteous quietThat on her sweet eyelids was reposingOn her lips was silent truth depicted,On her cheeks had loveliness its dwelling,And the pureness of a heart unsulliedIn her bosom evermore was heaving.All her limbs were gracefully reclining,Set at rest by sweet and godlike balsam.Gladly sat I, and the contemplationHeld the strong desire I felt to wake herFirmer and firmer down, with mystic fetters.

　　"Oh, thou love," methought, "I see that slumber,Slumber that betrayeth each false feature,Cannot injure thee, can nought discoverThat could serve to harm thy friend's soft feelings.

　　"Now thy beauteous eyes are firmly closed,That, when open, form mine only rapture.And thy sweet lips are devoid of motion,Motionless for speaking or for kissing;Loosen'd are the soft and magic fettersOf thine arms, so wont to twine around me,And the hand, the ravishing companionOf thy sweet caresses, lies unmoving.Were my thoughts of thee but based on error,Were the love I bear thee self-deception,I must now have found it out, since AmorIs, without his bandage, placed beside me."

　　Long I sat thus, full of heartfelt pleasureAt my love, and at her matchless merit;She had so delighted me while slumbering,That I could not venture to awake her.

　　Then I on the little table near herSoftly placed two oranges, two roses;Gently, gently stole I from her chamber.When her eyes the darling one shall open,She will straightway spy these colourd presents,And the friendly gift will view with wonder,For the door will still remain unopen'd.

　　If perchance I see to-night the angel,How will she rejoice,--reward me doublyFor this sacrifice of fond affection!

　　1765.-----THE MAGIC NET.

　　Do I see a contest yonder?See I miracles or pastimes?Beauteous urchins, five in number,'Gainst five sisters fair contending,--Measured is the time they're beating--At a bright enchantress' bidding.Glitt'ring spears by some are wielded,Threads are others nimbly twining,

　　So that in their snares, the weaponsOne would think, must needs be captured,Soon, in truth, the spears are prison'd;Yet they, in the gentle war-dance,One by one escape their fettersIn the row of loops so tender,That make haste to seize a free oneSoon as they release a captive.

　　So with contests, strivings, triumphs,Flying now, and now returning,Is an artful net soon woven,In its whiteness like the snow-flakes,That, from light amid the darkness,Draw their streaky lines so varied,As e'en colours scarce can draw them.

　　Who shall now receive that garmentFar beyond all others wish'd-for?Whom our much-loved mistress favourAs her own acknowledged servant?I am blest by kindly Fortune'sTokens true, in silence pray'd for!And I feel myself held captive,To her service now devoted.

　　Yet, e'en while I, thus enraptured,Thus adorn'd, am proudly wand'ring,See! yon wantons are entwining,Void of strife, with secret ardour,Other nets, each fine and finer,Threads of twilight interweaving,Moonbeams sweet, night-violets' balsam.

　　Ere the net is noticed by us,Is a happier one imprison'd,Whom we, one and all, togetherGreet with envy and with blessings.

　　1803.-----THE GOBLET.

　　ONCE I held a well-carved brimming goblet,--In my two hands tightly clasp'd I held it,Eagerly the sweet wine sipp'd I from it,Seeking there to drown all care and sorrow.

　　Amor enter'd in, and found me sitting,And he gently smiled in modest fashion,Smiled as though the foolish one he pitied.

　　"Friend, I know a far more beauteous vessel,One wherein to sink thy spirit wholly;Say, what wilt thou give me, if I grant it,And with other nectar fill it for thee?"

　　Oh, how kindly hath he kept his promise!For to me, who long had yearn'd, he grantedThee, my Lida, fill'd with soft affection.

　　When I clasp mine arms around thee fondly,When I drink in love's long-hoarded balsamFrom thy darling lips so true, so faithful,Fill'd with bliss thus speak I to my spirit"No! a vessel such as this, save AmorNever god hath fashion'd or been lord of!Such a form was ne'er produced by VulcanWith his cunning, reason-gifted hammers!On the leaf-crown'd mountains may LyaeusBid his Fauns, the oldest and the wisest,Pass the choicest clusters through the winepress,And himself watch o'er the fermentation:Such a draught no toil can e'er procure him!"

　　1781.-----TO THE GRASSHOPPER.

　　AFTER ANACREON.

　　[The strong resemblance of this fine poem to Cowley's Ode bearingthe same name, and beginning "Happy insect! what can be," will beat once seen.]

　　HAPPY art thou, darling insect,Who, upon the trees' tall branches,By a modest draught inspired,Singing, like a monarch livest!Thou possessest as thy portionAll that on the plains thou seest,All that by the hours is brought thee'Mongst the husbandmen thou livest,As a friend, uninjured by them,Thou whom mortals love to honour,Herald sweet of sweet Spring's advent!Yes, thou'rt loved by all the Muses,

　　Phoebus' self, too, needs must love thee;They their silver voices gave thee,Age can never steal upon thee.Wise and gentle friend of poets,Born a creature fleshless, bloodless,Though Earth's daughter, free from suff'ring,To the gods e'en almost equal.

　　1781.-----FROM 'THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER.'

　　[Prefixed to the second edition.]

　　EV'RY youth for love's sweet portion sighs,

　　Ev'ry maiden sighs to win man's love;Why, alas! should bitter pain arise

　　From the noblest passion that we prove?

　　Thou, kind soul, bewailest, lov'st him well,

　　From disgrace his memory's saved by thee;Lo, his spirit signs from out its cell:

　　BE A MAN, NOR SEEK TO FOLLOW ME.

　　1775.-----TRILOGY OF PASSION.

　　I. TO WERTHER.

　　[This poem, written at the age of seventy-five, was appended toan edition of 'Werther,' published at that time.]

　　ONCE more, then, much-wept shadow, thou dost dare

　　Boldly to face the day's clear light,To meet me on fresh blooming meadows fair,

　　And dost not tremble at my sight.Those happy times appear return'd once more.

　　When on one field we quaff'd refreshing dew,And, when the day's unwelcome toils were o'er,

　　The farewell sunbeams bless'd our ravish'd view;Fate bade thee go,--to linger here was mine,--Going the first, the smaller loss was thine.

　　The life of man appears a glorious fate:The day how lovely, and the night how great!And we 'mid Paradise-like raptures plac'd,The sun's bright glory scarce have learn'd to taste.

　　When strange contending feelings dimly cover,Now us, and now the forms that round us hover;One's feelings by no other are supplied,'Tis dark without, if all is bright inside;An outward brightness veils my sadden'd mood,When Fortune smiles,--how seldom understood!Now think we that we know her, and with mightA woman's beauteous form instils delight;The youth, as glad as in his infancy,The spring-time treads, as though the spring were heRavish'd, amazed, he asks, how this is done?He looks around, the world appears his own.With careless speed he wanders on through space,Nor walls, nor palaces can check his race;As some gay flight of birds round tree-tops plays,So 'tis with him who round his mistress strays;He seeks from AEther, which he'd leave behind him,The faithful look that fondly serves to bind him.

　　Yet first too early warn'd, and then too late,He feels his flight restrain'd, is captur'd straightTo meet again is sweet, to part is sad,Again to meet again is still more glad,And years in one short moment are enshrin'd;But, oh, the harsh farewell is hid behind!

　　Thou smilest, friend, with fitting thoughts inspired;By a dread parting was thy fame acquired,Thy mournful destiny we sorrow'd o'er,For weal and woe thou left'st us evermore,And then again the passions' wavering forceDrew us along in labyrinthine course;And we, consumed by constant misery,At length must part--and parting is to die!How moving is it, when the minstrel sings,To 'scape the death that separation brings!Oh grant, some god, to one who suffers so,To tell, half-guilty, his sad tale of woe

　　1824

　　II. ELEGY.

　　When man had ceased to utter his lament,

　　A god then let me tell my tale of sorrow.

　　WHAT hope of once more meeting is there nowIn the still-closed blossoms of this day?Both heaven and hell thrown open seest thou;What wav'ring thoughts within the bosom playNo longer doubt! Descending from the sky,She lifts thee in her arms to realms on high.

　　And thus thou into Paradise wert brought,

　　As worthy of a pure and endless life;Nothing was left, no wish, no hope, no thought,

　　Here was the boundary of thine inmost strife:And seeing one so fair, so glorified,The fount of yearning tears was straightway dried.

　　No motion stirr'd the day's revolving wheel,

　　In their own front the minutes seem'd to go;The evening kiss, a true and binding seal,

　　Ne'er changing till the morrow's sunlight glow.The hours resembled sisters as they went.Yet each one from another different.

　　The last hour's kiss, so sadly sweet, effac'd

　　A beauteous network of entwining love.Now on the threshold pause the feet, now haste.

　　As though a flaming cherub bade them move;The unwilling eye the dark road wanders o'er,Backward it looks, but closed it sees the door.

　　And now within itself is closed this breast,

　　As though it ne'er were open, and as though,Vying with ev'ry star, no moments blest

　　Had, in its presence, felt a kindling glow;Sadness, reproach, repentance, weight of care,Hang heavy on it in the sultry air.

　　Is not the world still left? The rocky steeps,

　　Are they with holy shades no longer crown'd?Grows not the harvest ripe? No longer creeps

　　The espalier by the stream,--the copse around?Doth not the wondrous arch of heaven still rise,Now rich in shape, now shapeless to the eyes?

　　As, seraph-like, from out the dark clouds' chorus,

　　With softness woven, graceful, light, and fair,Resembling Her, in the blue aether o'er us,

　　A slender figure hovers in the air,--Thus didst thou see her joyously advance,The fairest of the fairest in the dance.

　　Yet but a moment dost thou boldly dare

　　To clasp an airy form instead of hers;Back to thine heart! thou'lt find it better there,

　　For there in changeful guise her image stirsWhat erst was one, to many turneth fast,In thousand forms, each dearer than the last.

　　As at the door, on meeting lingerd she,

　　And step by step my faithful ardour bless'd,For the last kiss herself entreated me,

　　And on my lips the last last kiss impress'd,--Thus clearly traced, the lov'd one's form we view,With flames engraven on a heart so true,--

　　A heart that, firm as some embattled tower,

　　Itself for her, her in itself reveres,For her rejoices in its lasting power,

　　Conscious alone, when she herself appears;Feels itself freer in so sweet a thrall,And only beats to give her thanks in all.

　　The power of loving, and all yearning sighs

　　For love responsive were effaced and drown'd;While longing hope for joyous enterprise

　　Was form'd, and rapid action straightway found;If love can e'er a loving one inspire,Most lovingly it gave me now its fire;

　　And 'twas through her!--an inward sorrow lay

　　On soul and body, heavily oppress'd;To mournful phantoms was my sight a prey,

　　In the drear void of a sad tortured breast;Now on the well-known threshold Hope hath smil'd,Herself appeareth in the sunlight mild.

　　Unto the peace of God, which, as we read,

　　Blesseth us more than reason e'er bath done,Love's happy peace would I compare indeed,

　　When in the presence of the dearest one.There rests the heart, and there that sweetest thought,The thought of being hers, is check'd by nought.

　　In the pure bosom doth a yearning float,

　　Unto a holier, purer, unknown BeingIts grateful aspiration to devote,

　　The Ever-Nameless then unriddled seeing;We call it: piety!--such blest delightI feel a share in, when before her sight.

　　Before her sight, as 'neath the sun's hot ray,

　　Before her breath, as 'neath the spring's soft wind,In its deep wintry cavern melts away

　　Self-love, so long in icy chains confin'd;No selfishness and no self-will are nigh,For at her advent they were forced to fly.

　　It seems as though she said: "As hours pass by

　　They spread before us life with kindly plan;Small knowledge did the yesterday supply,

　　To know the morrow is conceal'd from man;And if the thought of evening made me start,The sun at setting gladden'd straight my heart.

　　"Act, then, as I, and look, with joyous mind,

　　The moment in the face; nor linger thou!Meet it with speed, so fraught with life, so kind

　　In action, and in love so radiant now;Let all things be where thou art, childlike ever,Thus thoult be all, thus, thou'lt be vanquish'd never."

　　Thou speakest well, methought, for as thy guide

　　The moment's favour did a god assign,And each one feels himself when by thy side,

　　Fate's fav'rite in a moment so divine;I tremble at thy look that bids me go,Why should I care such wisdom vast to know?

　　Now am I far! And what would best befit

　　The present minute? I could scarcely tell;Full many a rich possession offers it,

　　These but offend, and I would fain repel.Yearnings unquenchable still drive me on,All counsel, save unbounded tears, is gone.

　　Flow on, flow on in never-ceasing course,

　　Yet may ye never quench my inward fire!Within my bosom heaves a mighty force,

　　Where death and life contend in combat dire.Medicines may serve the body's pangs to still;Nought but the spirit fails in strength of will,--

　　Fails in conception; wherefore fails it so?

　　A thousand times her image it portrays;Enchanting now, and now compell'd to go,

　　Now indistinct, now clothed in purest rays!How could the smallest comfort here be flowing?The ebb and flood, the coming and the going!

　　*      *      *      *      *      *

　　Leave me here now, my life's companions true!

　　Leave me alone on rock, in moor and heath;But courage! open lies the world to you,

　　The glorious heavens above, the earth beneath;Observe, investigate, with searching eyes,And nature will disclose her mysteries.

　　To me is all, I to myself am lost,

　　Who the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought;They, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost,

　　So rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught;They urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd,Deserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground.

　　1823.

　　III.  ATONEMENT.

　　[Composed, when 74 years old, for a Polish lady, who excelled inplaying on the pianoforte.]

　　PASSION brings reason--who can pacify

　　An anguish'd heart whose loss hath been so great?Where are the hours that fled so swiftly by?

　　In vain the fairest thou didst gain from fate;Sad is the soul, confused the enterprise;

　　The glorious world, how on the sense it dies!

　　In million tones entwined for evermore,

　　Music with angel-pinions hovers there,To pierce man's being to its inmost core,

　　Eternal beauty has its fruit to bear;The eye grows moist, in yearnings blest reveresThe godlike worth of music as of tears.

　　And so the lighten'd heart soon learns to see

　　That it still lives, and beats, and ought to beat,Off'ring itself with joy and willingly,

　　In grateful payment for a gift so sweet.And then was felt,--oh may it constant prove!--The twofold bliss of music and of love.

　　1823.-----

　　THE remembrance of the GoodKeep us ever glad in mood.

　　The remembrance of the FairMakes a mortal rapture share.

　　The remembrance of one's LoveBlest Is, if it constant prove.

　　The remembrance of the OneIs the greatest joy that's known.

　　1828.-----[Written at the age of 77.]

　　WHEN I was still a youthful wight,

　　So full of enjoyment and merry,The painters used to assert, in spite,

　　That my features were small--yes, very;Yet then full many a beauteous childWith true affection upon me smil'd.

　　Now as a greybeard I sit here in state,

　　By street and by lane held in awe, sirs;And may be seen, like old Frederick the Great,

　　On pipebowls, on cups, and on saucers.Yet the beauteous maidens, they keep afar;Oh vision of youth! Oh golden star!

　　1826.-----FOR EVER.

　　THE happiness that man, whilst prison'd here,

　　Is wont with heavenly rapture to compare,--The harmony of Truth, from wavering clear,--

　　Of Friendship that is free from doubting care,--The light which in stray thoughts alone can cheer

　　The wise,--the bard alone in visions fair,--In my best hours I found in her all this,And made mine own, to mine exceeding bliss.

　　1820.*-----FROM AN ALBUM OF 1604.

　　HOPE provides wings to thought, and love to hope.Rise up to Cynthia, love, when night is clearest,And say, that as on high her figure changeth,So, upon earth, my joy decays and grows.And whisper in her ear with modest softness,How doubt oft hung its head, and truth oft wept.And oh ye thoughts, distrustfully inclined,If ye are therefore by the loved one chided,Answer: 'tis true ye change, but alter not,As she remains the same, yet changeth ever.Doubt may invade the heart, but poisons not,For love is sweeter, by suspicion flavour'd.If it with anger overcasts the eye,And heaven's bright purity perversely blackens,Then zephyr-sighs straight scare the clouds away,And, changed to tears, dissolve them into rain.Thought, hope, and love remain there as before,Till Cynthia gleams upon me as of old.

　　1820.*-----LINES ON SEEING SCHILLER'S SKULL.

　　[This curious imitation of the ternary metre of Dante was writtenat the age of 77.]

　　WITHIN a gloomy charnel-house one day

　　I view'd the countless skulls, so strangely mated,And of old times I thought, that now were grey.

　　Close pack'd they stand, that once so fiercely hated,And hardy bones, that to the death contended,

　　Are lying cross'd,--to lie for ever, fated.What held those crooked shoulder-blades suspended?

　　No one now asks; and limbs with vigour fired,The hand, the foot--their use in life is ended.

　　Vainly ye sought the tomb for rest when tired;Peace in the grave may not be yours; ye're driven

　　Back into daylight by a force inspired;But none can love the wither'd husk, though even

　　A glorious noble kernel it contained.To me, an adept, was the writing given

　　Which not to all its holy sense explained,When 'mid the crowd, their icy shadows flinging,

　　I saw a form, that glorious still remained.And even there, where mould and damp were clinging,

　　Gave me a blest, a rapture-fraught emotion,As though from death a living fount were springing.

　　What mystic joy I felt! What rapt devotion!That form, how pregnant with a godlike trace!

　　A look, how did it whirl me tow'rd that oceanWhose rolling billows mightier shapes embrace!

　　Mysterious vessel! Oracle how dear!Even to grasp thee is my hand too base,

　　Except to steal thee from thy prison hereWith pious purpose, and devoutly go

　　Back to the air, free thoughts, and sunlight clear.What greater gain in life can man e'er know

　　Than when God-Nature will to him explainHow into Spirit steadfastness may flow,

　　How steadfast, too, the Spirit-Born remain.

　　1826.-----ROYAL PRAYER.

　　HA, I am the lord of earth! The noble,

　　Who're in my service, love me.Ha, I am the lord of earth! The noble,

　　O'er whom my sway extendeth, love I.Oh, grant me, God in Heaven, that I may ne'er

　　Dispense with loftiness and love!

　　1815.*-----HUMAN FEELINGS.

　　AH, ye gods! ye great immortalsIn the spacious heavens above us!Would ye on this earth but give usSteadfast minds and dauntless courageWe, oh kindly ones, would leave youAll your spacious heavens above us!

　　1815.*-----ON THE DIVAN.

　　HE who knows himself and others

　　Here will also see,That the East and West, like brothers,

　　Parted ne'er shall be.

　　Thoughtfully to float for ever

　　'Tween two worlds, be man's endeavour!So between the East and West

　　To revolve, be my behest!

　　1833.*-----EXPLANATION  OF AN ANCIENT WOODCUT, REPRESENTINGHANS SACHS' POETICAL MISSION.

　　[I feel considerable hesitation in venturing to offer thisversion of a poem which Carlyle describes to be 'a beautifulpiece (a very Hans Sacks beatified, both in character and style),which we wish there was any possibility of translating.' Thereader will be aware that Hans Sachs was the celebrated Minstrel-Cobbler of Nuremberg, who Wrote 208 plays, 1700 comic tales, andbetween 4000 and 5000 lyric poems. He flourished throughoutalmost the whole of the 16th century.]

　　EARLY within his workshop here,On Sundays stands our master dear;His dirty apron he puts away,And wears a cleanly doublet to-day;Lets wax'd thread, hammer, and pincers rest,And lays his awl within his chest;The seventh day he takes reposeFrom many pulls and many blows.

　　Soon as the spring-sun meets his view,Repose begets him labour anew;He feels that he holds within his brainA little world, that broods there amain,And that begins to act and to live,Which he to others would gladly give.

　　He had a skilful eye and true,And was full kind and loving too.For contemplation, clear and pure,--For making all his own again, sure;He had a tongue that charm'd when 'twas heard,And graceful and light flow'd ev'ry word;Which made the Muses in him rejoice,The Master-singer of their choice.

　　And now a maiden enter'd there,With swelling breast, and body fair;With footing firm she took her place,And moved with stately, noble grace;She did not walk in wanton mood,Nor look around with glances lewd.

　　She held a measure in her hand,Her girdle was a golden band,A wreath of corn was on her head,Her eye the day's bright lustre shed;Her name is honest Industry,Else, Justice, Magnanimity.

　　She enter'd with a kindly greeting;He felt no wonder at the meeting,For, kind and fair as she might be,He long had known her, fancied he.

　　"I have selected thee," she said,"From all who earth's wild mazes tread,That thou shouldst have clear-sighted sense,And nought that's wrong shouldst e'er commence.When others run in strange confusion,Thy gaze shall see through each illusionWhen others dolefully complain,Thy cause with jesting thou shalt gain,Honour and right shalt value duly,In everything act simply, truly,--Virtue and godliness proclaim,And call all evil by its name,Nought soften down, attempt no quibble,Nought polish up, nought vainly scribble.The world shall stand before thee, then,As seen by Albert Durer's ken,In manliness and changeless life,In inward strength, with firmness rife.Fair Nature's Genius by the handShall lead thee on through every land,Teach thee each different life to scan,Show thee the wondrous ways of man,His shifts, confusions, thrustings, and drubbings,Pushings, tearings, pressings, and rubbings;The varying madness of the crew,The anthill's ravings bring to view;But thou shalt see all this express'd,As though 'twere in a magic chest.Write these things down for folks on earth,In hopes they may to wit give birth."--Then she a window open'd wide,And show'd a motley crowd outside,All kinds of beings 'neath the sky,As in his writings one may spy.

　　Our master dear was, after this,On Nature thinking, full of bliss,When tow'rd him, from the other sideHe saw an aged woman glide;The name she bears, Historia,Mythologia, Fabula;With footstep tottering and unstableShe dragg'd a large and wooden carved-table,Where, with wide sleeves and human mien,The Lord was catechizing seen;Adam, Eve, Eden, the Serpent's seduction,Gomorrah and Sodom's awful destruction,The twelve illustrious women, too,That mirror of honour brought to view;All kinds of bloodthirstiness, murder, and sin,The twelve wicked tyrants also were in,And all kinds of goodly doctrine and law;Saint Peter with his scourge you saw,With the world's ways dissatisfied,And by our Lord with power supplied.Her train and dress, behind and before,And e'en the seams, were painted o'erWith tales of worldly virtue and crime.--Our master view'd all this for a time;The sight right gladly he survey'd,So useful for him in his trade,Whence he was able to procureExample good and precept sure,Recounting all with truthful care,As though he had been present there.His spirit seem'd from earth to fly,He ne'er had turned away his eye,Did he not just behind him hearA rattle of bells approaching near.And now a fool doth catch his eye,With goat and ape's leap drawing nighA merry interlude preparingWith fooleries and jests unsparing.Behind him, in a line drawn out,He dragg'd all fools, the lean and stout,The great and little, the empty and full,All too witty, and all too dull,A lash he flourish'd overhead,As though a dance of apes he led,Abusing them with bitterness,As though his wrath would ne'er grow less.

　　While on this sight our master gazed,His head was growing well-nigh crazed:What words for all could he e'er find,Could such a medley be combined?Could he continue with delightFor evermore to sing and write?When lo, from out a cloud's dark bedIn at the upper window spedThe Muse, in all her majesty,As fair as our loved maids we see.With clearness she around him threwHer truth, that ever stronger grew.

　　"I, to ordain thee come," she spake:"So prosper, and my blessing take!The holy fire that slumb'ring liesWithin thee, in bright flames shall rise;Yet that thine ever-restless lifeMay still with kindly strength be rife,I, for thine inward spirit's calm.Have granted nourishment and balm,That rapture may thy soul imbue,Like some fair blossom bathed in dew."--Behind his house then secretlyOutside the doorway pointed she,Where, in a shady garden-nook,A beauteous maid with downcast lookWas sitting where a stream was flowing,With elder bushes near it growing,She sat beneath an apple tree,And nought around her seem'd to see.Her lap was full of roses fair,Which in a wreath she twined with care.And, with them, leaves and blossoms blended:For whom was that sweet wreath intended?Thus sat she, modest and retired,Her bosom throbb'd, with hope inspired;Such deep forebodings fill'd her mind,No room for wishing could she find,And with the thoughts that o'er it flew,Perchance a sigh was mingled too.

　　"But why should sorrow cloud thy brow?That, dearest love, which fills thee nowIs fraught with joy and ecstasy.Prepared in one alone for thee,That he within thine eye may findSolace when fortune proves unkind,And be newborn through many a kiss,That he receives with inward bliss;When'er he clasps thee to his breast.May he from all his toils find restWhen he in thy dear arms shall sink,May he new life and vigour drink:Fresh joys of youth shalt thou obtain,In merry jest rejoice again.With raillery and roguish spite,Thou now shalt tease him, now delight.Thus Love will nevermore grow old,Thus will the minstrel ne'er be cold!"

　　While he thus lives, in secret bless'd,Above him in the clouds doth restAn oak-wreath, verdant and sublime,Placed on his brow in after-time;While they are banish'd to the slough,Who their great master disavow.

　　SONNETS.

　　-----Lovingly I'll sing of love;Ever comes she from above.-----THE FRIENDLY MEETING.

　　IN spreading mantle to my chin conceald,

　　I trod the rocky path, so steep and grey,

　　Then to the wintry plain I bent my wayUneasily, to flight my bosom steel'd.

　　But sudden was the newborn day reveal'd:

　　A maiden came, in heavenly bright array,

　　Like the fair creatures of the poet's layIn realms of song. My yearning heart was heal'd.

　　Yet turn'd I thence, till she had onward pass'd,

　　While closer still the folds to draw I tried,

　　As though with heat self-kindled to grow warm;

　　But follow'd her. She stood. The die was cast!

　　No more within my mantle could I hide;

　　I threw it off,--she lay within mine arm.

　　1807-8.-----IN A WORD.

　　THUS to be chain'd for ever, can I bear?

　　A very torment that, in truth, would be.

　　This very day my new resolve shall see.--I'll not go near the lately-worshipp'd Fair.

　　Yet what excuse, my heart, can I prepare

　　In such a case, for not consulting thee?

　　But courage! while our sorrows utter weIn tones where love, grief, gladness have a share.

　　But see! the minstrel's bidding to obey,

　　Its melody pours forth the sounding lyre,

　　Yearning a sacrifice of love to bring.

　　Scarce wouldst thou think it--ready is the lay;

　　Well, but what then? Methought in the first fire

　　We to her presence flew, that lay to sing.

　　1807?.-----THE MAIDEN SPEAKS.

　　How grave thou loookest, loved one! wherefore so?

　　Thy marble image seems a type of thee;

　　Like it, no sign of life thou giv'st to me;Compared with thee, the stone appears to glow.

　　Behind his shield in ambush lurks the foe,

　　The friend's brow all-unruffled we should see.

　　I seek thee, but thou seek'st away to flee;Fix'd as this sculptured figure, learn to grow!

　　Tell me, to which should I the preference pay?

　　Must I from both with coldness meet alone?

　　The one is lifeless, thou with life art blest.

　　In short, no longer to throw words away,

　　I'll fondy kiss and kiss and kiss this stone,

　　Till thou dost tear me hence with envious breast.

　　1807.-----GROWTH.

　　O'ER field and plain, in childhood's artless days,

　　Thou sprang'st with me, on many a spring-morn fair.

　　"For such a daughter, with what pleasing care,Would I, as father, happy dwellings raise!"

　　And when thou on the world didst cast thy gaze,

　　Thy joy was then in household toils to share.

　　"Why did I trust her, why she trust me e'er?For such a sister, how I Heaven should praise!"

　　Nothing can now the beauteous growth retard;

　　Love's glowing flame within my breast is fann'd.

　　Shall I embrace her form, my grief to end?

　　Thee as a queen must I, alas, regard:

　　So high above me placed thou seem'st to stand;

　　Before a passing look I meekly bend.

　　1807?.-----FOOD IN TRAVEL.

　　IF to her eyes' bright lustre I were blind,

　　No longer would they serve my life to gild.

　　The will of destiny must be fulfilid,--This knowing, I withdrew with sadden'd mind.

　　No further happiness I now could find:

　　The former longings of my heart were still'd;

　　I sought her looks alone, whereon to buildMy joy in life,--all else was left behind.

　　Wine's genial glow, the festal banquet gay,

　　Ease, sleep, and friends, all wonted pleasures glad

　　I spurn'd, till little there remain'd to prove.

　　Now calmly through the world I wend my way:

　　That which I crave may everywhere be had,

　　With me I bring the one thing needful--love.

　　1807?.-----DEPARTURE.

　　WITH many a thousand kiss not yet content,

　　At length with One kiss I was forced to go;

　　After that bitter parting's depth of woe,I deem'd the shore from which my steps I bent,

　　Its hills, streams, dwellings, mountains, as I went,

　　A pledge of joy, till daylight ceased to glow;

　　Then on my sight did blissful visions growIn the dim-lighted, distant firmament,

　　And when at length the sea confined my gaze,

　　My ardent longing fill'd my heart once more;

　　What I had lost, unwillingly I sought.

　　Then Heaven appear'd to shed its kindly rays:

　　Methought that all I had possess'd of yore

　　Remain'd still mine--that I was reft of nought.

　　1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE WRITES.

　　THE look that thy sweet eyes on mine impress

　　The pledge thy lips to mine convey,--the kiss,--

　　He who, like me, hath knowledge sure of this,Can he in aught beside find happiness?

　　Removed from thee, friend-sever'd, in distress,

　　These thoughts I vainly struggle to dismiss:

　　They still return to that one hour of bliss,The only one; then tears my grief confess.

　　But unawares the tear makes haste to dry:

　　He loves, methinks, e'en to these glades so still,--

　　And shalt not thou to distant lands extend?

　　Receive the murmurs of his loving sigh;

　　My only joy on earth is in thy will,

　　Thy kindly will tow'rd me; a token send!

　　1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE ONCE MORE.

　　WHY do I o'er my paper once more bend?

　　Ask not too closely, dearest one, I pray

　　For, to speak truth, I've nothing now to say;Yet to thy hands at length 'twill come, dear friend.

　　Since I can come not with it, what I send

　　My undivided heart shall now convey,

　　With all its joys, hopes, pleasures, pains, to-day:All this hath no beginning, hath no end.

　　Henceforward I may ne'er to thee confide

　　How, far as thought, wish, fancy, will, can reach,

　　My faithful heart with thine is surely blended.

　　Thus stood I once enraptured by thy side,

　　Gazed on thee, and said nought. What need of speech?

　　My very being in itself was ended.

　　1807?.-----SHE CANNOT END.

　　WHEN unto thee I sent the page all white,

　　Instead of first thereon inscribing aught,

　　The space thou doubtless filledst up in sport.And sent it me, to make my joy grow bright.

　　As soon as the blue cover met my sight,

　　As well becomes a woman, quick as thought

　　I tore it open, leaving hidden nought,And read the well-known words of pure delight:

　　MY ONLY BEING! DEAREST HEART! SWEET CHILD!

　　How kindly thou my yearning then didst still

　　With gentle words, enthralling me to thee.

　　In truth methought I read thy whispers mild

　　Wherewith thou lovingly my soul didst fill,

　　E'en to myself for aye ennobling me.

　　1807?.-----NEMESIS.

　　WHEN through the nations stalks contagion wild,

　　We from them cautiously should steal away.

　　E'en I have oft with ling'ring and delayShunn'd many an influence, not to be defil'd.

　　And e'en though Amor oft my hours beguil'd,

　　At length with him preferr'd I not to play,

　　And so, too, with the wretched sons of clay,When four and three-lined verses they compil'd.

　　But punishment pursues the scoffer straight,

　　As if by serpent-torch of furies led

　　From bill to vale, from land to sea to fly.

　　I hear the genie's laughter at my fate;

　　Yet do I find all power of thinking fled

　　In sonnet-rage and love's fierce ecstasy.

　　1807-8.-----THE CHRISTMAS-BOX.

　　THIS box, mine own sweet darling, thou wilt find

　　With many a varied sweetmeat's form supplied;

　　The fruits are they of holy Christmas tide,But baked indeed, for children's use design'd.

　　I'd fain, in speeches sweet with skill combin'd,

　　Poetic sweetmeats for the feast provide;

　　But why in such frivolities confide?Perish the thought, with flattery to blind!

　　One sweet thing there is still, that from within,

　　Within us speaks,--that may be felt afar;

　　This may be wafted o'er to thee alone.

　　If thou a recollection fond canst win,

　　As if with pleasure gleam'd each well-known star,

　　The smallest gift thou never wilt disown.

　　1807.-----THE WARNING.

　　WHEN sounds the trumpet at the Judgment Day,

　　And when forever all things earthly die,

　　We must a full and true account supplyOf ev'ry useless word we dropp'd in play.

　　But what effect will all the words convey

　　Wherein with eager zeal and lovingly,

　　That I might win thy favour, labour'd I,If on thine ear alone they die away?

　　Therefore, sweet love, thy conscience bear in mind,

　　Remember well how long thou hast delay'd,

　　So that the world such sufferings may not know.

　　If I must reckon, and excuses find

　　For all things useless I to thee have said,

　　To a full year the Judgment Day will grow

　　1807?.-----THE EPOCHS.

　　ON Petrarch's heart, all other days before,

　　In flaming letters written, was impress d

　　GOOD FRIDAY. And on mine, be it confess'd,Is this year's ADVENT, as it passeth o'er.

　　I do not now begin,--I still adore

　　Her whom I early cherish'd in my breast;,

　　Then once again with prudence dispossess'd,And to whose heart I'm driven back once more.

　　The love of Petrarch, that all-glorious love,

　　Was unrequited, and, alas, full sad;

　　One long Good Friday 'twas, one heartache drear

　　But may my mistress' Advent ever prove,

　　With its palm-jubilee, so sweet and glad,

　　One endless Mayday, through the livelong year!

　　1807.-----THE DOUBTERS AND THE LOVERS.

　　THE DOUBTERS.

　　YE love, and sonnets write! Fate's strange behest!

　　The heart, its hidden meaning to declare,

　　Must seek for rhymes, uniting pair with pair:Learn, children, that the will is weak, at best.

　　Scarcely with freedom the o'erflowing breast

　　As yet can speak, and well may it beware;

　　Tempestuous passions sweep each chord that's there,Then once more sink to night and gentle rest.

　　Why vex yourselves and us, the heavy stone

　　Up the steep path but step by step to roll?

　　It falls again, and ye ne'er cease to strive.

　　THE LOVERS.

　　But we are on the proper road alone!

　　If gladly is to thaw the frozen soul,

　　The fire of love must aye be kept alive.

　　1807?.-----CHARADE.

　　Two words there 'are, both short, of beauty rare,

　　Whose sounds our lips so often love to frame,

　　But which with clearness never can proclaimThe things whose own peculiar stamp they bear.

　　'Tis well in days of age and youth so fair,

　　One on the other boldly to inflame;

　　And if those words together link'd we name,A blissful rapture we discover there.

　　But now to give them pleasure do I seek,

　　And in myself my happiness would find;

　　I hope in silence, but I hope for this:

　　Gently, as loved one's names, those words to speak

　　To see them both within one image shrin'd,

　　Both in one being to embrace with bliss.

　　1807.-----

　　EPIGRAMS.

　　-----In these numbers be express'dMeaning deep, 'neath merry jest.-----

　　TO ORIGINALS.

　　A FELLOW says: "I own no school or college;No master lives whom I acknowledge;And pray don't entertain the thoughtThat from the dead I e'er learnt aught."This, if I rightly understand,Means: "I'm a blockhead at first hand."

　　1815.-----THE SOLDIER'S CONSOLATION.

　　No! in truth there's here no lack:White the bread, the maidens black!To another town, next night:Black the bread, the maidens white!

　　1815.*-----GENIAL IMPULSE.

　　THUS roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes,Now serious am, now seek to please;Now love and hate in turn one sees;The motives now are those, now these;Now nothings, now realities.Thus roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes.

　　1810.-----NEITHER THIS NOR THAT.

　　IF thou to be a slave shouldst will,Thou'lt get no pity, but fare ill;And if a master thou wouldst be,The world will view it angrily;And if in statu quo thou stay,That thou art but a fool, they'll say.

　　1815.*-----THE WAY TO BEHAVE.

　　THOUGH tempers are bad and peevish folks swear,Remember to ruffle thy brows, friend, ne'er;And let not the fancies of women so fairE'er serve thy pleasure in life to impair.

　　1815.*-----THE BEST.

　　WHEN head and heart are busy, say,

　　What better can be found?Who neither loves nor goes astray,

　　Were better under ground.

　　1815.*-----AS BROAD AS IT'S LONG.

　　MODEST men must needs endure,

　　And the bold must humbly bow;Thus thy fate's the same, be sure,

　　Whether bold or modest thou.

　　1815.*-----THE RULE OF LIFE.

　　IF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;As little as possible be thou annoy'd,And let the present be ever enjoy'd;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.

　　1815.*-----THE SAME, EXPANDED.

　　IF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;If any loss thou hast to rue,Act as though thou wert born anew;Inquire the meaning of each day,What each day means itself will say;In thine own actions take thy pleasure,What others do, thou'lt duly treasure;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.

　　-----

　　IF wealth is gone--then something is gone!

　　Quick, make up thy mind,

　　And fresh wealth find.If honour is gone--then much is gone!

　　Seek glory to find,

　　And people then will alter their mind.If courage is gone--then all is gone!'Twere better that thou hadst never been born.

　　-----

　　HE who with life makes sport,

　　Can prosper never;Who rules himself in nought,

　　Is a slave ever.

　　MAY each honest effort be

　　Crown'd with lasting constancy.

　　-----

　　EACH road to the proper endRuns straight on, without a bend.

　　1825.-----CALM AT SEA.

　　SILENCE deep rules o'er the waters,

　　Calmly slumb'ring lies the main,While the sailor views with trouble

　　Nought but one vast level plain.

　　Not a zephyr is in motion!

　　Silence fearful as the grave!In the mighty waste of ocean

　　Sunk to rest is ev'ry wave.

　　1795.-----THE PROSPEROUS VOYAGE.

　　THE mist is fast clearing.And radiant is heaven,Whilst AEolus loosensOur anguish-fraught bond.The zephyrs are sighing,Alert is the sailor.Quick! nimbly be plying!The billows are riven,The distance approaches;I see land beyond!

　　1795.-----COURAGE.

　　CARELESSLY over the plain away,Where by the boldest man no pathCut before thee thou canst discern,Make for thyself a path!

　　Silence, loved one, my heart!Cracking, let it not break!Breaking, break not with thee!

　　1776.*-----MY ONLY PROPERTY.

　　I FEEL that I'm possess'd of nought,Saving the free unfetterd thought

　　Which from my bosom seeks to flow,And each propitious passing hourThat suffers me in all its power

　　A loving fate with truth to know.

　　1814.-----ADMONITION.

　　WHEREFORE ever ramble on?

　　For the Good is lying near,Fortune learn to seize alone,

　　For that Fortune's ever here.

　　1789.-----OLD AGE.

　　OLD age is courteous--no one more:For time after time he knocks at the door,But nobody says, "Walk in, sir, pray!"Yet turns he not from the door away,But lifts the latch, and enters with speed.And then they cry "A cool one, indeed!"

　　1814.-----EPITAPH.

　　As a boy, reserved and naughty;As a youth, a coxcomb and haughty;As a man, for action inclined;As a greybeard, fickle in mind.--Upon thy grave will people read:This was a very man, indeed!

　　1815.*-----RULES FOR MONARCHS.

　　IF men are never their thoughts to employ,Take care to provide them a life full of joy;But if to some profit and use thou wouldst bend them,Take care to shear them, and then defend them.

　　1815.*-----PAULO POST FUTURI.

　　WEEP ye not, ye children dear,

　　That as yet ye are unborn:For each sorrow and each tear

　　Makes the father's heart to mourn.

　　Patient be a short time to it,

　　Unproduced, and known to none;If your father cannot do it,

　　By your mother 'twill be done.

　　1784.-----THE FOOL'S EPILOGUE.

　　MANY good works I've done and ended,Ye take the praise--I'm not offended;For in the world, I've always thoughtEach thing its true position hath sought.When praised for foolish deeds am I,I set off laughing heartily;When blamed for doing something good,I take it in an easy mood.If some one stronger gives me hard blows,That it's a jest, I feign to suppose:But if 'tis one that's but my own like,I know the way such folks to strike.When Fortune smiles, I merry grow,And sing in dulci jubilo;When sinks her wheel, and tumbles me o'er,I think 'tis sure to rise once more.

　　In the sunshine of summer I ne'er lament,Because the winter it cannot prevent;And when the white snow-flakes fall around,I don my skates, and am off with a bound.Though I dissemble as I will,The sun for me will ne'er stand still;The old and wonted course is run,Until the whole of life is done;Each day the servant like the lord,In turns comes home, and goes abroad;If proud or humble the line they take,They all must eat, drink, sleep, and wake.So nothing ever vexes me;Act like the fool, and wise ye'll be!

　　1804.-----

　　PARABLES.

　　-----Joy from that in type we borrow,Which in life gives only sorrow.-----JOY.

　　A DRAGON-FLY with beauteous wingIs hov'ring o'er a silv'ry spring;I watch its motions with delight,--Now dark its colours seem, now bright;Chameleon-like appear, now blue,Now red, and now of greenish hue.Would it would come still nearer me,That I its tints might better see

　　It hovers, flutters, resting ne'er!

　　But hush! it settles on the mead.I have it safe now, I declare!

　　And when its form I closely view,

　　'Tis of a sad and dingy blue--Such, Joy-Dissector, is thy case indeed

　　1767-9.-----EXPLANATION OF AN ANTIQUE GEM,

　　A YOUNG fig-tree its form lifts high

　　Within a beauteous garden;And see, a goat is sitting by.

　　As if he were its warden.

　　But oh, Quirites, how one errs!

　　The tree is guarded badly;For round the other side there whirrs

　　And hums a beetle madly.

　　The hero with his well-mail'd coat

　　Nibbles the branches tall so;A mighty longing feels the goat

　　Gently to climb up also.

　　And so, my friends, ere long ye see

　　The tree all leafless standing;It looks a type of misery,

　　Help of the gods demanding.

　　Then listen, ye ingenuous youth,

　　Who hold wise saws respected:From he-goat and from beetles-tooth

　　A tree should be protected!

　　1815.-----CAT-PIE.

　　WHILE he is mark'd by vision clear

　　Who fathoms Nature's treasures,The man may follow, void of fear,

　　Who her proportions measures.

　　Though for one mortal, it is true,

　　These trades may both be fitted,Yet, that the things themselves are two

　　Must always be admitted.

　　Once on a time there lived a cook

　　Whose skill was past disputing,Who in his head a fancy took

　　To try his luck at shooting.

　　So, gun in hand, he sought a spot

　　Where stores of game were breeding,And there ere long a cat he shot

　　That on young birds was feeding.

　　This cat he fancied was a hare,

　　Forming a judgment hasty,So served it up for people's fare,

　　Well-spiced and in a pasty.

　　Yet many a guest with wrath was fill'd

　　(All who had noses tender):The cat that's by the sportsman kill'd

　　No cook a hare can render.

　　1810.-----LEGEND.

　　THERE lived in the desert a holy man

　　To whom a goat-footed Faun one dayPaid a visit, and thus began

　　To his surprise: "I entreat thee to prayThat grace to me and my friends may be given,That we may be able to mount to Heaven,For great is our thirst for heav'nly bliss."The holy man made answer to this:"Much danger is lurking in thy petition,Nor will it be easy to gain admission;Thou dost not come with an angel's salute;For I see thou wearest a cloven foot."The wild man paused, and then answer'd he:"What doth my goat's foot matter to thee?Full many I've known into heaven to passStraight and with ease, with the head of an ass!"

　　1815.*-----AUTHORS.

　　OVER the meadows, and down the stream,

　　And through the garden-walks straying,He plucks the flowers that fairest seem;

　　His throbbing heart brooks no delaying.His maiden then comes--oh, what ecstasy!Thy flowers thou giv'st for one glance of her eye!

　　The gard'ner next door o'er the hedge sees the youth:"I'm not such a fool as that, in good truth;My pleasure is ever to cherish each flower,And see that no birds my fruit e'er devour.But when 'tis ripe, your money, good neighbour!'Twas not for nothing I took all this labour!"And such, methinks, are the author-tribe.

　　The one his pleasures around him strews,

　　That his friends, the public, may reap, if they choose;The other would fain make them all subscribe,

　　1776.*-----THE CRITIC.

　　I HAD a fellow as my guest,Not knowing he was such a pest,And gave him just my usual fare;He ate his fill of what was there,

　　And for desert my best things swallow'd,Soon as his meal was o'er, what follow'd?Led by the Deuce, to a neighbour he went,And talk'd of my food to his heart's content:"The soup might surely have had more spice,The meat was ill-brown'd, and the wine wasn't nice."A thousand curses alight on his head!'Tis a critic, I vow! Let the dog be struck dead!

　　1776.*-----THE DILETTANTE AND THE CRITIC.

　　A BOY a pigeon once possess'd,In gay and brilliant plumage dress'd;He loved it well, and in boyish sportIts food to take from his mouth he taught,And in his pigeon he took such pride,That his joy to others he needs must confide.

　　An aged fox near the place chanc'd to dwell,Talkative, clever, and learned as well;The boy his society used to prize,Hearing with pleasure his wonders and lies.

　　"My friend the fox my pigeon must seeHe ran, and stretch'd 'mongst the bushes lay he"Look, fox, at my pigeon, my pigeon so fair!His equal I'm sure thou hast look'd upon ne'er!"

　　"Let's see!"--The boy gave it.--"'Tis really not bad;And yet, it is far from complete, I must add.The feathers, for, instance, how short! 'Tis absurd!"So he set to work straightway to pluck the poor bird.

　　The boy screamed.--"Thou must now stronger pinions supply,Or else 'twill be ugly, unable to fly."--Soon 'twas stripp'd--oh, the villain!--and torn all to pieces.The boy was heart-broken,--and so my tale ceases.

　　*         *         *         *

　　He who sees in the boy shadow'd forth his own case,Should be on his guard 'gainst the fox's whole race.

　　1776.*-----THE WRANGLER.

　　ONE day a shameless and impudent wightWent into a shop full of steel wares bright,Arranged with art upon ev'ry shelf.He fancied they were all meant for himself;And so, while the patient owner stood by,The shining goods needs must handle and try,And valued,--for how should a fool better know?--The bad things high, and the good ones low,And all with an easy self-satisfied face;Then, having bought nothing, he left the place.

　　The tradesman now felt sorely vex'd,So when the fellow went there next,A lock of steel made quite red hot.The other cried upon the spot:"Such wares as these, who'd ever buy?the steel is tarnish'd shamefully,"--Then pull'd it, like a fool about,But soon set up a piteous shout."Pray what's the matter?" the shopman spoke;The other scream'd: "Faith, a very cool joke!"

　　1815.*-----THE YELPERS.

　　OUR rides in all directions bend,

　　For business or for pleasure,Yet yelpings on our steps attend,

　　And barkings without measure.The dog that in our stable dwells,

　　After our heels is striding,And all the while his noisy yells

　　But show that we are riding.

　　1815.*-----THE STORK'S VOCATION.

　　THE stork who worms and frogs devours

　　That in our ponds reside,Why should he dwell on high church-towers,

　　With which he's not allied?

　　Incessantly he chatters there,

　　And gives our ears no rest;But neither old nor young can dare

　　To drive him from his nest.

　　I humbly ask it,--how can he

　　Give of his title proof,Save by his happy tendency

　　To soil the church's roof?-----CELEBRITY.

　　[A satire on his own Sorrows of Werther.]

　　ON bridges small and bridges greatStands Nepomucks in ev'ry state,Of bronze, wood, painted, or of stone,Some small as dolls, some giants grown;Each passer must worship before Nepomuck,Who to die on a bridge chanced to have the ill luck,When once a man with head and earsA saint in people's eyes appears,Or has been sentenced piteouslyBeneath the hangman's hand to die,He's as a noted person prized,In portrait is immortalized.Engravings, woodcuts, are supplied,And through the world spread far and wide.Upon them all is seen his name,And ev'ry one admits his claim;Even the image of the LordIs not with greater zeal ador'd.Strange fancy of the human race!Half sinner frail, half child of graceWe see HERR WERTHER of the storyIn all the pomp of woodcut glory.His worth is first made duly known,By having his sad features shownAt ev'ry fair the country round;In ev'ry alehouse too they're found.His stick is pointed by each dunce"The ball would reach his brain at once!"And each says, o'er his beer and bread:"Thank Heav'n that 'tis not we are dead!"

　　1815.*-----PLAYING AT PRIESTS.

　　WITHIN a town where parityAccording to old form we see,--That is to say, where CatholicAnd Protestant no quarrels pick,And where, as in his father's day,Each worships God in his own way,We Luth'ran children used to dwell,By songs and sermons taught as well.The Catholic clingclang in truthSounded more pleasing to our youth,For all that we encounter'd there,To us seem'd varied, joyous, fair.As children, monkeys, and mankindTo ape each other are inclin'd,We soon, the time to while away,A game at priests resolved to play.Their aprons all our sisters lentFor copes, which gave us great content;And handkerchiefs, embroider'd o'er,Instead of stoles we also wore;Gold paper, whereon beasts were traced,The bishop's brow as mitre graced.

　　Through house and garden thus in stateWe strutted early, strutted late,Repeating with all proper unction,Incessantly each holy function.The best was wanting to the game;

　　We knew that a sonorous ring

　　Was here a most important thing;But Fortune to our rescue came,For on the ground a halter lay;

　　We were delighted, and at once

　　Made it a bellrope for the nonce,And kept it moving all the day;

　　In turns each sister and each brother

　　Acted as sexton to another;All help'd to swell the joyous throng;

　　The whole proceeded swimmingly,

　　And since no actual bell had we,We all in chorus sang, Ding dong!

　　*      *      *      *      *

　　Our guileless child's-sport long was hush'd

　　In memory's tomb, like some old lay;And yet across my mind it rush'd

　　With pristine force the other day.The New-Poetic CatholicsIn ev'ry point its aptness fix!

　　1815.*-----SONGS.

　　SONGS are like painted window-panes!In darkness wrapp'd the church remains,If from the market-place we view it;Thus sees the ignoramus through it.No wonder that he deems it tame,--And all his life 'twill be the same.

　　But let us now inside repair,And greet the holy Chapel there!At once the whole seems clear and bright,Each ornament is bathed in light,And fraught with meaning to the sight.God's children! thus your fortune prize,Be edified, and feast your eyes!

　　1827.*-----POETRY.

　　GOD to his untaught children sent

　　Law, order, knowledge, art, from high,And ev'ry heav'nly favour lent,

　　The world's hard lot to qualify.They knew not how they should behave,

　　For all from Heav'n stark-naked came;But Poetry their garments gave,

　　And then not one had cause for shame.

　　1816.-----A PARABLE.

　　I PICKED a rustic nosegay lately,And bore it homewards, musing greatly;When, heated by my hand, I foundThe heads all drooping tow'rd the ground.I plac'd them in a well-cool'd glass,And what a wonder came to passThe heads soon raised themselves once more.The stalks were blooming as before,And all were in as good a caseAs when they left their native place.

　　SHOULD e'er the loveless day remainObscured by storms of hail and rain,

　　Thy charms thou showest never;I tap at window, tap at door:Come, lov'd one, come! appear once more!

　　Thou art as fair as ever!

　　1827.*-----A PLAN THE MUSES ENTERTAINED.

　　A PLAN the Muses entertain'd

　　Methodically to impart

　　To Psyche the poetic art;Prosaic-pure her soul remain'd.No wondrous sounds escaped her lyre

　　E'en in the fairest Summer night;But Amor came with glance of fire,--

　　The lesson soon was learn'd aright.

　　1827.*-----THE DEATH OF THE FLY.

　　WITH eagerness he drinks the treach'rous potion,

　　Nor stops to rest, by the first taste misled;Sweet is the draught, but soon all power of motion

　　He finds has from his tender members fled;No longer has he strength to plume his wing,No longer strength to raise his head, poor thing!E'en in enjoyment's hour his life he loses,His little foot to bear his weight refuses;So on he sips, and ere his draught is o'er,Death veils his thousand eyes for evermore.

　　1810.-----BY THE RIVER.

　　WHEN by the broad stream thou dost dwell,

　　Oft shallow is its sluggish flood;Then, when thy fields thou tendest well,

　　It o'er them spreads its slime and mud.

　　The ships descend ere daylight wanes,

　　The prudent fisher upward goes;Round reef and rock ice casts its chains,

　　And boys at will the pathway close.

　　To this attend, then, carefully,

　　And what thou wouldst, that execute!Ne'er linger, ne'er o'erhasty be,

　　For time moves on with measured foot.

　　1821.*-----THE FOX AND CRANE.

　　ONCE two persons uninvited

　　Came to join my dinner table;For the nonce they lived united,

　　Fox and crane yclept in fable.

　　Civil greetings pass'd between us

　　Then I pluck'd some pigeons tenderFor the fox of jackal-genius,

　　Adding grapes in full-grown splendour.

　　Long-neck'd flasks I put as dishes

　　For the crane, without delaying,Fill'd with gold and silver fishes,

　　In the limpid water playing.

　　Had ye witness'd Reynard planted

　　At his flat plate, all demurely,Ye with envy must have granted:

　　"Ne'er was such a gourmand, surely!"

　　While the bird with circumspection

　　On one foot, as usual, cradled,From the flasks his fish-refection

　　With his bill and long neck ladled.

　　One the pigeons praised,--the other,

　　As they went, extoll'd the fishes,Each one scoffing at his brother

　　For preferring vulgar dishes.

　　*        *        *

　　If thou wouldst preserve thy credit,

　　When thou askest folks to guzzleAt thy hoard, take care to spread it

　　Suited both for bill and muzzle.

　　1819.-----THE FOX AND HUNTSMAN.

　　HARD 'tis on a fox's traces

　　To arrive, midst forest-glades;Hopeless utterly the chase is,

　　If his flight the huntsman aids.

　　And so 'tis with many a wonder,

　　(Why A B make Ab in fact,)Over which we gape and blunder,

　　And our head and brains distract.

　　1821.*-----THE FROGS.

　　A POOL was once congeal'd with frost;The frogs, in its deep waters lost,

　　No longer dared to croak or spring;But promised, being half asleep,If suffer'd to the air to creep,

　　As very nightingales to sing.

　　A thaw dissolved the ice so strong,--They proudly steer'd themselves along,When landed, squatted on the shore,And croak'd as loudly as before.

　　1821.*-----THE WEDDING.

　　A FEAST was in a village spread,--It was a wedding-day, they said.The parlour of the inn I found,And saw the couples whirling round,Each lass attended by her lad,And all seem'd loving, blithe, and glad;

　　But on my asking for the bride,A fellow with a stare, replied:"'Tis not the place that point to raise!

　　We're only dancing in her honour;We now have danced three nights and days,

　　And not bestowed one thought upon her."

　　*      *      *      *

　　Whoe'er in life employs his eyesSuch cases oft will recognise.

　　1821.*-----BURIAL.

　　To the grave one day from a house they bore

　　A maiden;To the window the citizens went to explore;In splendour they lived, and with wealth as of yore

　　Their banquets were laden.Then thought they: "The maid to the tomb is now borne;We too from our dwellings ere long must be torn,And he that is left our departure to mourn,

　　To our riches will be the successor,

　　For some one must be their possessor.

　　1827.*-----THREATENING SIGNS.

　　IF Venus in the evening skyIs seen in radiant majesty,If rod-like comets, red as blood,Are 'mongst the constellations view'd,Out springs the Ignoramus, yelling:"The star's exactly o'er my dwelling!What woeful prospect, ah, for me!Then calls his neighbour mournfully:"Behold that awful sign of evil,Portending woe to me, poor devil!My mother's asthma ne'er will leave her,My child is sick with wind and fever;I dread the illness of my wife,A week has pass'd, devoid of strife,--And other things have reach'd my ear;The Judgment Day has come, I fear!"

　　His neighbour answered: "Friend, you're right!Matters look very had to-night.Let's go a street or two, though, hence,And gaze upon the stars from thence."--No change appears in either case.Let each remain then in his place,And wisely do the best he can,Patient as any other man.

　　1821.*-----THE BUYERS.

　　To an apple-woman's stall

　　Once some children nimbly ran;Longing much to purchase all,They with joyous haste beganSnatching up the piles there raised,While with eager eyes they gazedOn the rosy fruit so nice;But when they found out the price,Down they threw the whole they'd got,Just as if they were red hot.

　　*      *      *      *      *

　　The man who gratis will his goods supplyWill never find a lack of folks to buy!

　　1820.-----THE MOUNTAIN VILLAGE.

　　"THE mountain village was destroy'd;But see how soon is fill'd the void!Shingles and boards, as by magic arise,The babe in his cradle and swaddling-clothes lies;How blest to trust to God's protection!"

　　Behold a wooden new erection,So that, if sparks and wind but choose,God's self at such a game must lose!

　　1821.*-----SYMBOLS.

　　PALM Sunday at the Vatican

　　They celebrate with palms;With reverence bows each holy man,

　　And chaunts the ancient psalms.Those very psalms are also sung

　　With olive boughs in hand,While holly, mountain wilds among,

　　In place of palms must stand:In fine, one seeks some twig that's green,

　　And takes a willow rod,So that the pious man may e'en

　　In small things praise his God.

　　And if ye have observed it well,

　　To gain what's fit ye're able,If ye in faith can but excel;

　　Such are the myths of fable.

　　1827.*-----THREE PALINODIAS.

　　I.

　　"Incense is hut a tribute for the gods,--To mortals 'tis but poison."

　　THE smoke that from thine altar blows,

　　Can it the gods offend?For I observe thou hold'st thy nose--

　　Pray what does this portend?Mankind deem incense to excel

　　Each other earthly thing,So he that cannot bear its smell,

　　No incense e'er should bring.

　　With unmoved face by thee at least

　　To dolls is homage given;If not obstructed by the priest,

　　The scent mounts up to heaven.

　　1827.*

　　II

　　CONFLICT OF WIT AND BEAUTY.

　　SIR Wit, who is so much esteem'd,

　　And who is worthy of all honour,Saw Beauty his superior deem'd

　　By folks who loved to gaze upon her;At this he was most sorely vex'd.

　　Then came Sir Breath (long known as fit

　　To represent the cause of wit),

　　Beginning, rudely, I admit,To treat the lady with a text.To this she hearken'd not at all,But hasten'd to his principal:"None are so wise, they say, as you,--Is not the world enough for two?

　　If you are obstinate, good-bye!If wise, to love me you will try,For be assured the world can ne'erGive birth to a more handsome pair."

　　1827.*

　　=====

　　FAIR daughters were by Beauty rear'd,

　　Wit had but dull sons for his lot;So for a season it appear'd

　　Beauty was constant, Wit was not.But Wit's a native of the soil,

　　So he return'd, work'd, strove amain,And found--sweet guerdon for his toil!--

　　Beauty to quicken him again.

　　1827.*

　　III.

　　RAIN AND RAINBOW.

　　DURING a heavy storm it chancedThat from his room a cockney glancedAt the fierce tempest as it broke,While to his neighbour thus he spoke:"The thunder has our awe inspired,Our barns by lightning have been fired,--Our sins to punish, I suppose;But in return, to soothe our woes,See how the rain in torrents fell,Making the harvest promise well!But is't a rainbow that I spyExtending o'er the dark-grey sky?With it I'm sure we may dispense,The colour'd cheat! The vain pretence!"Dame Iris straightway thus replied:"Dost dare my beauty to deride?In realms of space God station'd meA type of better worlds to beTo eyes that from life's sorrows roveIn cheerful hope to Heav'n above,And, through the mists that hover hereGod and his precepts blest revere.Do thou, then, grovel like the swine,And to the ground thy snout confine,But suffer the enlighten'd eyeTo feast upon my majesty."

　　1827.*

　　VALEDICTION.

　　I ONCE was fond of fools,

　　And bid them come each day;Then each one brought his tools

　　The carpenter to play;The roof to strip first choosing,

　　Another to supply,The wood as trestles using,

　　To move it by-and-by,While here and there they ran,

　　And knock'd against each other;To fret I soon began,

　　My anger could not smother,So cried, "Get out, ye fools!"

　　At this they were offendedThen each one took his tools,

　　And so our friendship ended.

　　Since that, I've wiser been,

　　And sit beside my door;When one of them is seen,

　　I cry, "Appear no more!""Hence, stupid knave!" I bellow:

　　At this he's angry too:"You impudent old fellow!

　　And pray, sir, who are you?Along the streets we riot,

　　And revel at the fair;But yet we're pretty quiet,

　　And folks revile us ne'er.Don't call us names, then, please!"--At length I meet with ease,

　　For now they leave my door--'Tis better than before!

　　1827.*-----THE COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER.

　　I.

　　A MASTER of a country schoolJump'd up one day from off his stool,Inspired with firm resolve to tryTo gain the best society;So to the nearest baths he walk'd,And into the saloon he stalk'd.He felt quite. startled at the door,Ne'er having seen the like before.To the first stranger made he nowA very low and graceful bow,But quite forgot to bear in mindThat people also stood behind;His left-hand neighbor's paunch he struckA grievous blow, by great ill luck;Pardon for this he first entreated,And then in haste his bow repeated.His right hand neighbor next he hit,And begg'd him, too, to pardon it;But on his granting his petition,Another was in like condition;These compliments he paid to all,Behind, before, across the hall;At length one who could stand no more,Show'd him impatiently the door.

　　*      *      *      *

　　May many, pond'ring on their crimes,A moral draw from this betimes!

　　II.

　　As he proceeded on his wayHe thought, "I was too weak to-day;To bow I'll ne'er again be seen;For goats will swallow what is green."Across the fields he now must speed,Not over stumps and stones, indeed,But over meads and cornfields sweet,Trampling down all with clumsy feet.A farmer met him by-and-by,And didn't ask him: how? or why?But with his fist saluted him.

　　"I feel new life in every limb!"Our traveller cried in ecstasy."Who art thou who thus gladden'st me?May Heaven such blessings ever send!Ne'er may I want a jovial friend!"

　　1808.*-----THE LEGEND OF THE HORSESHOE.

　　WHAT time our Lord still walk'd the earth,Unknown, despised, of humble birth,And on Him many a youth attended(His words they seldom comprehended),It ever seem'd to Him most meetTo hold His court in open street,As under heaven's broad canopyOne speaks with greater liberty.The teachings of His blessed wordFrom out His holy mouth were heard;Each market to a fane turn'd HeWith parable and simile.

　　One day, as tow'rd a town He roved,In peace of mind with those He loved,Upon the path a something gleam'd;A broken horseshoe 'twas, it seem'd.So to St. Peter thus He spake:"That piece of iron prythee take!"St. Peter's thoughts had gone astray,--He had been musing on his wayRespecting the world's government,A dream that always gives content,For in the head 'tis check'd by nought;This ever was his dearest thought,For him this prize was far too meanHad it a crown and sceptre been!But, surely, 'twasn't worth the troubleFor half a horseshoe to bend double!And so he turn'd away his head,As if he heard not what was said,

　　The Lord, forbearing tow'rd all men,Himself pick'd up the horseshoe then(He ne'er again like this stoop'd down).And when at length they reach'd the town,Before a smithy He remain'd,And there a penny for 't obtain'd.As they the market-place went by,Some beauteous cherries caught His eye:Accordingly He bought as manyAs could be purchased for a penny,And then, as oft His wont had been,Placed them within His sleeve unseen.

　　They went out by another gate,O'er plains and fields proceeding straight,No house or tree was near the spot,The sun was bright, the day was hot;In short, the weather being such,A draught of water was worth much.The Lord walk'd on before them all,And let, unseen, a cherry fall.St. Peter rush'd to seize it hold,As though an apple 'twere of gold;His palate much approv'd the berry;The Lord ere long another cherryOnce more let fall upon the plain;St. Peter forthwith stoop'd again.The Lord kept making him thus bendTo pick up cherries without end.For a long time the thing went on;The Lord then said, in cheerful tone:"Had'st thou but moved when thou wert bid,Thou of this trouble had'st been rid;The man who small things scorns, will next,By things still smaller be perplex'd."

　　WHEN Minerva, to give pleasureTo Prometheus, her well-loved one,Brought a brimming bowl of nectarFrom the glorious realms of heavenAs a blessing for his creatures,And to pour into their bosomsImpulses for arts ennobling,She with rapid footstep hasten'd,Fearing Jupiter might see her,And the golden goblet trembled,And there fell a few drops from itOn the verdant plain beneath her.Then the busy bees flew thitherStraightway, eagerly to drink them,And the butterfly came quicklyThat he, too, might find a drop there;Even the misshapen spiderThither crawl'd and suck'd with vigour.

　　To a happy end they tasted,They, and other gentle insects!For with mortals now divide theyArtthat noblest gift of all.

　　".... With mournful majesiyA heap of solitary ruins lie,Half sepulchred in dust, the bankrupt heirTo prodigal antiquity...."-----LOVE AS A LANDSCAPE PAINTER.

　　ON a rocky peak once sat I early,Gazing on the mist with eyes unmoving;Stretch'd out like a pall of greyish texture,All things round, and all above it cover'd.

　　Suddenly a boy appear'd beside me,Saying "Friend, what meanest thou by gazingOn the vacant pall with such composure?Hast thou lost for evermore all pleasureBoth in painting cunningly, and forming?"On the child I gazed, and thought in secret:"Would the boy pretend to be a master?"

　　"Wouldst thou be for ever dull and idle,"Said the boy, "no wisdom thou'lt attain to;See, I'll straightway paint for thee a figure,--How to paint a beauteous figure, show thee."

　　And he then extended his fore-finger,--(Ruddy was it as a youthful rosebud)Tow'rd the broad and far outstretching carpet,And began to draw there with his finger.

　　First on high a radiant sun he painted,Which upon mine eyes with splendour glisten'd,And he made the clouds with golden border,Through the clouds he let the sunbeams enter;Painted then the soft and feathery summitsOf the fresh and quicken'd trees, behind themOne by one with freedom drew the mountains;Underneath he left no lack of water,But the river painted so like Nature,That it seem'd to glitter in the sunbeams,That it seem'd against its banks to murmur.

　　Ah, there blossom'd flowers beside the river,And bright colours gleam'd upon the meadow,Gold, and green, and purple, and enamell'd,All like carbuncles and emeralds seeming!

　　Bright and clear he added then the heavens,And the blue-tinged mountains far and farther,So that I, as though newborn, enrapturedGazed on, now the painter, now the picture.

　　Then spake he: "Although I have convinced theeThat this art I understand full surely,Yet the hardest still is left to show thee."

　　Thereupon he traced, with pointed finger,And with anxious care, upon the forest,At the utmost verge, where the strong sunbeamsFrom the shining ground appear'd reflected,

　　Traced the figure of a lovely maiden,Fair in form, and clad in graceful fashion,Fresh the cheeks beneath her brown locks' ambush,And the cheeks possess'd the selfsame colourAs the finger that had served to paint them.

　　"Oh thou boy!" exclaim'd I then, "what masterIn his school received thee as his pupil,Teaching thee so truthfully and quicklyWisely to begin, and well to finish?"

　　Whilst I still was speaking, lo, a zephyrSoftly rose, and set the tree-tops moving,Curling all the wavelets on the river,And the perfect maiden's veil, too, fill'd it,And to make my wonderment still greater,Soon the maiden set her foot in motion.On she came, approaching tow'rd the stationWhere still sat I with my arch instructor.

　　As now all, yes, all thus moved together,--Flowers, river, trees, the veil,--all moving,--And the gentle foot of that most fair one,Can ye think that on my rock I linger'd,Like a rock, as though fast-chain'd and silent?

　　Step by step guided on, changeth to blossom and fruit!First from the seed it unravels itself, as soon as the silent

　　Fruit-bearing womb of the earth kindly allows Its escape,And to the charms of the light, the holy, the ever-in-motion,

　　Trusteth the delicate leaves, feebly beginning to shoot.Simply slumber'd the force in the seed; a germ of the future,

　　Peacefully lock'd in itself, 'neath the integument lay,Leaf and root, and bud, still void of colour, and shapeless;

　　Thus doth the kernel, while dry, cover that motionless life.Upward then strives it to swell, in gentle moisture confiding,

　　And, from the night where it dwelt, straightway ascendeth to light.Yet still simple remaineth its figure, when first it appeareth;

　　And 'tis a token like this, points out the child 'mid the plants.Soon a shoot, succeeding it, riseth on high, and reneweth,

　　Piling-up node upon node, ever the primitive form;Yet not ever alike: for the following leaf, as thou seest,

　　Ever produceth itself, fashioned in manifold ways.Longer, more indented, in points and in parts more divided,

　　Which. all-deform'd until now, slept in the organ below,So at length it attaineth the noble and destined perfection,

　　Which, in full many a tribe, fills thee with wondering awe.Many ribb'd and tooth'd, on a surface juicy and swelling,

　　Free and unending the shoot seemeth in fullness to be;Yet here Nature restraineth, with powerful hands, the formation,

　　And to a perfecter end, guideth with softness its growth,Less abundantly yielding the sap, contracting the vessels,

　　So that the figure ere long gentler effects doth disclose.Soon and in silence is check'd the growth of the vigorous branches,

　　And the rib of the stalk fuller becometh in form.Leafless, however, and quick the tenderer stem then up-springeth,

　　And a miraculous sight doth the observer enchant.Ranged in a circle, in numbers that now are small, and now countless,

　　Gather the smaller-sized leaves, close by the side of their like.Round the axis compress'd the sheltering calyx unfoldeth,

　　And, as the perfectest type, brilliant-hued coronals forms.Thus doth Nature bloom, in glory still nobler and fuller,

　　Showing, in order arranged, member on member uprear'd.Wonderment fresh dost thou feel, as soon as the stem rears the flower

　　Over the scaffolding frail of the alternating leaves.But this glory is only the new creation's foreteller,

　　Yes, the leaf with its hues feeleth the hand all divine,And on a sudden contracteth itself; the tenderest figures

　　Twofold as yet, hasten on, destined to blend into one.Lovingly now the beauteous pairs are standing together,

　　Gather'd in countless array, there where the altar is raised.Hymen hovereth o'er them, and scents delicious and mighty

　　Stream forth their fragrance so sweet, all things enliv'ning around.Presently, parcell'd out, unnumber'd germs are seen swelling,

　　Sweetly conceald in the womb, where is made perfect the fruit.Here doth Nature close the ring of her forces eternal;

　　Yet doth a new one, at once, cling to the one gone before,So that the chain be prolonged for ever through all generations,

　　And that the whole may have life, e'en as enjoy'd by each part.Now, my beloved one, turn thy gaze on the many-hued thousands

　　Which, confusing no more, gladden the mind as they wave.Every plant unto thee proclaimeth the laws everlasting,

　　Every flowered speaks louder and louder to thee;But if thou here canst decipher the mystic words of the goddess,

　　Everywhere will they be seen, e'en though the features are changed.Creeping insects may linger, the eager butterfly hasten,--

　　Plastic and forming, may man change e'en the figure decreed!Oh, then, bethink thee, as well, how out of the germ of acquaintance,

　　Kindly intercourse sprang, slowly unfolding its leaves;Soon how friendship with might unveil'd itself in our bosoms,

　　And how Amor, at length, brought forth blossom and fruitThink of the manifold ways wherein Nature hath lent to our feelings,

　　Silently giving them birth, either the first or the last!Yes, and rejoice in the present day! For love that is holy

　　Seeketh the noblest of fruits,--that where the thoughts are the same,Where the opinions agree,--that the pair may, in rapt contemplation,

　　Lovingly blend into one,--find the more excellent world.

　　-----THOUGHTS ON JESUS CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO HELL.

　　[THE remarkable Poem of which this is a literal but faintrepresentation, was written when Goethe was only sixteen yearsold. It derives additional interest from the fact of its beingthe very earliest piece of his that is preserved. The few otherpieces included by Goethe under the title of Religion and Churchare polemical, and devoid of interest to the English reader.]

　　WHAT wondrous noise is heard around!Through heaven exulting voices sound,

　　A mighty army marches onBy thousand millions follow'd, lo,To yon dark place makes haste to go

　　God's Son, descending from His throne!He goes--the tempests round Him break,

　　As Judge and Hero cometh He;He goes--the constellations quake,

　　The sun, the world quake fearfully.

　　I see Him in His victor-car,On fiery axles borne afar,

　　Who on the cross for us expired.The triumph to yon realms He shows,--Remote from earth, where star ne'er glows,

　　The triumph He for us acquired.He cometh, Hell to extirpate,

　　Whom He, by dying, wellnigh kill'd;He shall pronounce her fearful fate

　　Hark! now the curse is straight fulfill'd.

　　Hell sees the victor come at last,She feels that now her reign is past,

　　She quakes and fears to meet His sight;She knows His thunders' terrors dread,In vain she seeks to hide her head,

　　Attempts to fly, but vain is flight;Vainly she hastes to 'scape pursuit

　　And to avoid her Judge's eye;The Lord's fierce wrath restrains her foot

　　Like brazen chains,--she cannot fly.

　　Here lies the Dragon, trampled down,He lies, and feels God's angry frown,

　　He feels, and grinneth hideously;He feels Hell's speechless agonies,A thousand times he howls and sighs:

　　"Oh, burning flames! quick, swallow me!"There lies he in the fiery waves,

　　By torments rack'd and pangs infernal,Instant annihilation craves,

　　And hears, those pangs will be eternal.

　　Those mighty squadrons, too, are here,The partners of his cursed career,

　　Yet far less bad than he were they.Here lies the countless throng combined,In black and fearful crowds entwined,

　　While round him fiery tempests play;He sees how they the Judge avoid,

　　He sees the storm upon them feed,Yet is not at the sight o'erjoy'd,

　　Because his pangs e'en theirs exceed.

　　The Son of Man in triumph passesDown to Hell's wild and black morasses,

　　And there unfolds His majesty.Hell cannot bear the bright array,For, since her first created day.

　　Darkness alone e'er govern'd she.She lay remote from ev'ry light

　　With torments fill'd in Chaos here;God turn'd for ever from her sight

　　His radiant features' glory clear.

　　Within the realms she calls her own,She sees the splendour of the Son,

　　His dreaded glories shining forth;She sees Him clad in rolling thunder,She sees the rocks all quake with wonder,

　　When God before her stands in wrath.She sees He comes her Judge to be,

　　She feels the awful pangs inside her,Herself to slay endeavours she,

　　But e'en this comfort is denied her.

　　Now looks she back, with pains untold,Upon those happy times of old,

　　When those glories gave her joy;When yet her heart revered the truth,When her glad soul, in endless youth

　　And rapture dwelt, without alloy.She calls to mind with madden'd thought

　　How over man her wiles prevail'd;To take revenge on God she sought,

　　And feels the vengeance it entail'd.

　　God was made man, and came to earth.Then Satan cried with fearful mirth:

　　"E'en He my victim now shall be!"He sought to slay the Lord Most High,The world's Creator now must die;

　　But, Satan, endless woe to thee!Thou thought'st to overcome Him then,

　　Rejoicing in His suffering;But he in triumph comes again

　　To bind thee: Death! where is thy sting?

　　Speak, Hell! where is thy victory?Thy power destroy'd and scatter'd see!

　　Know'st thou not now the Highest's might?See, Satan, see thy rule o'erthrown!

　　By thousand-varying pangs weigh'd down,Thou dwell'st in dark and endless night.

　　As though by lightning struck thou liest,No gleam of rapture far or wide;

　　In vain! no hope thou there decriest,--For me alone Messiah died!

　　A howling rises through the air,A trembling fills each dark vault there,

　　When Christ to Hell is seen to come.She snarls with rage, but needs must cowerBefore our mighty hero's power;

　　He signs--and Hell is straightway dumb.Before his voice the thunders break,

　　On high His victor-banner blows;E'en angels at His fury quake,

　　When Christ to the dread judgment goes.

　　Now speaks He, and His voice is thunder,He speaks, the rocks are rent in sunder,

　　His breath is like devouring flames.Thus speaks He: "Tremble, ye accurs'd!He who from Eden hurl'd you erst,

　　Your kingdom's overthrow proclaims.Look up! My children once were ye,

　　Your arms against Me then ye turn'd,Ye fell, that ye might sinners be,

　　Ye've now the wages that ye earn'd.

　　"My greatest foeman from that day,Ye led my dearest friends astray,--

　　As ye had fallen, man must fall.To kill him evermore ye sought,'They all shall die the death,' ye thought;

　　But howl! for Me I won them all.For them alone did I descend,

　　For them pray'd, suffer'd, perish'd I.Ye ne'er shall gain your wicked end;

　　Who trusts in Me shall never die.

　　"In endless chains here lie ye now,Nothing can save you from the slough.

　　Not boldness, not regret for crime.Lie, then, and writhe in brimstone fire!'Twas ye yourselves drew down Mine ire,

　　Lie and lament throughout all time!And also ye, whom I selected,

　　E'en ye forever I disown,For ye My saving grace rejected

　　Ye murmur? blame yourselves alone!

　　"Ye might have lived with Me in bliss,For I of yore had promis'd this;

　　Ye sinn'd, and all My precepts slightedWrapp'd in the sleep of sin ye dwelt,Now is My fearful judgment felt,

　　By a just doom your guilt requited."--Thus spake He, and a fearful storm

　　From Him proceeds, the lightnings glow,The thunders seize each wicked form,

　　And hurl them in the gulf below.

　　The God-man closeth Hell's sad doors,In all His majesty He soars

　　From those dark regions back to light.He sitteth at the Father's side;Oh, friends, what joy doth this betide!

　　For us, for us He still will fight!The angels sacred quire around

　　Rejoice before the mighty Lord,So that all creatures hear the sound:

　　"Zebaoth's God be aye ador'd!"

　　ANTIQUES.

　　-----LEOPOLD, DUKE OF BRUNSWICK.

　　[Written on the occasion of the death, by drowning, of thePrince.]

　　THOU wert forcibly seized by the hoary lord of the river,--

　　Holding thee, ever he shares with thee his streaming domain,Calmly sleepest thou near his urn as it silently trickles,

　　Till thou to action art roused, waked by the swift-rolling flood.Kindly be to the people, as when thou still wert a mortal,

　　Perfecting that as a god, which thou didst fail in, as man.

　　1785.-----TO THE HUSBANDMAN.

　　SMOOTHLY and lightly the golden seed by the furrow is cover'd;

　　Yet will a deeper one, friend, cover thy bones at the last.Joyously plough'd and sow'd! Here food all living is budding,

　　E'en from the side of the tomb Hope will not vanish away.

　　1789.*-----ANACREON'S GRAVE.

　　HERE where the roses blossom, where vines round the laurels are twining,

　　Where the turtle-dove calls, where the blithe cricket is heard,Say, whose grave can this be, with life by all the Immortals

　　Beauteously planted and deck'd?--Here doth Anacreon sleepSpring and summer and autumn rejoiced the thrice-happy minstrel,

　　And from the winter this mound kindly hath screen'd him at last.

　　1789.*-----THE BRETHREN.

　　SLUMBER and Sleep, two brethren ordain'd by the gods to their service,

　　Were by Prometheus implored, comfort to give to his race;But though so light to the gods, too heavy for man was their burden,

　　We in their slumber find sleep, we in their sleep meet with death.

　　1789.*-----MEASURE OF TIME.

　　EROS, what mean'st thou by this? In each of thine hands is an hourglass!

　　What, oh thou frivolous god! twofold thy measure of time?"Slowly run from the one, the hours of lovers when parted;

　　While through the other they rush swiftly, as soon as they meet."

　　1789.*-----WARNING.

　　WAKEN not Amor from sleep! The beauteous urchin still slumbers;

　　Go, and complete thou the task, that to the day is assign'd!Thus doth the prudent mother with care turn time to her profit,

　　While her babe is asleep, for 'twill awake but too soon.

　　1785.*-----SOLITUDE.

　　OH ye kindly nymphs, who dwell 'mongst the rocks and the thickets,

　　Grant unto each whatsoe'er he may in silence desire!Comfort impart to the mourner, and give to the doubter instruction,

　　And let the lover rejoice, finding the bliss that he craves.For from the gods ye received what they ever denied unto mortals,

　　Power to comfort and aid all who in you may confide.

　　1782.-----THE CHOSEN CLIFF.

　　HERE in silence the lover fondly mused on his loved one;

　　Gladly he spake to me thus: "Be thou my witness, thou stone!Yet thou must not be vainglorious, thou hast many companions;

　　Unto each rock on the plain, where I, the happy one, dwell,Unto each tree of the wood that I cling to, as onward I ramble,

　　'Be thou a sign of my bliss!' shout I, and then 'tis ordain'd.Yet to thee only I lend a voice, as a Muse from the people

　　Chooseth one for herself, kissing his lips as a friend."

　　1782.-----THE CONSECRATED SPOT.

　　WHEN in the dance of the Nymphs, in the moonlight so holy assembled,

　　Mingle the Graces, down from Olympus in secret descending,Here doth the minstrel hide, and list to their numbers enthralling,

　　Here doth he watch their silent dances' mysterious measure.All that is glorious in Heaven, and all that the earth in her beauty

　　Ever hath brought into life, the dreamer awake sees before him;All he repeats to the Muses, and lest the gods should be anger'd,

　　How to tell of secrets discreetly, the Muses instruct him.

　　1789.*-----THE INSTRUCTORS.

　　WHEN Diogenes quietly sunn'd himself in his barrel,

　　When Calanus with joy leapt in the flame-breathing grave,Oh, what noble lessons were those for the rash son of Philip,

　　Were not the lord of the world e'en for instruction too great!

　　WOULDST thou the blossoms of spring, as well as the fruits of the autumn,

　　All that is needed is done, when I Sakontala name.

　　1792.-----THE MUSE'S MIRROR.

　　EARLY one day, the Muse, when eagerly bent on adornment,Follow'd a swift-running streamlet, the quietest nook by it seeking.Quickly and noisily flowing, the changeful surface distortedEver her moving form; the goddess departed in anger.Yet the stream call'd mockingly after her, saying: "What, truly!Wilt thou not view, then, the truth, in my mirror so clearly depicted?"But she already was far away, on the brink of the ocean,In her figure rejoicing, and duly arranging her garland.

　　1799.*-----PHOEBUS AND HERMES.

　　DELOS' stately ruler, and Maia's son, the adroit one,

　　Warmly were striving, for both sought the great prize to obtain.Hermes the lyre demanded, the lyre was claim'd by Apollo,

　　Yet were the hearts of the foes fruitlessly nourish'd by hope.For on a sudden Ares burst in, with fury decisive,

　　Dashing in twain the gold toy, brandishing wildly his sword.Hermes, malicious one, laughed beyond measure; yet deep-seated sorrow

　　Seized upon Phoebus's heart, seized on the heart of each Muse.

　　1799.*-----THE NEW AMOR.

　　AMOR, not the child, the youthful lover of Psyche,Look'd round Olympus one day, boldly, to triumph inured;There  he espied a goddess, the fairest amongst the immortals,--Venus Urania she,--straight was his passion inflamed.Even the holy one powerless proved, alas! 'gainst his wooing,--Tightly embraced in his arm, held her the daring one fast.Then from their union arose a new, a more beauteous Amor,Who from his father his wit, grace from his mother derives.Ever thou'lt find him join'd in the kindly Muses' communion,And his charm-laden bolt foundeth the love of the arts.

　　1792.-----THE GARLANDS.

　　KLOPSTOCK would lead us away from Pindus; no longer for laurelMay we be eager--the homely acorn alone must content us;Yet he himself his more-than-epic crusade is conductingHigh on Golgotha's summit, that foreign gods he may honour!Yet, on what hill he prefers, let him gather the angels together,Suffer deserted disciples to weep o'er the grave of the just one:There where a hero and saint hath died, where a bard breath'd his numbers,Both for our life and our death an ensample of courage resplendentAnd of the loftiest human worth to bequeath,--ev'ry nationThere will joyously kneel in devotion ecstatic, reveringThorn and laurel garland, and all its charms and its tortures.

　　1815.*-----THE SWISS ALPS.

　　YESTERDAY brown was still thy head, as the locks of my loved one,

　　Whose sweet image so dear silently beckons afar.Silver-grey is the early snow to-day on thy summit,

　　Through the tempestuous night streaming fast over thy brow.Youth, alas, throughout life as closely to age is united

　　As, in some changeable dream, yesterday blends with to-day.

　　Uri, October 7th, 1797.-----DISTICHS.

　　CHORDS are touch'd by Apollo,--the death-laden bow, too, he bendeth;

　　While he the shepherdess charms, Python he lays in the dust.-----WHAT is merciful censure? To make thy faults appear smaller?

　　May be to veil them? No, no! O'er them to raise thee on high!-----DEMOCRATIC food soon cloys on the multitude's stomach;But I'll wager, ere long, other thou'lt give them instead.-----WHAT in France has pass'd by, the Germans continue to practise,

　　For the proudest of men flatters the people and fawns.-----WHO is the happiest of men? He who values the merits of others,And in their pleasure takes joy, even as though 'twere his own.-----NOT in the morning alone, not only at mid-day he charmeth;

　　Even at setting, the sun is still the same glorious planet.-----

　　VENETIAN EPIGRAMS.(Written in 1790.)-----URN and sarcophagus erst were with life adorn'd by the heathen

　　Fauns are dancing around, while with the Bacchanal troopChequerd circles they trace; and the goat-footed, puffy-cheekd player

　　Wildly produceth hoarse tones out of the clamorous horn.Cymbals and drums resound; we see and we hear, too, the marble.

　　Fluttering bird! oh how sweet tastes the ripe fruit to thy bill!Noise there is none to disturb thee, still less to scare away Amor,

　　Who, in the midst of the throng, learns to delight in his torch.Thus doth fullness overcome death; and the ashes there cover'd

　　Seem, in that silent domain, still to be gladdend with life.Thus may the minstrel's sarcophagus be hereafter surrounded

　　With such a scroll, which himself richly with life has adorn'd.-----CLASP'D in my arms for ever eagerly hold I my mistress,

　　Ever my panting heart throbs wildly against her dear breast,And on her knees forever is leaning my head, while I'm gazing

　　Now  on her sweet-smiling mouth, now on her bright sparkling eyes."Oh thou effeminate!" spake one, "and thus, then, thy days thou

　　art spending?"

　　Ah, they in sorrow are spent. List while I tell thee my tale:Yes! I have left my only joy in life far behind me,

　　Twenty long days hath my car borne me away from her sight.Vettrini defy me, while crafty chamberlains flatter,

　　And the sly Valet de place thinks but of lies and deceit.If I attempt to escape, the Postmaster fastens upon me,

　　Postboys the upper hand get, custom-house duties enrage."Truly, I can't understand thee! thou talkest enigmas! thou seemest

　　Wrapp'd in a blissful repose, glad as Rinaldo of yore:Ah, I  myself understand full well; 'tis my body that travels,

　　And 'tis my spirit that rests still in my mistress's arms.-----I WOULD liken this gondola unto the soft-rocking cradle,

　　And the chest on its deck seems a vast coffin to be.Yes! 'tween the cradle and coffin, we totter and waver for ever

　　On the mighty canal, careless our lifetime is spent.-----WHY are the people thus busily moving? For food they are seeking,

　　Children they fain would beget, feeding them well as they can.Traveller, mark this well, and when thou art home, do thou likewise!

　　More can no mortal effect, work with what ardour he will.-----I WOULD compare to the land this anvil, its lord to the hammer,

　　And to the people the plate, which in the middle is bent.Sad is the poor tin-plate's lot, when the blows are but given at random:

　　Ne'er will the kettle be made, while they uncertainly fall.-----WHAT is the life of a man? Yet thousands are ever accustom'dFreely to talk about man,--what he has done, too, and how.Even less is a poem; yet thousands read and enjoy it,Thousands abuse it.--My friend, live and continue to rhyme!-----MERRY'S the trade of a poet; but somewhat a dear one, I fear me

　　For, as my book grows apace, all of my sequins I lose.-----Is' thou'rt in earnest, no longer delay, but render me happy;Art thou in jest? Ah, sweet love! time for all jesting is past.-----ART thou, then, vex'd at my silence? What shall I speak of? Thou markest

　　Neither my sorrowful sigh, nor my soft eloquent look.Only one goddess is able the seal of my lips to unloosen,--

　　When by Aurora I'm found, slumbering calm on thy breast.Ah, then my hymn in the ears of the earliest gods shall be chaunted,

　　As the Memnonian form breath'd forth sweet secrets in song.-----IN the twilight of morning to climb to the top of the mountain,--

　　Thee to salute, kindly star, earliest herald of day,--And to await, with impatience, the gaze of the ruler of heaven,--

　　Youthful delight, oh oft lur'st thou me out in the night!Oh ye heralds of day, ye heavenly eyes of my mistress,

　　Now ye appear, and the sun evermore riseth too soon.-----THOU art amazed, and dost point to the ocean. It seems to be burning,Flame-crested billows in play dart round our night-moving bark.Me it astonisheth not,--of the ocean was born Aphrodite,--Did not a flame, too, proceed from her for us, in her son?-----GLEAMING the ocean appear'd, the beauteous billows were smiling,

　　While a fresh, favouring wind, filling the sails, drove us on.Free was my bosom from yearning; yet soon my languishing glances

　　Turn'd themselves backward in haste, seeking the snow-cover'd hills.Treasures unnumber'd are southwards lying. Yet one to the northwards

　　Draws me resistlessly back, like the strong magnet in force.-----SPACIOUS and fair is the world; yet oh! how I thank the kind heavens

　　That I a garden possess, small though it be, yet mine own.One which enticeth me homewards; why should a gardener wander?

　　Honour and pleasure he finds, when to his garden he looks.-----AH, my maiden is going! she mounts the vessel! My monarch,

　　AEolus! potentate dread! keep ev'ry storm far away!"Oh, thou fool!" cried the god:"ne'er fear the blustering tempest;

　　When Love flutters his wings, then mayst thou dread the soft breeze."-----

　　ELEGIES.

　　-----PART I.

　　ROMAN ELEGIES.

　　[The Roman Elegies were written in the same year as the VenetianEpigrams--viz. 1790.]

　　SPEAK, ye stones, I entreat! Oh speak, ye palaces lofty!

　　Utter a word, oh ye streets! Wilt thou not, Genius, awake?All that thy sacred walls, eternal Rome, hold within them

　　Teemeth with life; but to me, all is still silent and dead.Oh, who will whisper unto me,--when shall I see at the casement

　　That one beauteous form, which, while it scorcheth, revives?Can I as yet not discern the road, on which I for ever

　　To her and from her shall go, heeding not time as it flies?Still do I mark the churches, palaces, ruins, and columns,

　　As a wise traveller should, would he his journey improve.Soon all this will be past; and then will there be but one temple,

　　Amor's temple alone, where the Initiate may go.Thou art indeed a world, oh Rome; and yet, were Love absent,

　　Then would the world be no world, then would e'en Rome be no Rome.-----Do not repent, mine own love, that thou so soon didst surrender

　　Trust me, I deem thee not bold! reverence only I feel.Manifold workings the darts of Amor possess; some but scratching,

　　Yet with insidious effect, poison the bosom for years.Others mightily feather'd, with fresh and newly-born sharpness

　　Pierce to the innermost bone, kindle the blood into flame.In the heroical times, when loved each god and each goddess,

　　Longing attended on sight; then with fruition was bless'd.Think'st thou the goddess had long been thinking of love and its pleasures

　　When she, in Ida's retreats, own'd to Anchises her flame?Had but Luna delayd to kiss the beautiful sleeper,

　　Oh, by Aurora, ere long, he had in envy been rous'd!Hero Leander espied at the noisy feast, and the lover

　　Hotly and nimbly, ere long, plunged in the night-cover'd flood.Rhea Silvia, virgin princess, roam'd near the Tiber,

　　Seeking there water to draw, when by the god she was seiz'd.Thus were the sons of Mars begotten! The twins did a she-wolf

　　Suckle and nurture,--and Rome call'd herself queen of the world,-----ALEXANDER, and Caesar, and Henry, and Fred'rick, the mighty,

　　On me would gladly bestow half of the glory they earn'd,Could I but grant unto each one night on the couch where I'm lying;

　　But they, by Orcus's night, sternly, alas! are held down.Therefore rejoice, oh thou living one, blest in thy love-lighted homestead,

　　Ere the dark Lethe's sad wave wetteth thy fugitive foot.-----THESE few leaves, oh ye Graces, a bard presents, in your honour,

　　On your altar so pure, adding sweet rosebuds as well,And he does it with hope. The artist is glad in his workshop,

　　When a Pantheon it seems round him for ever to bring.Jupiter knits his godlike brow,--her's, Juno up-lifteth;

　　Phoebus strides on before, shaking his curly-lock'd headCalmly and drily Minerva looks down, and Hermes the light one,

　　Turneth his glances aside, roguish and tender at once.But tow'rds Bacchus, the yielding, the dreaming, raiseth Cythere

　　Looks both longing and sweet, e'en in the marble yet moist.Of his embraces she thinks with delight, and seems to be asking

　　"Should not our glorious son take up his place by our side?"-----AMOR is ever a rogue, and all who believe him are cheated!

　　To me the hypocrite came: "Trust me, I pray thee, this once.Honest is now my intent,--with grateful thanks I acknowledge

　　That thou thy life and thy works hast to my worship ordain'd.See, I have follow'd thee thither, to Rome, with kindly intention,

　　Hoping to give thee mine aid, e'en in the foreigner's land.Every trav'ller complains that the quarters he meets with are wretched

　　Happily lodged, though, is he, who is by Amor receiv'd.Thou dost observe the ruins of ancient buildings with wonder,

　　Thoughtfully wandering on, over each time-hallow'd spot.Thou dost honour still more the worthy relics created

　　By the few artists--whom I loved in their studios to seek.I 'twas fashion'd those forms! thy pardon,--I boast not at present;

　　Presently thou shalt confess, that what I tell thee is true.Now that thou serv'st me more idly, where are the beauteous figures,

　　Where are the colours, the light, which thy creations once fill'd?Hast thou a mind again to form? The school of the Grecians

　　Still remains open, my friend; years have not barr'd up its doors.I, the teacher, am ever young, and love all the youthful,

　　Love not the subtle and old; Mother, observe what I say!Still was new the Antique, when yonder blest ones were living;

　　Happily live,--and, in thee, ages long vanish'd will live!Food for song, where hop'st thou to find it? I only can give it,

　　And a more excellent style, love, and love only can teach."Thus did the Sophist discourse. What mortal, alas! could resist him?

　　And when a master commands, I have been train'd to obey.Now he deceitfully keeps his word, gives food for my numbers,

　　But, while he does so, alas! robs me of time, strength, and mind.Looks, and pressure of hands, and words of kindness, and kisses,

　　Syllables teeming with thought, by a fond pair are exchang'd.Then becomes whispering, talk,--and stamm'ring, a language enchanting;

　　Free from all prosody's rules, dies such a hymn on the ear.Thee, Aurora, I used to own as the friend of the Muses;

　　Hath, then, Amor the rogue cheated, Aurora, e'en thee?Thou dost appear to me now as his friend, and again dost awake me

　　Unto a day of delight, while at his altar I kneel.All her locks I find on my bosom, her head is reposing,

　　Pressing with softness the arm, which round her neck is entwin'd;Oh! what a joyous awak'ning, ye hours so peaceful, succeeded,

　　Monument sweet of the bliss which had first rock'd us to sleepIn her slumber she moves, and sinks, while her face is averted,

　　Far on the breadth of the couch, leaving her hand still in mineHeartfelt love unites us for ever, and yearnings unsullied,

　　And our cravings alone claim for themselves the exchange.One faint touch of the hand, and her eyes so heavenly see I

　　Once more open. Ah, no! let me still look on that form!Closed still remain! Ye make me confused and drunken, ye rob me

　　Far too soon of the bliss pure contemplation affords.Mighty, indeed, are these figures! these limbs, how gracefully rounded!

　　Theseus, could'st thou e'er fly, whilst Ariadne thus slept?Only one single kiss on these lips! Oh, Theseus, now leave us!

　　Gaze on her eyes! she awakes--Firmly she holds thee embrac'd-----PART II.

　　ALEXIS AND DORA.

　　[This beautiful poem was first published in Schiller's Horen.]

　　FARTHER and farther away, alas! at each moment the vessel

　　Hastens, as onward it glides, cleaving the foam-cover'd flood!Long is the track plough'd up by the keel where dolphins are sporting,

　　Following fast in its rear, while it seems flying pursuit.All forebodes a prosperous voyage; the sailor with calmness

　　Leans 'gainst the sail, which alone all that is needed performs.Forward presses the heart of each seamen, like colours and streamers;

　　Backward one only is seen, mournfully fix'd near the mast,While on the blue tinged mountains, which fast are receding, he gazeth,

　　And as they sink in the sea, joy from his bosom departs.Vanish'd from thee, too, oh Dora, is now the vessel that robs thee

　　Of thine Alexis, thy friend,--ah, thy betrothed as well!Thou, too, art after me gazing in vain. Our hearts are still throbbing,

　　Though, for each other, yet ah! 'gainst one another no more.Oh, thou single moment, wherein I found life! thou outweighest

　　Every day which had else coldly from memory fled.'Twas in that moment alone, the last, that upon me descended

　　Life, such as deities grant, though thou perceived'st it not.Phoebus, in vain with thy rays dost thou clothe the ether in glory:

　　Thine all-brightening day hateful alone is to me.Into myself I retreat for shelter, and there, in the silence,

　　Strive to recover the time when she appear'd with each day.Was it possible beauty like this to see, and not feel it?

　　Work'd not those heavenly charms e'en on a mind dull as thine?Blame not thyself, unhappy one! Oft doth the bard an enigma

　　Thus propose to the throng, skillfully hidden in words.Each one enjoys the strange commingling of images graceful,

　　Yet still is wanting the word which will discover the sense.When at length it is found, the heart of each hearer is gladden'd,

　　And in the poem he sees meaning of twofold delight.Wherefore so late didst thou remove the bandage, oh Amor,

　　Which thou hadst placed o'er mine eyes,--wherefore remove it so late?Long did the vessel, when laden, lie waiting for favouring breezes,

　　'Till in kindness the wind blew from the land o'er the sea.Vacant times of youth! and vacant dreams of the future!

　　Ye all vanish, and nought, saving the moment, remains.Yes! it remains,--my joy still remains! I hold thee; my Dora,

　　And thine image alone, Dora, by hope is disclos'd.Oft have I seen thee go, with modesty clad, to the temple,

　　While thy mother so dear solemnly went by thy side.Eager  and nimble thou wert, in bearing thy fruit to the market,

　　Boldly the pail from the well didst thou sustain on thy head.Then was reveal'd thy neck, then seen thy shoulders so beauteous,

　　Then, before all things, the grace filling thy motions was seen.Oft have I fear'd that the pitcher perchance was in danger of falling,

　　Yet it ever remain'd firm on the circular cloth.Thus, fair neighbour, yes, thus I oft was wont to observe thee,

　　As on the stars I might gaze, as I might gaze on the moon,Glad indeed at the sight, yet feeling within my calm bosom

　　Not the remotest desire ever to call them mine own.Years thus fleeted away! Although our houses were only

　　Twenty paces apart, yet I thy threshold ne'er cross'd.Now by the fearful flood are we parted! Thou liest to Heaven,

　　Billow! thy beautiful blue seems to me dark as the night.All were now in movement; a boy to the house of my father

　　Ran at full speed and exclaim'd: "Hasten thee quick to the strandHoisted the sail is already, e'en now in the wind it is flutt'ring,

　　While the anchor they weigh, heaving it up from the sand;Come, Alexis, oh come!"--My worthy stout-hearted father

　　Press'd, with a blessing, his hand down on my curly-lock'd head,While my mother carefully reach'd me a newly-made bundle,

　　"Happy mayst thou return!" cried they--" both happy and rich!"Then I sprang away, and under my arm held the bundle,

　　Running along by the wall. Standing I found thee hard by,At the door of thy garden. Thou smilingly saidst then "Alexis!

　　Say, are yon boisterous crew going thy comrades to be?Foreign coasts will thou visit, and precious merchandise purchase,

　　Ornaments meet for the rich matrons who dwell in the town.Bring me, also, I praythee, a light chain; gladly I'll pay thee,

　　Oft have I wish'd to possess some stich a trinket as that."There I remain'd, and ask'd, as merchants are wont, with precision

　　After the form and the weight which thy commission should have.Modest, indeed, was the price thou didst name! I meanwhile was gazing

　　On thy neck which deserv'd ornaments worn but by queens.Loudly now rose the cry from the ship; then kindly thou spakest

　　"Take, I entreat thee, some fruit out of the garden, my friendTake the ripest oranges, figs of the whitest; the ocean

　　Beareth no fruit, and, in truth, 'tis not produced by each land."So I entered in. Thou pluckedst the fruit from the branches,

　　And the burden of gold was in thine apron upheld.Oft did I cry, Enough! But fairer fruits were still falling

　　Into the hand as I spake, ever obeying thy touch.Presently didst thou reached the arbour; there lay there a basket,

　　Sweet blooming myrtle trees wav'd, as we drew nigh, o'er our heads.Then thou began'st to arrange the fruit with skill and in silence:

　　First the orange, which lay heavy as though 'twere of gold,Then the yielding fig, by the slightest pressure disfigur'd,

　　And with myrtle the gift soon was both cover'd and grac'd.But I raised it not up. I stood. Our eyes met together,

　　And my eyesight grew dim, seeming obscured by a film,Soon I felt thy bosom on mine! Mine arm was soon twining

　　Round thy beautiful form; thousand times kiss'd I thy neck.On my shoulder sank thy head; thy fair arms, encircling,

　　Soon rendered perfect the ring knitting the rapturous pair.Amor's hands I felt: he press'd us together with ardour,

　　And, from the firmament clear, thrice did it thunder; then tearsStream'd from mine eyes in torrents, thou weptest, I wept, both were weeping,

　　And, 'mid our sorrow and bliss, even the world seem'd to die.Louder and louder they calI'd from the strand; my feet would no longer

　　Bear my weight, and I cried:--"Dora! and art thou not mine?""Thine forever!" thou gently didst say. Then the tears we were shedding

　　Seem'd to be wiped from our eyes, as by the breath of a god.Nearer was heard the cry "Alexis!" The stripling who sought me

　　Suddenly peep'd through the door. How he the basket snatch'd up!How he urged me away! how press'd I thy hand! Wouldst thou ask me

　　How the vessel I reach'd? Drunken I seem'd, well I know.Drunken my shipmates believed me, and so had pity upon me;

　　And as the breeze drove us on, distance the town soon obscur'd."Thine for ever!" thou, Dora, didst murmur; it fell on my senses

　　With the thunder of Zeus! while by the thunderer's throneStood his daughter, the Goddess of Love; the Graces were standing

　　Close by her side! so the bond beareth an impress divine!Oh then hasten, thou ship, with every favouring zephyr!

　　Onward, thou powerful keel, cleaving the waves as they foam!Bring me unto the foreign harbour, so that the goldsmith

　　May in his workshop prepare straightway the heavenly pledge!Ay, of a truth, the chain shall indeed be a chain, oh my Dora!

　　Nine times encircling thy neck, loosely around it entwin'dOther and manifold trinkets I'll buy thee; gold-mounted bracelets,

　　Richly and skillfully wrought, also shall grace thy fair hand.There shall the ruby and emerald vie, the sapphire so lovely

　　Be to the jacinth oppos'd, seeming its foil; while the goldHolds all the jewels together, in beauteous union commingled.

　　Oh, how the bridegroom exults, when he adorns his betroth'd!Pearls if I see, of thee they remind me; each ring that is shown me

　　Brings to my mind thy fair hand's graceful and tapering form.I will barter and buy; the fairest of all shalt thou choose thee,

　　Joyously would I devote all of the cargo to thee.Yet not trinkets and jewels alone is thy loved one procuring;

　　With them he brings thee whate'er gives to a housewife delight.Fine and woollen coverlets, wrought with an edging of purple,

　　Fit for a couch where we both, lovingly, gently may rest;Costly pieces of linen. Thou sittest and sewest, and clothest

　　Me, and thyself, and, perchance, even a third with it too.Visions of hope, deceive ye my heart! Ye kindly Immortals,

　　Soften this fierce-raging flame, wildly pervading my breast!Yet how I long to feel them again, those rapturous torments.

　　When, in their stead, care draws nigh, coldly and fearfully calm.Neither the Furies' torch, nor the hounds of hell with their harking

　　Awe the delinquent so much, down in the plains of despair,As by the motionless spectre I'm awed, that shows me the fair one

　　Far away: of a truth, open the garden-door stands!And another one cometh! For him the fruit, too, is falling,

　　And for him, also, the fig strengthening honey doth yield!Doth she entice him as well to the arbour? He follows? Oh, make me

　　Blind, ye Immortals! efface visions like this from my mind!Yes, she is but a maiden! And she who to one doth so quickly

　　Yield, to another ere long, doubtless, Will turn herself round.Smile not, Zeus, for this once, at an oath so cruelly broken!

　　Thunder more fearfully! Strike!--Stay--thy fierce lightnings withhold!Hurl at me thy quivering bolt! In the darkness of midnight

　　Strike with thy lightning this mast, make it a pitiful wreck!Scatter the planks all around, and give to the boisterous billows

　　All these wares, and let me be to the dolphins a preyNow, ye Muses, enough! In vain would ye strive to depicture

　　How, in a love-laden breast, anguish alternates with bliss.Ye cannot heal the wounds, it is true, that love hath inflicted;

　　Yet from you only proceeds, kindly ones, comfort and balm.

　　FATE AND SYMPATHY.

　　"NE'ER have I seen the market and streets so thoroughly empty!Still as the grave is the town, clear'd out! I verily fancyFifty at most of all our inhabitants still may be found there.People are so inquisitive! All are running and racingMerely to see the sad train of poor fellows driven to exile.Down to the causeway now building, the distance nearly a league is,And they thitherward rush, in the heat and the dust of the noonday.As for me, I had rather not stir from my place just to stare atWorthy and sorrowful fugitives, who, with what goods they can carry,Leaving their own fair land on the further side of the Rhine-stream,Over to us are crossing, and wander through the delightfulNooks of this fruitful vale, with all its twistings and windings.Wife, you did right well to bid our son go and meet them,Taking with him old linen, and something to eat and to drink too,Just to give to the poor; the rich are bound to befriend them.How he is driving along! How well he holds in the horses!Then the new little carriage looks very handsome; inside itFour can easily sit, besides the one on the coachbox.This time he is alone; how easily-turns it the corner!"Thus to his wife the host of the Golden Lion discoursed,Sitting at ease in the porch of his house adjoining the market.Then replied as follows the shrewd and sensible hostess"Father, I don't like giving old linen away, for I find itUseful in so many ways, 'tis not to he purchased for moneyJust when it's wanted. And yet to-day I gladly have givenMany excellent articles, shirts and covers and suchlike;For I have heard of old people and children walking half-naked.Will you forgive me, too, for having ransacked your presses?That grand dressing-gown, cover'd with Indian flowers all over,Made of the finest calico, lined with excellent flannel,I have despatch'd with the rest; 'tis thin, old, quite out of fashion."

　　But the worthy landlord only smiled, and then answer'dI shall dreadfully miss that ancient calico garment,Genuine Indian stuff! They're not to be had any longer.Well! I shall wear it no more. And your poor husband henceforwardAlways must wear a surtout, I suppose, or commonplace jacket,Always must put on his boots; good bye to cap and to slippers!"

　　"See," continued his wife, "a few are already returningWho have seen the procession, which long ago must have pass'd by.See how dusty their shoes are, and how their faces are glowingEach one carries a handkerchief, wiping the sweat from his forehead.I, for one, wouldn't hurry and worry myself in such weatherMerely to see such a sight! I'm certain to hear all about it."

　　And the worthy father, speaking with emphasis, added"Such fine weather seldom lasts through the whole of the harvestAnd we're bringing the fruit home, just as the hay we brought lately,Perfectly dry; the sky is clear, no cloud's in the heavens,And the whole day long delicious breezes are blowing.Splendid weather I call it! The corn already too ripe is,And to-morrow begin we to gather the plentiful harvest."

　　Whilst he was thus discoursing, the number of men and of womenCrossing the market and going towards home kept ever increasing;And there return'd amongst others, bringing with him his daughters,On the other side of the market, their prosperous neighbour,Going full speed to his newbuilt house, the principal merchant,Riding inside an open carriage (in Landau constructed).All the streets were alive; for the town, though small, was well peopled,Many a factory throve there, and many a business also.

　　Long sat the excellent couple under the doorway, exchangingMany a passing remark on the people who happen'd to pass them.Presently thus to her husband exclaim'd the good-natured hostess"See! Yon comes the minister; with him is walking the druggist:They'll be able to give an account of all that has happen'd,What they witness'd, and many a sight I fear which was painful."

　　Both of them came in a friendly manner, and greeted the couple,Taking their seats on the wooden benches under the doorway,Shaking the dust from their feet, their handkerchiefs using to fan them.Presently, after exchanging reciprocal greetings, the druggistOpen'd his mouth, and almost peevishly vented his feelings"What strange creatures men are! They all resemble each other,All take pleasure in staring, when troubles fall on their neighbours.Ev'ry one runs to see the flames destroying a dwelling,Or a poor criminal led in terror and shame to the scaffold.All the town has been out to gaze at the sorrowing exiles,None of them bearing in mind that a like misfortune hereafter,Possibly almost directly, may happen to be their own portion.I can't pardon such levity; yet 'tis the nature of all men."Thereupon rejoin'd the noble and excellent pastor,He, the charm of the town, in age scarce more than a stripling:--(He was acquainted with life, and knew the wants of his hearers,Fully convinced of the worth of the Holy Scriptures, whose missionIs to reveal man's fate, his inclinations to fathom;He was also well read in the best of secular writings.)"I don't like to find fault with any innocent impulseWhich in the mind of man Dame Nature has ever implanted;For what reason and intellect ne'er could accomplish, is oftenDone by some fortunate, quite irresistible instinct within him.If mankind were never by curiosity driven,Say, could they e'er have found out for themselves the wonderful mannerThings in the world range in order? For first they Novelty look for,Then with untiring industry seek to discover the Useful,Lastly they yearn for the Good, which makes them noble and worthy.All through their youth frivolity serves as their joyous companion,Hiding the presence of danger, and. swiftly effacing the tracesCaused by misfortune and grief, as soon as their onslaught is over.Truly the man's to be praised who, as years roll onward, developsOut of such glad disposition an intellect settled and steady,--Who, in good fortune as well as misfortune, strives zealously, nobly;For what is Good he brings forth, replacing whatever is injured."Then in a friendly voice impatiently spoke thus the hostess:--"Tell us what have you seen; I am eagerly longing to hear it."

　　Then with emphasis answer'd the druggist:--" The terrible storiesTold me to-day will serve for a long time to make me unhappy.Words would fail to describe the manifold pictures of mis'ry.Far in the distance saw we the dust, before we descendedDown to the meadows; the rising hillocks hid the processionLong from our eyes, and little could we distinguish about it.When, however, we reach'd the road that winds thro' the valley,Great was the crowd and the noise of the emigrants mix'd with the waggons.We unhappily saw poor fellows passing in numbers,Some of them showing how bitter the sense of their sorrowful flight was,Some with a feeling of joy at saving their lives in a hurry.Sad was the sight of the manifold goods and chattels pertainingUnto a well-managed house, which the careful owner's accustom'dEach in its proper position to place, and in regular order,Always ready for use, for all are wanted and useful.--Sad was the sight of them now, on many a waggon and barrowHeap'd in thorough confusion, and hurriedly huddled together.Over a cupboard was placed a sieve and a coverlet woollen;Beds in the kneeding troughs lay, and linen over the glasses.Ah! and the danger appear'd to rob the men of their senses,Just as in our great fire of twenty years ago happen'd,When what was worthless they saved, and left all the best things behind them.So on the present occasion with heedless caution they carriedMany valueless chattels, o'erlading the cattle and horses,--Common old boards and barrels, a birdcage next to a goosepen.Women and children were gasping beneath the weight of their bundles,Baskets and tubs full of utterly useless articles, bearing.(Man is always unwilling the least of his goods to abandon.)Thus on its dusty way advanced the crowded procession,All in hopeless confusion. First one, whose cattle were weaker,Fain would slowly advance, while others would eagerly hasten.Then there arose a scream of half-crush'd women and children,And a lowing of cattle, with yelping of dogs intermingled,And a wailing of aged and sick, all sitting and shaking,Ranged in their beds on the top of the waggon too-heavily laden.Next some lumbering wheel, push'd out of the track by the pressure,Went to the edge of the roadway; the vehicle fell in the ditch then,Rolling right over, and throwing, in falling, the men who were in itFar in the field, screaming loudly, their persons however uninjured.Then the boxes roll'd off and tumbled close to the waggon.Those who saw them failing full surely expected to see themSmash'd to pieces beneath the weight of the chests and the presses.So the waggon lay broken, and those that it carried were helpless,For the rest of the train went on, and hurriedly pass'd them,Thinking only of self, and carried away by the current.So we sped to the spot, and found the sick and the agedWho, when at home and in bed, could scarcely endure their sad ailments,Lying there on the ground, all sighing and groaning in anguish,Stifled by clouds of dust, and scorch'd by the fierce sun of summer.

　　Then replied in tones of compassion the sensitive landlordHermann I trust will find them and give them refreshment and clothing.I should unwillingly see them: I grieve at the eight of such sorrow.Touch'd by the earliest news of the sad extent of the suffering,Hastily sent we a trifle from out of our superabundance,Just to comfort a few, and then our minds were more easy.Now let us cease to discourse on such a sorrowful subject,For men's hearts are easily overshadow'd by terror,And by care, more odious far to me than misfortune.Now let us go to a cooler place, the little back-parlour;There the sun never shines, and the walls are so thick that the hot airNever can enter; and mother shall forthwith bring us a glass eachFull of fine Eighty-three, well fitted to drive away trouble.This is a bad place for drinking; the flies will hum round the glasses."So they all went inside, enjoying themselves in the coolness.Then in a well-cut flask the mother carefully brought themSome of that clear good wine, upon a bright metal waiterWith those greenish rummers, the fittingest goblets for Rhine wine.So the three sat together, around the glistening polish'dCircular large brown table-on massive feet it was planted.Merrily clink'd together the glasses of host and of pastor,But the other one thoughtfully held his glass without moving,And in friendly fashion the host thus ask'd him to join them:--

　　"Drink, good neighbour, I pray! A merciful God has protectedUs in the past from misfortune, and will protect us in future.All must confess that since He thought fit to severely chastise us,When that terrible fire occurr'd, He has constantly bless'd us.And watch'd over us constantly, just as man is accustom'dHis eye's precious apple to guard, that dearest of members.Shall He not for the future preserve us, and be our Protector?For 'tis in danger we learn to appreciate duly His Goodness.This so flourishing town, which He built again from its ashesBy the industrious hands of its burghers, and bless'd it so richly,Will He again destroy it, and render their toil unavailing?"

　　Cheerfully answer'd the excellent pastor, in accents of mildness"Steadfastly cling to this faith, and cherish such worthy opinions;In good fortune they'll make you prudent, and then in misfortuneWell-grounded hopes they'll supply, and furnish you true consolation."

　　Then continued the host, with thoughts full of manhood and wisdom"Oft have I greeted with wonder the rolling flood of the Rhine stream,When, on my business trav'lling, I've once more come to its borders.Grand has it ever appear'd, exalting my feelings and senses;But I could never imagine that soon its beautiful marginInto a wall would be turn'd, to keep the French from our country,And its wide-spreading bed a ditch to hinder and check them.So by Nature we're guarded, we're guarded by valorous Germans,And by the Lord we're guarded; who then would foolishly tremble?Weary the combatants are, and all things indicate peace soon;And when at length the long-expected festival's holdenHere in our church, and the bells chime in with the organ in chorus,And the trumpets are blowing, the noble Te Deum upraising,Then on that selfsame day I fain would see, my good pastor,Our dear Hermann kneel with his bride at the altar before you,And the glad festival held through the length and breadth of the countryWill henceforward to me be a glad anniversary also!But I am grieved to observe that the youth, who is always so activeWhen he is here at home, abroad is so slow and so timid.Little at any time cares he to mix with the rest of the people;Yes, he even avoids young maidens' society ever,And the frolicsome dance, that great delight of young people."

　　Thus he spake, and then listen'd. The sound of the stamping of horsesDrawing nearer was heard; and then the roll of the carriage,Which, with impetuous speed, now thunder'd under the gateway.-----II.  TERPSICHORE.

　　HERMANN.

　　THEN when into the room the well-built son made his entry,Straightway with piercing glances the minister eyed him intently,And with carefulness watch'd his looks and the whole of his bearing,With an inquiring eye which easily faces decyphers;Then he smiled, and with cordial words address'd him as follows"How you are changed in appearance, my friend! I never have seen youHalf so lively before; your looks are thoroughly cheerful.You have return'd quite joyous and merry. You've doubtless dividedAll of the presents amongst the poor, their blessings receiving."

　　Then in calm accents replied the son, with gravity speaking"Whether I've laudably acted, I know not; I follow'd the impulseOf my own heart, as now I'll proceed to describe with exactness.Mother, you rummaged so long, in looking over old pieces,And in making your choice, that 'twas late when the bundle was ready,And the wine and the beer were slowly and carefully pack'd up.When I at length emerged at the gate, and came on the highway,Streams of citizens met I returning, with women and children,For the train of the exiles had long disappear'd in the distance.So I quicken'd my pace, and hastily drove to the villageWhere I had heard that to-night to rest and to sleep they intended.Well, as I went on my way, the newly-made causeway ascending,Suddenly saw I a waggon, of excellent timber constructed,Drawn by a couple of oxen, the best and the strongest of foreign.Close beside it there walk'd, with sturdy footsteps, a maiden,Guiding the two strong beasts with a long kind of staff, which with skill sheKnew how to use, now driving, and now restraining their progress.When the maiden observed me, she quietly came near the horses,And address'd me as follows:--'Our usual condition, believe me,Is not so sad as perchance you might judge from our present appearance.I am not yet accustom'd to ask for alms from a stranger,Who so often but gives, to rid himself of a beggar.But I'm compell'd to speak by necessity. Here on the straw nowLies the lately-confined poor wife of a wealthy landowner,Whom with much trouble I managed to save with oxen and waggon.We were late in arriving, and scarcely with life she escaped.Now the newly-born child in her arms is lying, all naked,And our friends will be able to give them but little assistance,E'en if in the next village, to which to-night we are going,We should still find them, although I fear they have left it already.If you belong to the neighbourhood, any available linenThese poor people will deem a most acceptable present.

　　"Thus she spake, and wearily raised herself the pale patientUp from the straw and gazed upon me, while thus I made answer'Oft doth a heavenly spirit whisper to kind-hearted people,So that they feel the distress o'er their poorer brethren impending;For my mother, your troubles foreboding, gave me a bundleReady prepared for relieving the wants of those who were naked.'Then I loosen'd the knots of the cord, and the dressing-gown gave herWhich belong'd to my father, and gave her some shirts and some linen,And she thank'd me with joy and said:--'The fortunate know notHow 'tis that miracles happen; we only discover in sorrowGod's protecting finger and hand, extended to beckonGood men to good. May your kindness to us by Him be requited.'And I saw the poor patient joyfully handling the linen,Valuing most of all the soft flannel, the dressing-gown lining.Then the maid thus address'd her:--'Now let us haste to the villageWhere our friends are resting, to-night intending to sleep thereThere I will straightway attend to what e'er for the infant is needed.'Then she saluted me too, her thanks most heartily giving,Drove the oxen, the waggon went on. I lingerd behind them,Holding my horses rein'd back, divided between two opinions,Whether to hasten ahead, reach the village, the viands distribute'Mongst the rest of the people, or give them forthwith to the maiden,So that she might herself divide them amongst them with prudenceSoon I made up my mind, and follow'd after her softly,Overtook her without delay, and said to her quickly'Maiden, it was not linen alone that my mother providedAnd in the carriage placed, as clothing to give to the naked,But she added meat, and many an excellent drink too;And I have got quite a stock stow'd away in the boot of the carriage.Well, I have taken a fancy the rest of the gifts to depositIn your hands, and thus fulfil to the best my commission;You will divide them with prudence, whilst I my fate am obeying.'Then the maiden replied:--'With faithfulness I will distributeAll your gifts, and the needy shall surely rejoice at your bounty.'Thus she spake, and I hastily open'd the boot of the carriage,Took out the hams (full heavy they were) and took out the bread-stuffs,Flasks of wine and beer, and handed the whole of them over.Gladly would I have given her more, but empty the boot was.Straightway she pack'd them away at the feet of the patient, and forthwithStarted again, whilst I hasten'd back to the town with my horses."

　　Then when Hermann had ended his story, the garrulous neighbourOpen'd his mouth and exclaim'd:--"I only deem the man happyWho lives alone in his house in these days of flight and confusion,Who has neither wife nor children cringing beside himI feel happy at present; I hate the title of father;Care of children and wife in these days would be a sad drawback.Often have I bethought me of flight, and have gather'd togetherAll that I deem most precious, the antique gold and the jewelsWorn by my late dear mother, not one of which has been sold yet.Much indeed is left out, that is not so easily carried.Even the herbs and the roots, collected with plenty of trouble,I should he sorry to lose, though little in value they may be.If the dispenser remains, I shall leave my house in good spiritsIf my ready money is saved, and my body, why trulyAll is saved, for a bachelor easily flies when 'tis needed."

　　"Neighbour," rejoin'd forthwith young Hermann, with emphasis speaking"Altogether I differ, and greatly blame your opinions.Can that man be deem'd worthy, who both in good and ill fortuneThinks alone of himself, and knows not the secret of sharingSorrows and joys with others, and feels no longing to do so?I could more easily now than before determine to marryMany an excellent maiden needs a husband's protection,Many a man a cheerful wife, when sorrow's before him."Smilingly said then the father:--"I'm pleas'd to hear what you're saying,Words of such wisdom have seldom been utter'd by you in my presence.

　　Then his good mother broke in, in her turn, with vivacity speaking"Son, you are certainly right. We parents set the example.'Twas not in time of pleasure that we made choice of each other,And 'twas the saddest of hours, that knitted us closely together.Monday morning,--how well I remember! the very day afterThat most terrible fire occurr'd which burnt down the borough,Twenty years ago now; the day, like to-day, was a Sunday,Hot and dry was the weather, and little available water.All the inhabitants, clothed in their festival garments, were walking,Scatter'd about in the inns and the mills of the neighbouring hamlets.At one end of the town the fire broke out, and the flames ranHastily all through the streets, impell'd by the draught they created.And the barns were consumed, where all the rich harvest was gather'dAnd all the streets as far as the market; the dwelling house alsoOf my father hard by was destroy'd, as likewise was this one.Little indeed could we save; I sat the sorrowful night throughOn the green of the town, protecting the beds and the boxes.Finally sleep overtook me, and when by the cool breeze of morningWhich dies away when the sun arises I was awaken'd,Saw I the smoke and the glow, and the half-consumed walls and the chimneys.Then my heart was sorely afflicted; but soon in his gloryRose the sun more brilliant than ever, my spirits reviving.Then in haste I arose, impell'd the site to revisitWhere our dwelling had stood, to see if the chickens were livingWhich I especially loved; for childlike I still was by nature.But when over the ruins of courtyard and house I was climbing,Which still smoked, and saw my dwelling destroy'd and deserted,You came up on the other side, the ruins exploring.You had a horse shut up in his stall; the still-glowing raftersOver it lay, and rubbish, and nought could be seen of the creature.Over against each other we stood, in doubt and in sorrow,For the wall had fallen which used to sever our courtyards;And you grasp'd my hand, addressing me softly as follows'Lizzy, what here are you doing? Away! Your soles you are burning,For the rubbish is hot, and is scorching my boots which are thicker.'Then you lifted me up, and carried me off through your courtyard.There still stood the gateway before the house, with its arch'd roof,Just as it now is standing, the only thing left remaining.And you sat me down and kiss'd me, and I tried to stop you,But you presently said, with kindly words full of meaning'See, my house is destroy'd! Stop here and help me to build it,I in return will help to rebuild the house of your father.'I understood you not, till you sent to my father your mother,And ere long our marriage fulfilid the troth we soon plighted.Still to this day I remember with pleasure the half-consumed rafters,Still do I see the sun in all his majesty rising,For on that day I gain'd my husband; the son of my youth tooGained I during that earliest time of the wild desolation.Therefore commend I you, Hermann, for having with confidence guilelessTurn'd towards marriage your thoughts in such a period of mourning,And for daring to woo in war and over the ruins.--"

　　Then the father straightway replied, with eagerness speaking:--"Sensible is your opinion, and true is also the storyWhich you have told us, good mother, for so did ev'rything happen.But what is better is better. 'Tis not the fortune of all menAll their life and existence to find decided beforehand;All are not doom'd to such troubles as we and others have suffer'd.O, how happy is he whose careful father and motherHave a house ready to give him, which he can successfully manage!All beginnings are hard, and most so the landlords profession.Numberless things a man must have, and ev'rything dailyDearer becomes, so he needs to scrape together more money.So I am hoping that you, dear Hermann, will shortly be bringingHome to us a bride possessing an excellent dowry,For a worthy husband deserves a girl who is wealthy,And 'tis a capital thing for the wish'd-for wife to bring with herPlenty of suitable articles stow'd in her baskets and boxes.Not in vain for years does the mother prepare for her daughterStocks of all kinds of linen, both finest and strongest in texture;Not in vain do god-parents give them presents of silver,Or the father lay by in his desk a few pieces of money.For she hereafter will gladden, with all her goods and possessions,That happy youth who is destined from out of all others to choose her.Yes! I know how pleasant it makes a house for a young wife,When she finds her own property placed in the rooms and the kitchen,And when she herself has cover'd the bed and the table.Only well-to-do brides should be seen in a house, I consider,For a poor one is sure at last to be scorn'd by her husband,And he'll deem her a jade who as jade first appear'd with her bundle.Men are always unjust, but moments of love are but transient.Yes, my Hermann, you greatly would cheer the old age of your fatherIf you soon would bring home a daughter-in-law to console me,Out of the neighbourhood too,--yes, out of yon dwelling, the green one!Rich is the man, in truth his trade and his manufacturesMake him daily richer, for when does a merchant not prosper?He has only three daughters; the whole of his wealth they'll inherit.True the eldest's already engaged; but then there's the second,And the third, who still (not for long) may be had for the asking.Had I been in your place, I should not till this time have waited;Bring home one of the girls, as I brought your mother before you.

　　Then, with modesty, answer'd the son his impetuous father"Truly my wish was, like yours, to marry one of the daughtersOf our neighbour. We all, in fact, were brought up together,Sported in youthful days near the fountain adjoining the market,And from the rudeness of boys I often managed to save them.But those days have long pass'd the maidens grew up, and with reasonStop now at home and avoid the rougher pastimes of childhood.Well brought up with a vengeance they are! To please you, I sometimesWent to visit them, just for the sake of olden acquaintanceBut I was never much pleased at holding intercourse with them,For they were always finding fault, and I had to bear itFirst my coat was too long, the cloth too coarse, and the colourFar too common, my hair was cut and curl'd very badly.I at last was thinking of dressing myself like the shop-boys,Who are accustom'd on Sundays to show off their persons up yonder,And round whose coats in summer half-silken tatters are hanging.But ere long I discover'd they only intended to fool meThis was very annoying, my pride was offended, but more stillFelt I deeply wounded that they so mistook the good feelingsWhich I cherish'd towards them, especially Minnie, the youngest.Well, I went last Easter, politely to pay them a visit,And I wore the new coat now hanging up in the closet,And was frizzled and curld, like all the rest of the youngsters.When I enter'd, they titter'd; but that didn't very much matter.Minnie sat at the piano, the father was present amongst them,Pleased with his daughter's singing, and quite in a jocular humour.Little could I understand of the words in the song she was singing,But I constantly heard of Pamina, and then of Tamino,*

　　(* Characters In Mozart's Zauberflote.)And I fain would express my opinion; so when she had ended,I ask'd questions respecting the text, and who were the persons.All were silent and smiled; but presently answer'd the father'Did you e'er happen, my friend, to hear of Eve or of Adam?'Then no longer restrain'd they themselves, the girls burst out laughing,All the boys laugh'd loudly, the old man's sides appear'd splitting.In my confusion I let my hat fall down, and the titt'ringLasted all the time the singing and playing continued.Then I hasten'd home, ashamed and full of vexation,Hung up my coat in the closet, and put my hair in disorderWith my fingers, and swore ne'er again to cross o'er their threshold.And I'm sure I was right; for they are all vain and unloving.And I hear they're so rude as to give me the nickname Tamino."Then the mother rejoin'd:--"You're wrong, dear Hermann, to harbourAngry feelings against the children, for they are but children.Minnie's an excellent girl, and has a tenderness for you;Lately she ask'd how you were. Indeed, I wish you would choose her!"

　　Then the son thoughtfully answer'd:--"I know not why, but the fact isMy annoyance has graven itself in my mind, and hereafterI could not bear at the piano to see her, or list to her singing."

　　But the father sprang up, and said, in words full of anger"Little comfort you give me, in truth! I always have said it,When you took pleasure in horses, and cared for nothing but fieldwork;That which the servants of prosperous people perform as their duty,You yourself do; meanwhile the father his son must dispense with,Who in his honour was wont to court the rest of the townsfolk.Thus with empty hopes your mother early deceived me,When your reading, and writing, and learning at school ne'er succeededLike the rest of the boys, and so you were always the lowest.This all comes from a youth not possessing a due sense of honour,And not having the spirit to try and raise his position.Had my father but cared for me, as I have for you, sir,Sent me to school betimes, and given me proper instructors,I should not merely have been the host of the famed Golden Lion."

　　But the son arose, and approach'd the doorway in silence,Slowly, and making no noise: but then the father in dudgeonAfter him shouted:--"Be off! I know you're an obstinate fellow!Go and look after the business; else I shall scold you severely;But don't fancy I'll ever allow you to bring home in triumphAs my daughter-in-law any boorish impudent hussy.Long have I lived in the world, and know how to manage most people,Know how to entertain ladies and gentlemen, so that they leave meIn good humour, and know how to flatter a stranger discreetly.But my daughter-in-law must have useful qualities also,And be able to soften my manifold cares and vexations.She must also play on the piano, that all the best peopleHere in the town may take pleasure in often coming to see us,As in the house of our neighbour the merchant happens each Sunday."Softly the son at these words raised the latch, and left the apartment.-----III. THALIA.

　　THE BURGHERS.

　　THUS did the prudent son escape from the hot conversation,But the father continued precisely as he had begun itWhat is not in a man can never come out of him, surely!Never, I fear, shall I see fulfill'd my dearest of wishes,That my son should be unlike his father, but better.What would be the fate of a house or a town, if its inmatesDid not all take pride in preserving, renewing, improving,As we are taught by the age, and by the wisdom of strangers?Man is not born to spring out of the ground, just like a mere mushroom,And to rot away soon in the very place that produced him!Leaving behind him no trace of what he has done in his lifetime.One can judge by the look of a house of the taste of its master,As on ent'ring a town, one can judge the authorities' fitness.For where the towers and walls are falling, where in the ditchesDirt is collected, and dirt in every street is seen lying,Where the stones come out of their groove, and are not replaced there,Where the beams are rotting, and vainly the houses are waitingNew supports; that town is sure to be wretchedly managed.For where order and cleanliness reign not supreme in high places,Then to dirt and delay the citizens soon get accustom'd,Just as the beggar's accustom'd to wear his cloths full of tatters.Therefore I often have wish'd that Hermann would start on his travelsEre he's much older, and visit at any rate Strasburg and Frankfort,And that pleasant town, Mannheim, so evenly built and so cheerful.He who has seen such large and cleanly cities rests neverTill his own native town, however small, he sees better'd.Do not all strangers who visit us praise our well-mended gateways,And the well-whited tower, the church so neatly repair'd too?Do not all praise our pavements? Our well-arranged cover'd-in conduits,Always well furnish'd with water, utility blending with safety,So that a fire, whenever it happens, is straightway extinguish'd,--Is not this the result of that conflagration so dreadful?Six times in Council I superintended the town's works, receivingHearty thanks and assistance from every well-disposed burgher.How I design'd, follow'd up, and ensured the completion of measuresWorthy men had projected, and afterwards left all unfinish'd!Finally, every man in the Council took pleasure in working.All put forth their exertions, and now they have finally settledThat new highway to make, which will join our town with the main road.But I am greatly afraid that the young generation won't act thus;Some on the one hand think only of pleasure and trumpery dresses,Others wont stir out of doors, and pass all their time by the fireside,And our Hermann, I fear, will always be one of this last sort."

　　Forthwith to him replied the excellent sensible mother"Father, you're always unjust whenever you speak of your son, andThat is the least likely way to obtain your wishes' fulfillment,For we cannot fashion our children after our fancy.We must have them and love them, as God has given them to us,Bring them up for the best, and let each do as he listeth.One has one kind of gift, another possesses another,Each one employs them, and each in turn in his separate fashionGood and happy becomes. My Hermann shall not be upbraided,For I know that he well deserves the wealth he'll inherit;He'll be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and peasants,And, as I clearly foresee, by no means the last in the Council.But with your blame and reproaches, you daily dishearten him sadly,As you have done just now, and make the poor fellow unhappy."

　　Then she left the apartment, and after her son hasten'd quickly,Hoping somewhere to find him, and with her words of affectionGladden his heart, for he, the excellent son, well deserved it.Smilingly, when she had closed the door, continued the father"What a wonderful race of people are women and children.All of them fain would do whatever pleases their fancy,And we're only alow'd to praise them and flatter them freely.Once for all there's truth in the ancient proverb which tells us:He who moves not forward, goes backward! a capital saying!"

　　Speaking with much circumspection, the druggist made answer as follows"What you say, good neighbour, is certainly true, and my plan isAlways to think of improvement, provided tho' new, 'tis not costly.But what avails it in truth, unless one has plenty of money,Active and fussy to he, improving both inside and outside?Sadly confined are the means of a burgher; e'en when he knows it,Little that's good he is able to do, his purse is too narrow,And the sum wanted too great; and so he is always prevented.I have had plenty of schemes! but then I was terribly frighten'dAt the expense, especially during a time of such danger.Long had my house smiled upon me, decked out in modish exterior,Long had my windows with large panes of glass resplendently glitterd.Who can compete with a merchant, however, who, rolling in riches,Also knows the manner in which what is best can be purchased?Only look at the house up yonder, the new one: how handsomeLooks the stucco of those white scrolls on the green-colour'd panels!Large are the plates of the windows--how shining and brilliant the panes are,Quite eclipsing the rest of the houses that stand in the market!Yet at the time of the fire, our two were by far the most handsome,Mine at the sign of the Angel, and yours at the old Golden Lion.Then my garden was famous throughout the whole country, and strangersUsed to stop as they pass'd and peep through my red-colourd palingsAt my beggars of stone, and at my dwarfs, which were painted,He to whom I gave coffee inside my beautiful grotto,Which, alas! is now cover'd with dust and tumbling to pieces,Used to rejoice in the colour'd glimmering light of the mussels,Ranged in natural order around it, and connoisseurs evenUsed with dazzled eyes to gaze at the spars and the coral.Then, in the drawing-room, people look'd with delight on the painting,Where the prim ladies and gentlemen walked in the garden demurely,And with pointed fingers presented the flowers, and held them.Ah, if only such things were now to be seen! Little care INow to go out; for everything needs to be alter'd and tasteful,As it is call'd; and white are the benches of wood and the palings;All things are simple and plain; and neither carving not gildingNow are employ'd, and foreign timber is now all the fashion.I should be only too pleased to possess some novelty also,So as to march with the times, and my household furniture alter.But we all are afraid to make the least alteration,For who is able to pay the present charges of workmen?Lately a fancy possess'd me, the angel Michael, whose figureHangs up over my shop, to treat to a new coat of gilding,And the terrible Dragon, who round his feet is entwining;But I have left him all brown; as he is; for the cost quite alarm'd me."-----IV. EUTERPE.

　　MOTHER AND SON.

　　THUS the men discoursed together; and meanwhile the motherWent in search of her son,--at first in front of the dwellingOn the bench of stone, for he was accustom'd to sit there.When she found him not there, she went to look in the stable,Thinking perchance he was feeding his splendid horses, the stallionsWhich he had bought when foals, and which he entrusted to no one.But the servant inform'd her that he had gone to the garden.Then she nimbly strode across the long double courtyard,Left the stables behind, and the barns all made of good timber,Enter'd the garden which stretch'd far away to the walls of the borough,Walk'd across it, rejoicing to see how all things were growing,Carefully straighten'd the props, on which the apple-tree's branches,Heavily loaded, reposed, and the weighty boughs of the pear-tree,Took a few caterpillars from off the strong-sprouting cabbage;For a bustling woman is never idle one moment.In this manner she came to the end of the long-reaching garden,Where was the arbour all cover'd with woodbine: she found not her son there,Nor was he to be seen in any part of the garden.But she found on the latch the door which out of the arbourThrough the wall of the town had been made by special permissionDuring their ancestor's time, the worthy old burgomaster.So she easily stepp'd across the dry ditch at the spot whereOn the highway abutted their well-inclosed excellent vineyard.Rising steeply upwards, its face tow'rd the sun turn'd directly.Up the hill she proceeded, rejoicing, as farther she mounted,At the size of the grapes, which scarcely were hid by the foliage.Shady and well-cover'd in, the middle walk at the top was,Which was ascended by steps of rough flat pieces constructed.And within it were hanging fine chasselas and muscatels also,And a reddish-blue grape, of quite an exceptional bigness,All with carefulness planted, to give to their guests after dinner.But with separate stems the rest of the vineyard was planted,Smaller grapes producing, from which the finest wine made is.So she constantly mounted, enjoying in prospect the autumn.And the festal day, when the neighbourhood met with rejoicing,Picking and treading the grapes, and putting the must in the wine-vats,Every corner and nook resounding at night with the fireworks,Blazing and cracking away, due honour to pay to the harvest.But she uneasy became, when she in vain had been callingTwice and three times her son, and when the sole answer that reach'd herCame from the garrulous echo which out of the town towers issued.Strange it appear'd to have to seek him; he never went far off,(As he before had told her) in order to ward off all sorrowFrom his dear mother, and her forebodings of coming disaster.But she still was expecting upon the highway to find him,For the doors at the bottom, like those at the top, of the vineyardStood wide open; and so at length she enter'd the broad fieldWhich, with its spreading expanse, o'er the whole of the hill's back extended.On their own property still she proceeded, greatly rejoicingAt their own crops, and at the corn which nodded so bravely,Over the whole field in golden majesty waving.Then on the border between the fields she follow'd the footpath,Keeping her eye on the pear-tree fix'd, the big one, which standingPerch'd by itself on the top of the hill, their property bounded.Who had planted it, no one knew; throughout the whole countryFar and wide was it visible; noted also its fruit was.Under its shadow the reaper ate his dinner at noonday,And the herdsman was wont to lie, when tending his cattle.Benches made of rough stones and of turf were placed all about it.And she was not mistaken; there sat her Hermann and restedOn his arm he was leaning, and seem'd to be looking cross countryTow'rds the mountains beyond; his back was turn'd to his mother.Softly creeping up, she lightly tapp'd on his shoulder;And he hastily turn'd; she saw that his eyes full of tears were.

　　"Mother," he said in confusion:--"You greatly surprise me!" and quicklyWiped he away his tears, the noble and sensitive youngster."What! You are weeping, my son?" the startled mother continued"That is indeed unlike you! I never before saw you crying!Say, what has sadden'd your heart? What drives you to sit here all lonelyUnder the shade of the pear-tree? What is it that makes you unhappy?"

　　Then the excellent youth collected himself, and made answer"Truly that man can have no heart, but a bosom of iron,Who no sympathy feels for the wants of unfortunate exiles;He has no sense in his head who, in times of such deep tribulation,Has no concern for himself or for his country's well-being.What I to-day have seen and heard, has stirr'd up my feelings;Well, I have come up here, and seen the beautiful, spreadingLandscape, which in fruitful hills to our sight is presented,Seen the golden fruit of the sheaves all nodding together,And a plentiful crop of fruit, full garners foreboding.But, alas, how near is the foe! By the Rhine's flowing watersWe are protected indeed; but what are rivers and mountainsTo such a terrible nation, which hurries along like a tempest!For they summon together the young and the old from all quarters,Rushing wildly along, while the multitude little is caringEven for death; when one falls, his place is straight fill'd by another,Ah! and can Germans dare to remain at home in their dwellings,Thinking perchance to escape from the widely-threat'ning disaster?Dearest mother, I tell you that I to-day am quite sorryThat I was lately excused, when they selected the fightersOut of the townfolk. 'Tis true I'm an only son, and more-overLarge is our inn, and our business also is very important;Were it not better however for me to fight in the vanguardOn the frontier, than here to await disaster and bondage?Yes, my spirit has told me, and in my innermost bosomFeel I courage and longing to live and die for my country,And to others to set an example worthy to follow.Oh, of a truth, if the strength of the German youths was collectedOn the frontier, all bound by a vow not to yield to the stranger,He on our noble soil should never set foot, or be ableUnder our eyes to consume the fruits of the land, or to issueOrders unto our men, or despoil our women and maidens!See, good mother, within my inmost heart I've determinedSoon and straightway to do what seems to me right and becoming;For the man who thinks long, not always chooses what best is.See, I will not return to the house, but will go from here straightwayInto the town, and there will place at the fighters' disposalThis stout arm and this heart, to serve, as I best can, my country.Then let my father say whether feelings of honour are stirringIn my bosom or not, and whether I yearn to mount upwards."

　　Then with significance answer'd his good and sensible mother,Shedding tears in silence, which easily rose in her eyelids:--"Son, what has wrought so strange a change in your temper and feelings,That you freely and openly speak to your mother no longer,As you till yesterday did, nor tell her truly your wishes?If another had heard you speaking, he doubtless would praise youHighly, and deem your new resolution as worthy of honour,Being deceived by your words, and by your manner of speaking.I however can only blame you. I know you much better.You are concealing your heart, and very diff'rent your thoughts are;For I am sure you care not at all for drum and for trumpet,Nor, to please the maidens, care you to wear regimentals.For, though brave you may be, and gallant, your proper vocationIs to remain at home, the property quietly watching.Therefore tell me truly: What means this sudden decision?"

　　Earnestly answer'd the son:--"You are wrong, dear-mother, one day isUnlike another. The youth soon ripens into his manhood.Ofttimes he ripens better to action in silence than livingThat tumultuous noisy life which ruins so many.And though silent I have been, and am, a heart has been fashion'dInside my bosom, which hates whatever unfair and unjust is,And I am able right well to discriminate secular matters.Work moreover my arms and my feet has mightily strengthen'd.All that I tell you is true; I boldly venture to say so.And yet, mother, you blame me with reason; you've caught me employingWords that are only half true, and that serve to conceal my true feelings.For I must need confess, it is not the advent of dangerCalls me away from my father's house, nor a resolute purposeUseful to be to my country, and dreaded to be by the foeman.Words alone it was that I utter'd,--words only intendedThose deep feelings to hide, which within my breast are contending.And now leave me, my mother! For as in my bosom I cherishWishes that are but vain, my life will be to no purpose.For I know that the Unit who makes a self-sacrifice, onlyInjures himself, unless all endeavour the Whole to accomplish."

　　"Now continue," replied forthwith his sensible mother:--"Tell me all that has happen'd, the least as w'ell as the greatestMen are always hasty, and only remember the last thing,And the hasty are easily forced from the road by obstructions.But a woman is skillful, and full of resources, and scorns notBye-roads to traverse when needed, well-skill'd to accomplish her purpose.Tell me then all, and why you are stirr'd by such violent feelingsMore than I ever have seen, while the blood is boiling within you,And from your eyes the tears against your will fain would fall now."

　　Then the youth gave way to his sorrow, and burst into weeping,Weeping aloud on the breast of his mother, and softly replying"Truly, my father's words to-day have wounded me sadly,Never have I deserved at his hands such treatment,--no, never!For to honour my parents was always my wish from my childhood,No one ever appear'd so prudent and wise as my parents,Who in the darker days of childhood carefully watch'd me.Much indeed it has been my lot to endure from my playmates,When with their knavish pranks they used to embitter my temper.Often I little suspected the tricks they were playing upon me:But if they happen'd to ridicule Father, whenever on SundaysOut of church he came with his slow deliberate footsteps,If they laugh'd at the strings of his cap, and his dressing-gown's flowers,Which he in stately wise wore, and to-day at length has discarded,Then in a fury I clench'd my fist, and, storming and raging,Fell upon them and hit and struck with terrible onslaught,Heedless where my blows fell. With bleeding noses they halloed,And could scarcely escape from the force of my blows and my kicking.Then, as in years I advanced, I had much to endure from my father,Who, in default of others to blame, would often abuse me,When at the Council's last sitting his anger perchance was excited,And I the penalty paid of the squabbles and strife of his colleagues.You yourself have oft pitied me; I endured it with patience,Always rememb'ring the much-to-be-honour'd kindness of parents,Whose only thought is to swell for our sakes their goods and possessions,And who deprive themselves of much, to save for their children.But, alas, not saving alone, for enjoyment hereafter,Constitutes happiness, no, not heaps of gold or of silver,Neither field upon field, however compact the estate be.For the father grows old, and his son at the same time grows older,Feeling no joy in To-day, and full of care for To-morrow.Now look down from this height, and see how beauteous before usLies the fair rich expanse, with vineyard and gardens at bottom;There are the stables and barns, and the rest of the property likewise;There I also descry the back of our house, in the gablesOf the roof may be seen the window of my small apartment.When I remember the time when I used to look out for the moon thereHalf through the night, or perchance at morning awaited the sunrise,When with but few hours of healthy sleep I was fully contented,Ah, how lonely do all things appear! My chamber, the court, andGarden, the beautiful field which spreads itself over the hillside;All appears but a desert to me: I still am unmarried!"Then his good mother answer'd his speech in a sensible manner"Son, your wish to be able to lead your bride to her chamber,Turning the night to the dearest and happiest half of your lifetime,Making your work by day more truly free and unfetter'd,Cannot be greater than that of your father and mother. We alwaysUrged you,--commanded, I even might say,--to choose some fair maiden.But I know full well, and my heart has told me alreadyIf the right hour arrives not, or if the right maiden appears notInstantly when they are sought for, man's choice is thrown in confusion,And he is driven by fear to seize what is counterfeit only.If I may tell you, my son, your choice already is taken,For your heart is smitten, and sensitive more than is usual.Answer me plainly, then, for my spirit already has told me:She whom now you have chosen is that poor emigrant maiden!"

　　"Yes, dear mother, you're right!" the son with vivacity answer'dYes, it is she! And unless this very day I conduct herHome as my bride, she will go on her way and escape me for ever,In the confusion of war, and in moving backwards and forwards.Mother, then before my eyes will in vain he unfoldedAll our rich estate, and each year henceforward be fruitful.Yes, the familiar house and the garden will be my aversion.Ah, and the love of my mother no comfort will give to my sorrow,For I feel that by Love each former bond must be loosen'd,When her own bonds she knits; 'tis not the maiden alone whoLeaves her father and mother behind, when she follows her husband.So it is with the youth; no more he knows mother and father.When he beholds the maiden, the only beloved one, approaching.Therefore let me go hence, to where desperation may lead me,For my father already has spoken in words of decision,And his house no longer is mine, if he shuts out the maidenWhom alone I would fain take home as my bride from henceforward."

　　Then the excellent sensible mother answer'd with quickness"Men are precisely like rocks when they stand opposed to each other!Proud and unyielding, the one will never draw near to the other.Neither will suffer his tongue to utter the first friendly accent.Therefore I tell you, my son, a hope still exists in my bosom,If she is worthy and good, he will give his consent to your marriage,Poor though she be, and although with disdain he refused you the poor thing.For in his hot-beaded fashion he utters many expressionsWhich he never intends; and so will accept the Refused One.But he requires kind words, and has a right to require them,For your father he is; his anger is all after dinner,When he more eagerly speaks, and questions the reasons of others,Meaning but little thereby; the wine then excites all the vigourOf his impetuous will, and prevents him from giving due weight toOther people's opinions; he hears and he feels his own only.But when evening arrives, the tone of the many discoursesWhich his friends and himself hold together, is very much alter'd.Milder becomes he, as soon as his liquor's effects have passed overAnd he feels the injustice his eagerness did unto others.Come, we will venture at once! Success the reward is of boldness,And we have need of the friends who now have assembled around him.--Most of all we shall want the help of our excellent pastor."Thus she eagerly spoke, and leaving the stone that she sat on,Also lifted her son from his seat. He willingly follow'd,And they descended in silence, revolving the weighty proposal.-----V. POLYHYMNIA.

　　THE COSMOPOLITE.

　　BUT the Three, as before, were still sitting and talking together,With the landlord, the worthy divine, and also the druggist,And the conversation still concern'd the same subject,Which in every form they had long been discussing together.Full of noble thoughts, the excellent pastor continued"I can't contradict you. I know 'tis the duty of mortalsEver to strive for improvement; and, as we may see, they strive alsoEver for that which is higher, at least what is new they seek after,But don't hurry too fast! For combined with these feelings, kind NatureAlso has given us pleasure in dwelling on that which is ancient,And in clinging to that to which we have long been accustom'd.Each situation is good that's accordant to nature and reason.Many things man desires, and yet he has need of but little;For but short are the days, and confined is the lot of a mortal.I can never blame the man who, active and restless,Hurries along, and explores each corner of earth and the oceanBoldly and carefully, while he rejoices at seeing the profitsWhich round him and his family gather themselves in abundance.But I also duly esteem the peaceable burgher,Who with silent steps his paternal inheritance paces,And watches over the earth, the seasons carefully noting.'Tis not every year that he finds his property alter'd;Newly-planted trees cannot stretch out their arms tow'rds the heavensAll in a moment, adorn'd with beautiful buds in abundance.No, a man has need of patience, he also has need ofPure unruffled tranquil thoughts and an intellect honest;For to the nourishing earth few seeds at a time he entrusteth,Few are the creatures he keeps at a time, with a view to their breeding,For what is Useful alone remains the first thought of his lifetime.Happy the man to whom Nature a mind thus attuned may have given!'Tis by him that we all are fed. And happy the townsmanOf the small town who unites the vocations of town and of country.He is exempt from the pressure by which the poor farmer is worried,Is not perplex'd by the citizens' cares and soaring ambition,Who, with limited means,--especially women and maidens,--Think of nothing but aping the ways of the great and the wealthy,You should therefore bless your son's disposition so peaceful,And the like-minded wife whom we soon may expect him to marry.

　　Thus he spoke. At that moment the mother and son stood before them.By the hand she led him and placed him in front of her husband"Father," she said, "how often have we, when talking together,Thought of that joyful day in the future, when Hermann, selectingAfter long waiting his bride at length would make us both happy!All kinds of projects we form'd. designing first one, then anotherGirl as his wife, as we talk'd in the manner that parents delight in.Now the day has arrived; and now has his bride been conductedHither and shown him by Heaven; his heart at length has decided.Were we not always saying that he should choose for himself, andWere you not lately wishing that he might feel for a maidenWarm and heart-felt emotions? And now has arrived the right moment!Yes, he has felt and has chosen, and like a man has decided.That fair maiden it is, the Stranger whom he encounter'd.Give her him; else he'll remain--he has sworn it--unmarried for ever."

　　And the son added himself:--"My father, O give her! My heart hasChosen purely and truly: she'll make you an excellent daughter."

　　But the father was silent. Then suddenly rose the good pastor,And address'd him as follows:--" One single moment's decisiveBoth of the life of a man, and of the whole of his Future.After lengthen'd reflection, each resolution made by himIs but the work of a moment; the prudent alone seize the right one.Nothing more dangerous is, in making a choice, than revolvingFirst this point and then that, and so confusing the feelings.Pure is Hermann's mind; from his youth I have known him; he never,Even in boyhood, was wont to extend his hand hither and thither.What he desired, was suitable to him; he held to it firmly.Be not astonish'd and scared, because there appears on a suddenWhat you so long have desired. 'Tis true the appearance at presentBears not the shape of the wish, as you in your mind had conceived it.For our wishes conceal the thing that we wish for; our gifts tooCome from above upon us, each clad in its own proper figure.Do not now mistake the maiden who has succeededFirst in touching the heart of your good wise son, whom you love so.Happy is he who is able to clasp the hand of his first love,And whose dearest wish is not doom'd to pine in his bosom!Yes, I can see by his face, already his fate is decided;True affection converts the youth to a man in a moment.He little changeable is; I fear me, if this you deny him,All the fairest years of his life will be changed into sorrow."

　　Then in prudent fashion the druggist, who long had been wantingHis opinion to give, rejoin'd in the following manner"This is Just a case when the middle course is the wisest!'Hasten slowly,' you know, was the motto of Caesar Augustus.I am always ready to be of use to my neighbours,And to turn to their profit what little wits I can boast of.Youth especially needs the guidance of those who are older.Let me then depart; I fain would prove her, that maiden,And will examine the people 'mongst whom she lives, and who know her.I am not soon deceived; I know how to rate their opinions."

　　Then forthwith replied the son, with eagerness speaking:--"Do so, neighbour, and go, make your inquiries. However,I should greatly prefer that our friend, the pastor, went with you;Two such excellent men are witnesses none can find fault with.O, my father! the maiden no vagabond is, I assure you,No mere adventurer, wand'ring about all over the country,And deceiving the inexperienced youths with her cunning;No! the harsh destiny link'd with this war, so destructive of all things,Which is destroying the world, and already has wholly uprootedMany a time-honour'd fabric, has driven the poor thing to exile.Are not brave men of noble birth now wand'ring in mis'ry?Princes are fleeing disguised, and monarchs in banishment living.Ah, and she also herself, the best of her sisters, is drivenOut of her native land; but her own misfortunes forgetting,Others she seeks to console, and, though helpless, is also most helpful.Great are the woes and distress which over the earth's face are brooding,But may happiness not be evoked from out of this sorrow?May not I, in the arms of my bride, the wife I have chosen,Even rejoice at the war, as you at the great conflagration?"

　　Then replied the father, and open'd his mouth with importance:--"Strangely indeed, my son, has your tongue been suddenly loosen'd,Which for years has stuck in your mouth, and moved there but rarelyI to-day must experience that which threatens each father:How the ardent will of a son a too-gentle motherWillingly favours, whilst each neighbour is ready to back him,Only provided it be at the cost of a father or husband!But what use would it be to resist so many together?For I see that defiance and tears will otherwise greet me.Go and prove her, and in God's name then hasten to bring herHome as my daughter; if not, he must think no more of the maiden."

　　Thus spake the father. The son exclaim'd with jubilant gesture"Ere the ev'ning arrives, you shall have the dearest of daughters,Such as the man desires whose bosom is govern'd by prudenceAnd I venture to think the good creature is fortunate also.Yes, she will ever be grateful that I her father and motherHave restored her in you, as sensible children would wish it.But I will loiter no longer; I'll straightway harness the horses,And conduct our friends on the traces of her whom I love so,Leave the men to themselves and their own intuitive wisdom,And be guided alone by their decision--I swear it,--And not see the maiden again, until she my own is."Then he left the house; meanwhile the others were eagerlySettling many a point, and the weighty matter debating.

　　Hermann sped to the stable forthwith, where the spirited stallionsTranquilly stood and with eagerness swallow'd the pure oats before them,And the well-dried hay, which was cut from the best of their meadows.Then in eager haste in their mouths the shining bits placed he,Quickly drew the harness through the well-plated buckles,And then fastend the long broad reins in proper position,Led the horses out in the yard, where already the carriage,Easily moved along by its pole, had been push'd by the servant.Then they restrain'd the impetuous strength of the fast-moving horses,Fastening both with neat-looking ropes to the bar of the carriage.Hermann seized his whip, took his seat, and drove to the gateway.When in the roomy carriage his friends had taken their places,Swiftly he drove away, and left the pavement behind them,Left behind the walls of the town and the clean-looking towers,Thus sped Hermann along, till he reach'd the familiar highway,Not delaying a moment, and galloping uphill and downhill.When however at length the village steeple descried he,And not far away lay the houses surrounded by gardens,He began to think it was time to hold in the horses.

　　By the time-honour'd gloom of noble lime-trees o'er shadow'd,Which for many a century past on the spot had been rooted,Stood there a green and spreading grass-plot in front of the village,Cover'd with turf, for the peasants and neighbouring townsmen a playground.Scooped out under the trees, to no great depth, stood a fountain.On descending the steps, some benches of stone might be seen there,Ranged all around the spring, which ceaselessly well'd forth its waters,Cleanly, enclosed by a low wall all round, and convenient to draw from.Hermann then determined beneath the shadow his horsesWith the carriage to stop. He did so, and spoke then as follows"Now, my friends, get down, and go by yourselves to discoverWhether the maiden is worthy to have the hand which I offer.I am convinced that she is; and you'll bring me no new or strange story:Had I to manage alone, I would straightway go off to the village,And in few words should my fate by the charming creature be settled.

　　Her you will easily recognize 'mongst all the rest of the people,For her appearance is altogether unlike that of others.But I will now describe the modest dress she is wearing:--First a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting closely around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling.Free and joyously rises her head with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twistedHer blue well-plaited gown begins from under her bodice.And as she walks envelopes her well-turn'd ankles completely.But I have one thing to say, and this must expressly entreat you:Do not speak to the maiden, and let not your scheme be discover'd.But inquire of others, and hearken to all that they tell you,When you have learnt enough to satisfy father and mother,Then return to me straight, and we'll settle future proceedings.This is the plan which I have matured, while driving you hither."

　　Thus he spoke, and the friends forthwith went on to the village,Where, in gardens and barns and houses, the multitude crowded;All along the broad road the numberless carts were collected,Men were feeding the lowing cattle and feeding the horses.Women on every hedge the linen were carefully drying,Whilst the children in glee were splashing about in the streamlet.Forcing their way through the waggons, and past the men and the cattle,Walk'd the ambassador spies, looking well to the righthand and lefthand,Hoping somewhere to see the form of the well-described maiden;But wherever they look'd, no trace of the girl they discover'd.

　　Presently denser became the crowd. Round some of the waggons.Men in a passion were quarrelling, women also were screaming.Then of a sudden approach'd an aged man with firm footstepMarching straight up to the fighters; and forthwith was hush'd the contention,When he bade them be still, and with fatherly earnestness threaten'd."Are we not yet," he exclaim'd, "by misfortune so knitted together,As to have learnt at length the art of reciprocal patienceAnd toleration, though each cannot measure the actions of others?Prosperous men indeed may quarrel! Will sorrow not teach youHow no longer as formerly you should quarrel with brethren?Each should give way to each other, when treading the soil of the stranger,And, as you hope for mercy yourselves, you should share your possessions."

　　Thus the man address'd them, and all were silent. In peacefulHumour the reconciled men look'd after their cattle and waggons.When the pastor heard the man discourse in this fashion,And the foreign magistrate's peaceful nature discovered,He approach'd him in turn, and used this significant language"Truly, Father, when nations are living in days of good fortune,Drawing their food from the earth, which gladly opens its treasures,And its wish'd-for gifts each year and each month is renewing,Then all matters go smoothly; each thinks himself far the wisest,And the best, and so they exist by the side of each other,And the most sensible man no better than others is reckon'dFor the world moves on, as if by itself and in silence.But when distress unsettles our usual manner of living,Pulls down each time-honour'd fabric, and roots up the seed in our gardens,Drives the man and his wife far away from the home they delight in,Hurries them off in confusion through days and nights full of anguish,Ah! then look we around in search of the man who is wisest,And no longer in vain he utters his words full of wisdom.Tell me whether you be these fugitives' magistrate, Father,Over whose minds you appear to possess such an influence soothing?Aye, to-day I could deem you one of the leaders of old time,Who through wastes and through deserts conducted the wandering people;I could imagine 'twas Joshua I am addressing, or Moses."

　　Then with solemn looks the magistrate answer'd as follows"Truly the present times resemble the strangest of old times,Which are preserved in the pages of history, sacred or common.He in these days who has lived to-day and yesterday only,Many a year has lived, events so crowd on each other.When I reflect back a little, a grey old age I could fancyOn my head to be lying, and yet my strength is still active.Yes, we people in truth may liken ourselves to those othersUnto whom in a fiery bush appear'd, in a solemnMoment, the Lord our God; in fire and clouds we behold him."

　　When the pastor would fain continue to speak on this subject,And was anxious to learn the fate of the man and his party,Quickly into his ear his companion secretly whisper'd"Speak for a time with the magistrate, turning your talk on the maiden,Whilst I wander about, endeav'ring to find her. DirectlyI am successful, I'll join you again." Then nodded the pastor,And the spy went to seek her, in barns and through hedges and gardens.-----VI. KLIO.

　　THE AGE.

　　WHEN the pastor ask'd the foreign magistrate questions,What the people had suffer'd, how long from their homes they had wander'd,Then the man replied:--"By no means short are our sorrows,For we have drunk the bitters of many a long year together,All the more dreadful, because our fairest hopes have been blighted.Who can deny that his heart beat wildly and high in his bosomAnd that with purer pulses his breast more freely was throbbing,When the newborn sun first rose in the whole of its glory,When we heard of the right of man, to have all things in common,Heard of noble Equality, and of inspiriting Freedom!Each man then hoped to attain new life for himself, and the fettersWhich had encircled many a land appear'd to be broken,Fetters held by the hands of sloth and selfish indulgence.Did not all nations turn their gaze, in those days of emotion,Tow'rds the world's capital, which so many a long year had been so,And then more than ever deserved a name so distinguish'd?Were not the men, who first proclaim'd so noble a message,Names that are worthy to rank with the highest the sun ever shone on,Did not each give to mankind his courage and genius and language?

　　"And we also, as neighbours, at first were warmly excited.Presently after began the war, and the train of arm'd FrenchmenNearer approach'd; at first they appear'd to bring with them friendship,And they brought it in fact; for all their souls were exalted.And the gay trees of liberty ev'rywhere gladly they planted,Promising unto each his own, and the government long'd for.Greatly at this was youth, and greatly old age was delighted,And the joyous dance began round the newly-raised standards.In this manner the overpowering Frenchmen soon conquer'dFirst the minds of the men, with their fiery lively proceedings,Then the hearts of the women, with irresistible graces.Even the strain of the war, with its many demands, seem'd but trifling,For before our eyes the distance by hope was illumined,Luring our gaze far ahead into paths now first open'd before us."O how joyful the time, when with his bride the glad bridegroomWhirls in the dance, awaiting the day that will join them for everBut more glorious far was the time when the Highest of all thingsWhich man's mind can conceive, close by and attainable seemed.Then were the tongues of all loosen'd, and words of wisdom and feelingNot by greybeards alone, but by men and by striplings were utter'd.

　　"But the heavens soon clouded became. For the sake of the mast'ryStrove a contemptible crew, unfit to accomplish good actions.Then they murder'd each other, and took to oppressing their new-foundNeighbours and brothers, and sent on missions whole herds of selfseekersAnd the superiors took to carousing and robbing by wholesale,And the inferiors down to the lowest caroused and robb'd also.Nobody thought of aught else than having enough for tomorrow.Terrible was the distress, and daily increased the oppression.None the cry understood, that they of the day were the masters.Then even temperate minds were attack'd by sorrow and fury;Each one reflected, and swore to avenge all the injuries suffer'd,And to atone for the hitter loss of hopes twice defrauded.Presently Fortune declared herself on the side of the Germans,And the French were compell'd to retreat by forced marches before them.Ah! the sad fate of the war we then for the first time experienced.For the victor is kind and humane, at least he appears so,And he spares the man he has vanquish'd, as if he his own were,When he employs him daily, and with his property helps him.But the fugitive knows no law; he wards off death only,And both quickly and recklessly all that he meets with, consumes he.Then his mind becomes heated apace; and soon desperationFills his heart, and impels him to all kinds of criminal actions.Nothing then holds he respected, he steals It. With furious longingOn the woman he rushes; his lust becomes awful to think of.Death all around him he sees, his last minutes in cruelty spends he,Wildly exulting in blood, and exulting in howls and in anguish.

　　"Then in the minds of our men arose a terrible yearningThat which was lost to avenge, and that which remain'd to defend still.All of them seized upon arms, lured on by the fugitives' hurry,By their pale faces, and by their shy, uncertain demeanour.There was heard the sound of alarm-bells unceasingly ringing,And the approach of danger restrain'd not their violent fury.Soon into weapons were turn'd the implements peaceful of tillage,And with dripping blood the scythe and the pitchfork were cover'd.Every foeman without distinction was ruthlessly slaughter'd,Fury was ev'rywhere raging, and artful, cowardly weakness.May I never again see men in such wretched confusion!Even the raging wild beast is a better object to gaze on.Ne'er let them speak of freedom, as if themselves they could govern!All the evil which Law has driven farback in the cornerSeems to escape, as soon as the fetters which bound it are loosen'd."

　　"Excellent man," replied the pastor, with emphasis speaking"If you're mistaken in man, 'tis not for me to reprove you.Evil enough have you suffer'd indeed from his cruel proceedings!Would you but look back, however, on days so laden with sorrow,You would yourself confess how much that is good you have witness'd,Much that is excellent, which remains conceald in the bossomTill by danger 'tis stirr'd, and till necessity makes manShow himself as an angel, a tutelar God unto others."

　　Then with a smile replied the worthy old magistrate, saying"Your reminder is wise, like that which they give to the suff'rerWho has had his dwelling burnt down, that under the ruins,Gold and silver are lying, though melted and cover'd with ashes.Little, indeed, it may be, and yet that little is precious,And the poor man digs it up, and rejoices at finding the treasure.Gladly, therefore, I turn my thoughts to those few worthy actionsWhich my memory still is able to dwell on with pleasure.Yes, I will not deny it, I saw late foemen unitingSo as to save the town from harm; I saw with devotionParents, children and friends impossible actions attempting,Saw how the youth of a sudden became a man, how the greybeardOnce more was young, how the child as a stripling appear'd in a moment.Aye, and the weaker sex, as people commonly call it,Show'd itself brave and daring, with presence of mind all-unwonted.Let me now, in the first place, describe a deed of rare meritBy a high-spirited girl accomplish'd, an excellent maiden,Who in the great farmhouse remain'd behind with the servants,When the whole of the men had departed, to fight with the strangers.Well, there fell on the court a troop of vagabond scoundrels,Plund'ring and forcing their way inside the rooms of the women.Soon they cast their eyes on the forms of the grown-up fair maidenAnd of the other dear girls, in age little more than mere children.Hurried away by raging desire, unfeelingly rush'd theyOn the trembling band, and on the high-spirited maiden.But she instantly seized the sword from the side of a ruffian,Hew'd him down to the ground; at her feet straight fell he, all bleeding,Then with doughty strokes the maidens she bravely deliver'd.Wounded four more of the robbers; with life, however, escaped they.Then she lock'd up the court, and, arm'd still, waited for succour.

　　When the pastor heard the praise of the maiden thus utter'dFeelings of hope for his friend forthwith arose in his bosom,And he prepared to ask what had been the fate of the damsel,Whether she, in the sorrowful flight, form'd one of the people?At this moment, however, the druggist nimbly approach'd them,Pull'd the sleeve of the pastor, and whisper'd to him as follows"I have at last pick'd out the maiden from many a hundredBy her description! Pray come and judge for yourself with your own eyes;Bring the magistrate with you, that we may learn the whole story."

　　So they turn'd themselves round; but the magistrate found himself summon'dBy his own followers, who had need of his presence and counsel.But the pastor forthwith the druggist accompanied, till theyCame to a gap in the hedge, when the latter pointed with slyness,"See you," exclaim'd he, "the maiden? The child's clothes she has been changing.And I recognise well the old calico--also the cushion--Cover of blue, which Hermann took in the bundle and gave her.Quickly and well, of a truth, she has used the presents left with her.These are evident proofs; and all the rest coincide too;For a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting close around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which, with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling;Free and joyously rises her head, with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twisted.When she is sitting, we plainly see her noble proportions,And the blue well-plaited gown which begins from close to her bosom,And in rich folds descending, her well-turn'd ankles envelops.'Tis she, beyond all doubt. So come, that we may examineWhether she be both a good and a frugal and virtuous maiden."Then the pastor rejoin'd, the sitting damsel inspecting"That she enchanted the youth, I confess is no matter of wonder,For she stands the test of the gaze of a man of experience.Happy the person to whom Mother Nature the right face has given!She recommends him at all times, he never appears as a stranger,Each one gladly approaches, and each one beside him would linger,If with his face is combined a pleasant and courteous demeanour.Yes, I assure you the youth has indeed discover'd a maidenWho the whole of the days of his life will enliven with gladness,And with her womanly strength assist him at all times and truly.Thus a perfect body preserves the soul also in pureness,And a vigorous youth of a happy old age gives assurance.

　　After reflecting a little, the druggist made answer as follows:--"Yet appearances oft are deceitful. I trust not the outside.Often, indeed, have I found the truth of the proverb which tells usEre you share a bushel of salt with a new-found acquaintance,Do not trust him too readily; time will make you more certainHow you and he will get on, and whether your friendship is lasting.Let us then, in the first place, inquire amongst the good peopleUnto whom the maiden is known, who can tell us about her."

　　"Well, of a truth I commend your prudence," the pastor continued"Not for ourselves are we wooing! To woo for others is serious."So they started to meet the worthy magistrate seeingHow in the course of his business he was ascending the main street.And the wise pastor straightway address'd him with foresight as follows"We, by-the-bye, have just seen a girl in the neighbouring gardenUnder an apple-tree sitting, and clothes for the children preparing,Made of worn calico, which for the purpose was doubtless presented.We were pleased by her face; she appears to be one of the right sort.Tell us, what know you about her? We ask from a laudable motive."

　　When the magistrate came to the garden and peep'd in, exclaimed he"Well do I know her, in truth; for when I told you the storyOf that noble deed which was done by the maiden I spoke of,How she seized on the sword, and defended herself, and the servants,She the heroine was! You can see how active her nature.But she's as good as she's strong; for her aged kinsman she tendedUntil the time of his death, for he died overwhelm'd by afflictionAt the distress of his town, and the danger his goods were exposed to.Also with mute resignation she bore the grievous afflictionOf her betroth'd's sad death, a noble young man who, incitedBy the first fire of noble thoughts to struggle for freedom,Went himself to Paris, and soon found a terrible death there.For, as at home, so there, he fought 'gainst intrigue and oppression."

　　Thus the magistrate spoke. The others departed and thanked him,And the pastor produced a gold piece (the silver his purse heldHe some hours before had with genuine kindness expendedWhen he saw the fugitives passing in sorrowful masses).

　　And to the magistrate handed it, saying:--" Divide it, I pray you,'Mongst those who need it the most. May God give it prosperous increase."

　　But the man refused to accept it, and said:--"I assure you,Many a dollar we've saved, and plenty of clothing and such things,And I trust we may reach our homes before they are finish'd."

　　Then continued the pastor, the gold in his hand once more placing"None should delay to give in days like the present, and no oneOught to refuse to receive what is offer'd with liberal kindness.No one can tell how long he will keep what in peace he possesses,No one, how long he is doom'd in foreign countries to wander,While he's deprived of the field and the garden by which he is nurtured."

　　"Bravo!" added in turn the druggist, with eagerness speaking"Had I but money to spare in my pocket, you surely should have it,Silver and gold alike; for your followers certainly need it.Yet I'll not leave you without a present, if only to show youMy good will, and I hope you will take the will for the action."Thus he spoke, and pull'd out by the strings the leather embroider'dPouch, in which he was wont his stock of tobacco to carry,Daintily open'd and shared its contents--some two or three pipes' full."Small in truth is the gift," he added. The magistrate answered:"Good tobacco is always a welcome present to trav'llers."Then the druggist began his canister to praise very highly.But the pastor drew him away, and the magistrate left them."Come, let us hasten!" exclaimed the sensible man, "for our young friendAnxiously waits; without further delay let him hear the good tidings."

　　So they hasten'd and came, and found that the youngster was leaning'Gainst his carriage under the lime-trees. The horses were pawingWildly the turf; he held them in check and stood there all pensive,Silently gazing in front, and saw not his friends coming near him,Till, as they came, they called him and gave him signals of triumph.Some way off the druggist already began to address him,But they approach'd the youth still nearer, and then the good pastorSeized his hand and spoke and took the word from his comrade"Friend, I wish you joy! Your eye so true and your true heartRightly have chosen! May you and the wife of your young days be happy!She is full worthy of you; so come and turn around the carriage,That we may reach without delay the end of the village,So as to woo her, and shortly escort the dear creature home with us."But the youth stood still, and without any token of pleasureHeard the words of the envoy, though sounding consoling and heav'nly,Deeply sigh'd and said:--"We came full speed in the carriageAnd shall probably go back home ashamed and but slowly;For, since I have been waiting care has fallen upon me,Doubt and suspicion and all that a heart full of love is exposed to.Do you suppose we have only to come, for the maiden to follow,Just because we are rich, and she poor and wandering in exile?Poverty, when undeserved, itself makes proud. The fair maidenSeems to be active and frugal; the world she may claim as her portion.Do you suppose that a woman of such great beauty and mannersCan have grown up without exciting love in man's bosom?Do you suppose that her heart until now has to love been fast closed?Do not drive thither in haste, for perchance to our shame and confusionWe shall have slowly to turn towards home the heads of our horses.Yes, some youth, I fear me, possesses her heart, and alreadyShe has doubtless promised her hand and her solemn troth plighted,And I shall stand all ashamed before her, When making my offer."

　　Then the pastor proceeded to cheer him with words of good comfort,But his companion broke in, in his usual talkative manner"As things used to be, this embarrassment would not have happened,When each matter was brought to a close in an orthodox fashion.Then for their son themselves the bride the parents selected,And a friend of the house was secretly call'd in the first place.He was then quietly sent as a suitor to visit the parentsOf the selected bride; and, dress'd in his gayest apparel,Went after dinner some Sunday to visit the excellent burgher,And began by exchanging polite remarks on all subjects,Cleverly turning and bending the talk in the proper direction.After long beating about the bush, he flatter'd the daughter,And spoke well of the man and the house that gave his commission.Sensible people soon saw his drift, and the sensible envoyWatch'd how the notion was taken, and then could explain himself farther.If they declined the proposal, why then the refusal cost nothing,But if all prosper'd, why then the suitor for ever thereafterPlay'd the first fiddle at every family feast and rejoicing.For the married couple remember'd the whole of their lifetimeWhose was the skilful hand by which the marriage knot tied was.All this now is chang'd, and with many an excellent customHas gone quite out of fashion. Each person woos for himself now.Everyone now must bear the weight of a maiden's refusalOn his own shoulders, and stand all ashamed before her, if needs be."

　　"Let that be as it may," then answered the young man who scarcelyHeard what was said, and his mind had made up already in silence"I will go myself, and out of the mouth of the maidenLearn my own fate, for towards her I cherish the most trustful feelingsThat any man ever cherish'd towards any woman whatever.That which she says will be good and sensible,--this I am sure of.If I am never to see her again, I must once more behold her,And the ingenuous gaze of her black eyes must meet for the last time.If to my heart I may clasp her never, her bosom and shouldersI would once more see, which my arm so longs to encircle:Once more the mouth I would see, from which one kiss and a Yes willMake me happy for ever, a No for ever undo me.But now leave me alone! Wait here no longer. Return youStraight to my father and mother, in order to tell them in personThat their son was right, and that the maiden is worthy.And so leave me alone! I myself shall return by the footpathOver the hill by the pear-tree and then descend through the vineyard,Which is the shortest way back. Oh may I soon with rejoicingTake the beloved one home! But perchance all alone I must slink backBy that path to our house and tread it no more with a light heart."Thus he spoke, and then placed the reins in the hands of the pastor,Who, in a knowing way both the foaming horses restraining,Nimbly mounted the carriage, and took the seat of the driver.

　　But you still delay'd, good cautious neighbour, and spoke thusFriend, I will gladly entrust to you soul, and spirit, and mind too,But my body and bones are not preserved in the best wayWhen the hand of a parson such worldly matters as reins grasps!"

　　But you smiled in return, you sensible pastor, replying"Pray jump in, nor fear with both body and spirit to trust me,For this hand to hold the reins has long been accustom'd,And these eyes are train'd to turn the corner with prudence.For we were wont to drive the carriage, when living at Strasburg,At the time when with the young baron I went there, for daily,Driven by me, through the echoing gateway thunder'd the carriageBy the dusty roads to distant meadows and lindens,Through the crowds of the people who spend their lifetime in walking."

　　Partially comforted, then his neighbour mounted the carriage,Sitting like one prepared to make a wise jump, if needs be,And the stallions, eager to reach their stables, coursed homewards,While beneath their powerful hoofs the dust rose in thick clouds.Long there stood the youth, and saw the dust rise before him,Saw the dust disperse; but still he stood there, unthinking.-----VII. ERATO.

　　DOROTHEA.

　　As the man on a journey, who, just at the moment of sunset,Fixes his gaze once more on the rapidly vanishing planet,Then on the side of the rocks and in the dark thicket still sees heHov'ring its image; wherever he turns his looks, on in front stillRuns it, and glitters and wavers before him in colours all splendid,So before Hermanns eyes did the beautiful form of the maidenSoftly move, and appear'd to follow the path through the cornfields.

　　But he roused himself up from his startling dream, and then slowlyTurn'd tow'rd the village his steps, and once more started,--for once moreSaw he the noble maiden's stately figure approaching.Fixedly gazed he; it was no phantom in truth; she herself 'twasIn her hands by the handle she carried two pitchers,--one larger,One of a smaller size, and nimbly walk'd to the fountain.And he joyfully went to meet her; the sight of her gave himCourage and strength, and so he address'd the surprised one as follows:--"Do I find you again, brave maiden, engaged in assistingOthers so soon, and in giving refreshment to those who may need it?Tell me why you have come all alone to the spring so far distant,Whilst the rest are content with the water that's found in the village?This one, indeed, special virtue possesses, and pleasant to drink is.Is't for the sake of that sick one you come, whom you saved with such courage?"

　　Then the good maiden the youth in friendly fashion saluted,Saying:--"Already my walk to the fountain is fully rewarded,Since I have found the kind person who gave us so many good presents;For the sight of a giver, like that of a gift, is refreshing.Come and see for yourself the persons who tasted your kindness,And receive the tranquil thanks of all you have aided.But that you may know the reason why I have come here,Water to draw at a spot where the spring is both pure and unceasing,I must inform you that thoughtless men have disturb'd all the waterFound in the village, by carelessly letting the horses and oxenWade about in the spring which give the inhabitants water.In the same manner, with all their washing and cleaning they've dirtiedAll the troughs of the village, and all the fountains have sullied.For each one of them only thinks how quickly and soon heMay supply his own wants, and cares not for those who come after."

　　Thus she spoke, and soon she arrived at the foot of the broad stepsWith her companion, and both of them sat themselves down on the low wallRound the spring. She bent herself over, to draw out the water,He the other pitcher took up, and bent himself over,And in the blue of the heavens they saw their figures reflected,Waving, and nodding, and in the mirror their greetings exchanging."Now let me drink," exclaim'd the youth in accents of gladness.And she gave him the pitcher. They then, like old friends, sat together,Leaning against the vessels, when she address'd him as follows"Say, why find I you here without your carriage and horses,Far from the place where first I saw you. Pray how came you hither?"

　　Hermann thoughtfully gazed on the ground, but presently liftedCalmly towards her his glances, and gazed on her face in kind fashion,Feeling quite calm and composed. And yet with love to address herFound he quite out of the question; for love from her eyes was not beaming,But an intellect clear, which bade him use sensible language.Soon he collected his thoughts, and quietly said to the maiden:--"Let me speak, my child, and let me answer your questions."'Tis for your sake alone I have come,--why seek to conceal it?For I happily live with two affectionate parents,Whom I faithfully help to look after our house and possessions,Being an only son, while numerous are our employments.I look after the field work; the house is carefully managedBy my father; my mother the hostelry cheers and enlivens.But you also have doubtless found out how greatly the servants,Sometimes by fraud, and sometimes by levity, worry their mistress,Constantly making her change them, and barter one fault for another.Long has my mother, therefore, been wanting a girl in the household,Who, not only with hand, but also with heart might assist her,In the place of the daughter she lost, alas, prematurely.Now when I saw you to-day near the carriage, so active and sprightly,Saw the strength of your arm and the perfect health of your members,When I heard your sensible words, I was struck with amazement,And I hasten'd back home, deservedly praising the strangerBoth to my parents and friends. And now I come to inform youWhat they desire, as I do. Forgive my stammering language!"

　　"Do not hesitate," said she, "to tell me the rest of your storyI have with gratitude felt that you have not sought to insult me.Speak on boldly, I pray; your words shall never alarm me;You would fain hire me now as maid to your father and mother,To look after the house, which now is in excellent order.And you think that in me you have found a qualified maiden,One that is able to work, and not of a quarrelsome nature.Your proposal was short, and short shall my answer be alsoYes! with you I will go, and the voice of my destiny follow.I have fulfill'd my duty, and brought the lying-in womanBack to her friends again, who all rejoice at her rescue.Most of them now are together, the rest will presently join them.All expect that they, in a few short days, will be ableHomewards to go; 'tis thus that exiles themselves love to flatter.But I cannot deceive myself with hopes so delusiveIn these sad days which promise still sadder days in the futureFor all the bonds of the world are loosen'd, and nought can rejoin them,Save that supreme necessity over our future impending.If in the house of so worthy a man I can earn my own living,Serving under the eye of his excellent wife, I will do so;For a wandering girl bears not the best reputation.Yes! with you I will go, as soon as I've taken the pitcherBack to my friends, and received the blessing of those worthy people.Come! you needs must see them, and from their hands shall receive me."

　　Joyfully heard the youth the willing maiden's decision,Doubting whether he now had not better tell her the whole truth;But it appear'd to him best to let her remain in her error,First to take her home, and then for her love to entreat her.Ah! but now he espied a golden ring on her finger,And so let her speak, while he attentively listen'd:--

　　"Let us now return," she continued, "the custom is alwaysTo admonish the maidens who tarry too long at the fountain,Yet how delightful it is by the fast-flowing water to chatter!"Then they both arose, and once more directed their glancesInto the fountain, and then a blissful longing came o'er them.

　　So from the ground by the handles she silently lifted the pitchers,Mounted the steps of the well, and Hermann follow'd the loved one.One of the pitchers he ask'd her to give him, thus sharing the burden."Leave it," she said, "the weight feels less when thus they are balanced;And the master I've soon to obey, should not be my servant.Gaze not so earnestly at me, as if my fate were still doubtfull!Women should learn betimes to serve, according to station,For by serving alone she attains at last to the mast'ry,To the due influence which she ought to possess in the household.Early the sister must learn to serve her brothers and parents,And her life is ever a ceaseless going and coming,Or a lifting and carrying, working and doing for others.Well for her, if she finds no manner of life too offensive,And if to her the hours of night and of day all the same are,So that her work never seems too mean, her needle too pointed,So that herself she forgets, and liveth only for others!For as a mother in truth she needs the whole of the virtues,When the suckling awakens the sick one, and nourishment calls forFrom the exhausted parent, heaping cares upon suff'ring.Twenty men together could not endure such a burden,And they ought not,--and yet they gratefully ought to behold it."

　　Thus she spoke, and with her silent companion advanced sheThrough the garden, until the floor of the granary reach'd they,Where the sick woman lay, whom she left by her daughters attended,Those dear rescued maidens, the types of innocent beauty.Both of them enter'd the room, and from the other direction,Holding a child in each hand, her friend, the magistrate, enter'd.These had lately been lost for some time by the sorrowing mother,But the old man had now found them out in the crowd of the people.And they sprang in with joy, to greet their dearly-loved mother,To rejoice in a brother, the playmate now seen for the first time!

　　Then on Dorothea they sprang, and greeted her warmly,Asking for bread and fruit, but asking for drink before all things.And they handed the water all round. The children first drank some,Then the sick woman drank, with her daughters, the magistrate also.All were refresh'd, and sounded the praise of the excellent water;Mineral was it, and very reviving, and wholesome for drinking.

　　Then with a serious look continued the maiden, and spoke thusFriends, to your mouths for the last time in truth I have lifted the pitcher,And for the last time, alas, have moisten'd your lips with pure water.But whenever in scorching heat your drink may refresh you,And in the shade you enjoy repose and a fountain unsullied,Then remember me, and all my friendly assistance,Which I from love, and not from relationship merely have render'd.All your kindness to me, as long as life lasts, I'll remember,I unwillingly leave you; but each one is now to each otherRather a burden than comfort. We all must shortly be scatter'dOver a foreign land, unless to return we are able.See, here stands the youth to whom for those gifts we're indebted,All those clothes for the child, and all those acceptable viands.Well, he has come, and is anxious that I to his house should go with him,There as a servant to act to his rich and excellent parents,And I have not refused him, for serving appears my vocation,And to be served by others at home would seem like a burden.So I'll go willingly with him; the youth appears to be prudent,Thus will his parents be properly cared for, as rich people should be.Therefore, now, farewell, my much-loved friend, and be joyfulIn your living infant, who looks so healthily at you.When you press him against your bosom, wrapp'd up in those colourdSwaddling-clothes, then remember the youth who so kindly bestow'd them,And who in future will feed and clothe me also, your loved friend.You too, excellent man," to the magistrate turning, she added"Warmly I thank for so often acting the part of a father."

　　Then she knelt herself down before the lying-in patient,Kiss'd the weeping woman, her whisper'd blessing receiving.Meanwhile the worthy magistrate spoke to Hermann as follows"You deserve, my friend to be counted amongst the good landlordsWho are anxious to manage their house through qualified people.For I have often observed how cautiously men are accustom'dSheep and cattle and horses to watch, when buying or bart'ringBut a man, who's so useful, provided he's good and efficient,And who does so much harm and mischief by treacherous dealings,Him will people admit to their houses by chance and haphazard,And too late find reason to rue an o'erhasty decision.This you appear to understand, for a girl you have chosenAs your servant, and that of your parents, who thoroughly good is.Treat her well, and as long as she finds the business suit her,You will not miss your sister, your parents will miss not their daughter."

　　Other persons now enter'd, the patient's nearest relations,Many articles bringing, and better lodgings announcing.All were inform'd of the maiden's decision, and warmly bless'd Hermann,Both with significant looks, and also with grateful expressions,And one secretly whispered into the ear of another"If the master should turn to a bridegroom, her home is provided."Hermann then presently took her hand, and address'd her as follows"Let us be going; the day is declining, and far off the village."Then the women, with lively expressions, embraced Dorothea;Hermann drew her away; they still continued to greet her.Next the children, with screams and terrible crying attack'd her,Pulling her clothes, their second mother refusing to part from.But first one of the women, and then another rebuked them"Children, hush! to the town she is going, intending to bring youPlenty of gingerbread back, which your brother already had order'd,From the confectioner, when the stork was passing there lately,And she'll soon return, with papers prettily gilded."

　　So at length the children released her; but scarcely could HermannTear her from their embraces and distant-signalling kerchiefs.-----VIII. MELPOMENE.

　　HERMANN AND DOROTHEA.

　　So tow'rd the sun, now fast sinking to rest, the two walk'd together,Whilst he veil'd himself deep in clouds which thunder portended.Out-of his veil now here, now there, with fiery glancesBeaming over the plain with rays foreboding and lurid."May this threatening weather," said Hermann, "not bring to us shortlyHail and violent rain, for well does the harvest now promise."And they both rejoiced in the corn so lofty and waving,Well nigh reaching the heads of the two tall figures that walk'd there.Then the maiden spoke to her friendly leader as follows"Generous youth, to whom I shall owe a kind destiny shortly,Shelter and home, when so many poor exiles must weather the tempest,In the first place tell me all about your good parents,Whom I intend to serve with all my soul from hence-forward;Knowing one's master, 'tis easier far to give satisfaction,By rememb'ring the things which he deems of the highest importance,And on which he has set his heart with the greatest decision.Tell me, then, how best I can win your father and mother."

　　Then the good and sensible youth made answer as follows"You are indeed quite right, my kind and excellent maiden,To begin by asking about the tastes of my parents!For I have hitherto striven in vain to satisfy Father,When I look'd after the inn, as well as my regular duty,Working early and late in the field, and tending the vineyard.Mother indeed was contented; she knew how to value my efforts;And she will certainly hold you to be an excellent maiden,If you take care of the house, as though the dwelling your own were.But my father's unlike her; he's fond of outward appearance.Gentle maiden, deem me not cold and void of all feeling,If I disclose my father's nature to you, who're a stranger.Yes, such words have never before escaped, I assure vonOut of my mouth, which is little accustom'd to babble and chatter;But you have managed to worm all my secrets from out of my bosom.Well, my worthy father the graces of life holds in honour,Wishes for outward signs of love, as well as of rev'rence,And would doubtless be satisfied with an inferior servantWho understood this fancy, and hate a better, who did not."

　　Cheerfully she replied, with gentle movement increasingThrough the darkening path the speed at which she was walking:I in truth shall hope to satisfy both of your parents,For your mother's character my own nature resembles,And to external graces have I from my youth been accustom'd.Our old neighbours, the French, in their earlier days laid much stress onCourteous demeanour; 'twas common alike to nobles and burghers,And to peasants, and each enjoin'd it on all his acquaintance.in the same way, on the side of the Germans, the children were train'd upEvery morning, with plenty of kissing of hands and of curtsies,To salute their parents, and always to act with politeness.All that I have learnt, and all I have practised since childhood,All that comes from my heart,--I will practise it all with the old man.But on what terms shall I--I scarcely dare ask such a question,--Be with yourself, the only son, and hereafter my master?"

　　Thus she spoke, and at that moment they came to the peartree.Down from the skies the moon at her full was shining in glory;Night had arrived, and the last pale gleam of the sunset had vanish'd.So before them were lying, in masses all heap'd up together,Lights as clear as the day, and shadows of night and of darkness.And the friendly question was heard by Hermann with pleasure,Under the shade of the noble tree at the spot which he loved soWhich that day had witness'd his tears at the fate of the exile.And whilst they sat themselves down, to take a little repose there,Thus the loving youth spoke, whilst he seized the hand of the maiden"Let your heart give the answer, and always obey what it tells you!"But he ventured to say no more, however propitiousWas the moment; he feard that a No would be her sole answer,Ah! and he felt the ring on her finger, that sorrowful token.So by the side of each other they quietly sat and in silence,But the maiden began to speak, and said, "How delightfulIs the light of the moon! The clearness of day it resembles.Yonder I see in the town the houses and courtyards quite plainly,In the gable a window; methinks all the panes I can reckon."

　　"That which you see," replied the youth, who spoke with an effort,"That is our house down to which I now am about to conduct you,And that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic,Which will probably soon be yours, as we're making great changes.All these fields are ours, and ripe for the harvest to-morrow;Here in the shade we are wont to rest, enjoying our meal-time.But let us now descend across the vineyard and garden,For observe how the threatening storm is hitherward rolling,Lightening first, and then eclipsing the beautiful full moon."So the pair arose, and wauder'd down by the corn-field,

　　Through the powerful corn, in the nightly clearness rejoicing;And they reach'd the vineyard, and through its dark shadows proceeded.So he guided her down the numerous tiers of the flat stonesWhich, in an unhewn state, served as steps to the walk through the foliage.Slowly she descended, and placed her hands on his shoulders;And, with a quivering light, the moon through the foliage o'erlook'd them,Till by storm-clouds envelop'd, she left the couple in darkness.Then the strong youth supported the maiden, who on him was leaning;She, however, not knowing the path, or observing the rough steps,Slipp'd as she walk'd, her foot gave way, and she well nigh was falling.Hastily held out his arm the youth with nimbleness thoughtful,And held up his beloved one; she gently sank on his shoulders,Breast was press'd against breast, and cheek against cheek, and so stood heFix'd like a marble statue, restrained by a firm resolution;He embraced her no closer, thoughall her weight he supported;So he felt his noble burden, the warmth of her bosom,And her balmy breath, against his warm lips exhaling,Bearing with manly feelings the woman's heroical greatness.

　　But she conceal'd the pain which she felt, and jestingly spoke thus"It betokens misfortune,--so scrupulous people inform us,--For the foot to give way on entering a house, near the threshold.I should have wish'd, in truth, for a sign of some happier omen!Let us tarry a little, for fear your parents should blame youFor their limping servant, and you should be thought a bad landlord."-----IX.  URANIA.

　　CONCLUSION.

　　O YE Muses, who gladly favour a love that is heartfelt,Who on his way the excellent youth have hitherto guided,Who have press'd the maid to his bosom before their betrothal,Help still further to perfect the bonds of a couple so loving,Drive away the clouds which over their happiness hover!But begin by saying what now in the house has been passing.

　　For the third time the mother impatiently enter'd the chamberWhere the men were sitting, which she had anxiously quitted,Speaking of the approaching storm, and the loss of the moon's light,Then of her son's long absence, and all the perils that night brings.Strongly she censured their friends for having so soon left the youngster,For not even addressing the maiden, or seeking to woo her.

　　"Make not the worst of the mischief," the father peevishly answer'd;"For you see we are waiting ourselves, expecting the issue."

　　But the neighbour sat still, and calmly address'd them as follows:--"In uneasy moments like these, I always feel gratefulTo my late father, who when I was young all seeds of impatienceIn my mind uprooted, and left no fragment remaining,And I learnt how to wait, as well as the best of the wise men."Tell us what legerdemain he employ'd," the pastor made answer."I will gladly inform you, and each one may gain by the lesson,"Answer'd the neighbour. "When I was a boy, I was standing one SundayIn a state of impatience, eagerly waiting the carriageWhich was to carry us out to the fountain under the lime-trees;But it came not; I ran like a weasel now hither, now thither,Up and down the stairs, and from the door to the window;Both my hands were prickling, I scratch'd away at the tables,Stamping and trotting about, and scarcely refrain'd I from crying.All this the calm man composedly saw; but finally when ICarried my folly too far, by the arm he quietly took me,Led me up to the window, and used this significant language'See you up yonder the joiner's workshop, now closed for the Sunday?'Twill be re-open'd to-morrow, and plane and saw will be working.Thus will the busy hours be pass'd from morning till evening.But remember this: the rimming will soon be arriving,When the master, together with all his men, will be busyIn preparing and finishing quickly and deftly your coffin,And they will carefully bring over here that house made of boards, whichWill at length receive the patient as well as impatient,And which is destined to carry a roof that's unpleasantly heavy.All that he mention'd I forthwith saw taking place in my mind's eye,Saw the boards join'd together, and saw the black cover made ready,Patiently then I sat, and meekly awaited the carriage.And I always think of the coffin whenever I see menRunning about in a state of doubtful and wild expectation."

　　Smilingly answered the pastor:--"Death's stirring image is neitherUnto the wise a cause of alarm,--or an end to the pious.Back into life it urges the former, and teaches him action,And, for the weal of the latter, it strengthens his hope in affliction.Death is a giver of life unto both. Your father did wronglyWhen to the sensitive boy he pointed out death in its own form.Unto the youth should be shown the worth of a noble and ripen'dAge, and unto the old man, youth, that both may rejoice inThe eternal circle, and life may in life be made perfect!"

　　Here the door was open'd. The handsome couple appear'd there,And the friends were amazed, the loving parents astonish'dAt the form of the bride, the form of the bridegroom resembling.Yes! the door appear'd too small to admit the tall figuresWhich now cross'd the threshold, in company walking together.To his parents Hermann presented her, hastily saying:--"Here is a maiden just of the sort you are wishing to have here,Welcome her kindly, dear father! she fully deserves it, and you too,Mother dear, ask her questions as to her housekeeping knowledge,That you may see how well she deserves to form one of our party."Then he hastily took on one side the excellent pastor,Saying:--" Kind sir, I entreat you to help me out of this troubleQuickly, and loosen the knot, whose unravelling I am so dreading;For I have not ventured to woo as my bride the fair maiden,But she believes she's to be a maid in the house, and I fear meShe will in anger depart, as soon as we talk about marriage.But it must be decided at once! no longer in errorShall she remain, and I no longer this doubt can put up with.Hasten and once more exhibit that wisdom we all hold in honour."So the pastor forthwith turn'd round to the rest of the party,But the maiden's soul was, unhappily, troubled alreadyBy the talk of the father, who just had address'd her as follows,Speaking good humour'dly, and in accents pleasant and lively"Yes, I'm well satisfied, child! I joyfully see that my son hasJust as good taste as his father, who in his younger days show'd it,Always leading the fairest one out in the dance, and then lastlyTaking the fairest one home as his wife--'twas your dear little mother!For by the bride whom a man selects, we may easily gatherWhat kind of spirit his is, and whether he knows his own value.But you will surely need but a short time to form your decision,For I verily think he will find it full easy to follow."Hermann but partially heard the words; the whole of his membersInwardly quivered, and all the circle were suddenly silent.

　　But the excellent maiden, by words of such irony wounded,(As she esteem'd them to be) and deeply distress'd in her spirit,Stood, while a passing flush from her cheeks as far as her neck wasSpreading, but she restrain'd herself, and collected her thoughts soon;Then to the old man she said, not fully concealing her sorrow"Truly I was not prepared by your son for such a reception,When he described his father's nature,--that excellent burgher,And I know I am standing before you, a person of culture,Who behaves himself wisely to all, in a suitable manner.But it would seem that you feel not pity enough for the poor thingWho has just cross'd your threshold, prepared to enter your serviceElse you would not seek to point out, with ridicule bitter,How far removed my lot from your son's and that of yourself is.True, with a little bundle, and poor, I have enter'd your dwelling,Which it is the owner's delight to furnish with all things.But I know myself well, and feel the whole situation.Is it generous thus to greet me with language so jeering,Which was well nigh expelled me the house, when just on the threshold?"

　　Hermann uneasily moved about, and signed to the pastorTo interpose without delay, and clear up the error.Quickly the wise man advanced to the spot, and witness'd the maiden'sSilent vexation and tearful eyes and scarce-restrain'd sorrow.Then his spirit advised him to solve not at once the confusion,But, on the contrary, prove the excited mind of the maiden.So, in words framed to try her, the pastor address'd her as follows:--"Surely, my foreign maiden, you did not fully consider,When you made up your mind to serve a stranger so quickly,What it really is to enter the house of a master;For a shake of the hand decides your fate for a twelvemonth,And a single word Yes to much endurance will bind you.But the worst part of the service is not the wearisome habits,Nor the bitter toil of the work, which seems never-ending;For the active freeman works hard as well as the servant.But to suffer the whims of the master, who blames you unjustly,Or who calls for this and for that, not knowing his own mind,And the mistress's violence, always so easily kindled,With the children's rough and supercilious bad manners,--This is indeed hard to bear, whilst still fulfilling your dutiesPromptly and actively, never becoming morose or ill-natured;Yet for such work you appear little fit, for already the father'sJokes have offended you deeply; yet nothing more commonly happensThan to tease a maiden about her liking a youngster."Thus he spoke, and the maiden felt the weight of his language,And no more restrain'd herself; mightily all her emotionsShow'd themselves, her bosom heaved, and a deep sigh escaped her,And whilst shedding burning tears, she answer'd as follows:--"Ne'er does the clever man, who seeks to advise us in sorrow,Think how little his chilling words our hearts can deliverFrom the pangs which an unseen destiny fastens upon us.You are happy and merry. How then should a jest ever wound you?But the slightest touch gives torture to those who are suff'ring.Even dissimulation would nothing avail me at present.Let me at once disclose what later would deepen my sorrow,And consign me perchance to agony mute and consuming.Let me depart forthwith! No more in this house dare I linger;I must hence and away, and look once more for my poor friendsWhom I left in distress, when seeking to better my fortunes.This is my firm resolve; and now I may properly tell youThat which had else been buried for many a year in my bosom.Yes, the father's jest has wounded me deeply, I own it,Not that I'm proud and touchy, as ill becometh a servant,But because in truth in my heart a feeling has risenFor the youth, who to-day has fill'd the part of my Saviour.For when first in the road he left me, his image remain'd stillFirmly fix'd in my mind; and I thought of the fortunate maidenWhom, as his betroth'd one, he cherish'd perchance in his bosom.And when I found him again at the well, the sight of him charm'd meJust as if I had-seen an angel descending from heaven.And I follow'd him willingly, when as a servant he sought me,But by my heart in truth I was flatter'd (I need must confess it),As I hitherward came, that I might possibly win him,If I became in the house an indispensable pillar.But, alas, I now see the dangers I well nigh fell into,When I bethought me of living so near a silently-loved one.Now for the first time I feel how far removed a poor maidenIs from a richer youth, however clever she may be.I have told you all this, that you my heart may mistake not,Which an event that in thought I foreshadow has wounded already.For I must have expected, my secret wishes concealing,That, ere much time had elapsed, I should see him bringing his bride home.And how then could I have endured my hidden affliction!Happily I am warn'd in time, and out of my bosomHas my secret escaped, whilst curable still is the evil.But no more of the subject! I now must tarry no longerIn this house, where I now am standing in pain and confusion,All my foolish hopes and my feelings freely confessing.Not the night which, with sinking clouds, is spreading around us,Not the rolling thunder (I hear it already) shall stop me,Not the falling rain, which outside is descending in torrents,Not the blustering storm. All this I had to encounterIn that sorrowful flight, while the enemy follow'd behind Us.And once more I go on my way, as I long have been wont to,Seized by the whirlpool of time, and parted from all that I care for.So farewell! I'll tarry no longer. My fate is accomplish'd!"

　　Thus she spoke, and towards the door she hastily turn'd her,Holding under her arm the bundle she brought when arriving.But the mother seized by both of her arms the fair maiden,Clasping her round the body, and cried with surprise and amazement"Say, what signifies this? These fruitless tears, what denote they?No, I'll not leave you alone! You're surely my dear son's betroth'd one!"But the father stood still, and show'd a great deal of reluctance,Stared at the weeping girl, and peevishly spoke then as follows"This, then, is all the indulgence my friends are willing to give me,That at the close of the day the most unpleasant thing happens!For there is nothing I hate so much as the tears of a woman,And their passionate cries, set up with such heat and excitement,Which a little plain sense would show to be utterly needless.Truly, I find the sight of these whimsical doings a nuisance.Matters must shift for themselves; as for me, I think it is bed-time."So he quickly turn'd round, and hasten'd to go to the chamberWhere the marriage-bed stood, in which he slept for the most part.But his son held him back, and spoke in words of entreaty"Father, don't go in a hurry, and be not amniote with the maiden!I alone have to bear the blame of all this confusion,Which our friend has increased by his unexpected dissembling.Speak then, honour'd Sir! for to you the affair I confided;Heap not up pain and annoyance, but rather complete the whole matter;For I surely in future should not respect you so highly,If you play practical jokes, instead of displaying true wisdom."

　　Thereupon the worthy pastor smilingly answer'd"What kind of wisdom could have extracted the charming confessionOf this good maiden, and so have reveal'd all her character to us?Is not your care converted at once to pleasure and rapture?Speak out, then, for yourself! Why need explanations from othersHermann then stepped forward, and gently address'd her as follows"Do not repent of your tears, nor yet of your passing affliction;For they perfect my happiness; yours too, I fain would consider.I came not to the fountain, to hire so noble a maidenAs a servant, I came to seek to win you affections.But, alas! my timid gaze had not strength to discoverYour heart's leanings; it saw in your eye but a friendly expression,When you greeted it out of the tranquil fountain's bright mirror.Merely to bring you home, made half of my happiness certainBut you now make it complete! May every blessing be yours, then!"Then the maiden look'd on the youth with heartfelt emotion,And avoided not kiss or embrace, the summit of rapture,When they also are to the loving the long-wish'd-for pledgesOf approaching bliss in a life which now seems to them endless.Then the pastor told the others the whole of the story;But the maiden came and gracefully bent o'er the father,Kissing the while his hand, which he to draw back attempted.And she said:--" I am sure that you will forgive the surprised one,First for her tears of sorrow, and then for her tears of true rapture.O forgive the emotions by which they both have been prompted,And let me fully enjoy the bliss that has now been vouchsafed me!Let the first vexation, which my confusion gave rise to,Also be the last! The loving service which latelyWas by the servant promised, shall now by the daughter be render'd."

　　And the father, his tears concealing, straightway embraced her;Lovingly came the mother in turn, and heartily kiss'd her,Warmly shaking her hand; and silently wept they together.Then in a hasty manner, the good and sensible pastorSeized the hand of the father, his wedding-ring off from his fingerDrawing (not easily though; so plump was the member that held it)Then he took the mother's ring, and betroth'd the two children,Saying:--"Once more may it be these golden hoops' destinationFirmly to fasten a bond altogether resembling the old one!For this youth is deeply imbued with love for the maiden,And the maiden confesses that she for the youth has a liking.Therefore, I now betroth you, and wish you all blessings hereafter,With the parents' consent, and with our friend here as a witness."

　　And the neighbour bent forward, and added his own benediction;But when the clergyman placed the gold ring on the hand of the maiden,He with astonishment saw the one which already was on it,And which Hermann before at the fountain had anxiously noticed.Whereupon he spoke in words at once friendly and jesting"What! You are twice engaging yourself? I hope that the first oneMay not appear at the altar, unkindly forbidding the banns there!"

　　But she said in reply:--"O let me devote but one momentTo this mournful remembrance! For well did the good youth deserve it,Who, when departing, presented the ring, but never return'd home.All was by him foreseen, when freedom's love of a sudden,And a desire to play his part in the new-found Existence,Drove him to go to Paris, where prison and death were his portion.'Farewell,' said he, 'I go; for all things on earth are in motionAt this moment, and all things appear in a state of disunion.Fundamental laws in the steadiest countries are loosen'd,And possessions are parted from those who used to possess them,Friends are parted from friends, and love is parted from love too.I now leave you here, and whether I ever shall see youHere again,--who can tell? Perchance these words will our last be.Man is a stranger here upon earth, the proverb informs us;Every person has now become more a stranger than ever.Ours the soil is no longer; our treasures are fast flying from us;All the sacred old vessels of gold and silver are melted,All is moving, as though the old-fashion'd world would roll backwardsInto chaos and night, in order anew to be fashion'd.You of my heart have possession, and if we shall ever here-afterMeet again over the wreck of the world, it will be as new creatures,All remodell'd and free and independent of fortune;For what fetters can bind down those who survive such a period!But if we are destined not to escape from these dangers,If we are never again to embrace each other with rapturesO then fondly keep in your thoughts my hovering image,That you may be prepared with like courage for good and ill fortune!If a new home or a new alliance should chance to allure you,Then enjoy with thanks whatever your destiny offers,Purely loving the loving, and grateful to him who thus loves you.But remember always to tread with a circumspect footstep,For the fresh pangs of a second loss will behind you be lurking.Deem each day as sacred; but value not life any higherThan any other possession, for all possessions are fleeting.'Thus he spoke; and the noble youth and I parted for ever:Meanwhile I ev'rything lost, and a thousand times thought of his warning.Once more I think of his words, now that love is sweetly preparingHappiness for me anew, and the brightest of hopes is unfolding.Pardon me, dearest friend, for trembling e'en at the momentWhen I am clasping your arm! For thus, on first landing, the sailorFancies that even the solid ground is shaking beneath him."

　　Thus she spoke, and she placed the rings by the side of each other.But the bridegroom answer'd, with noble and manly emotion"All the firmer, amidst the universal disruption,Be, Dorothea, our union! We'll show ourselves bold and enduring,Firmly hold our own, and firmly retain our possessions.For the man who in wav'ring times is inclined to be wav'ringOnly increases the evil, and spreads it wider and wider;But the man of firm decision the universe fashions.'Tis not becoming the Germans to further this fearful commotion,And in addition to waver uncertainly hither and thither.'This is our own!' we ought to say, and so to maintain it!For the world will ever applaud those resolute nationsWho for God and the Law, their wives, and parents, and childrenStruggle, and fall when contending against the foeman together.You are mine; and now what is mine, is mine more than ever.Not with anxiety will I preserve it, or timidly use it,But with courage and strength. And if the enemy threatenNow or hereafter, I'll hold myself ready, and reach down my weapons.If I know that the house and my parents by you are protected,I shall expose my breast to the enemy, void of all terror;And if all others thought thus, then might against might should be measured,And in the early prospect of peace we should all be rejoicing."

　　1796?.-----WEST-EASTERN DIVAN.-----Who the song would understand,Needs must seek the song's own land.Who the minstrel understand,Needs must seek the minstrel's land.-----

　　THE Poems comprised in this collection are written in thePersian style, and are greatly admired by Oriental scholars, forthe truthfulness with which the Eastern spirit of poetry isreproduced by the Western minstrel. They were chiefly composedbetween the years 1814 and 1819, and first given to the world inthe latter year. Of the twelve books into which they are divided,that of Suleika will probably be considered the best, from themany graceful love-songs which it contains. The following isHanoi's account of the Divan, and may well serve as a substitutefor anything I could say respecting it:--

　　It contains opinions and sentiments on the East, expressed in aseries of rich cantos and stanzas full of sweetness and spirit,and all this as enchanting as a harem emitting the most deliciousand rare perfumes, and blooming with exquisitely-lovely nymphswith eyebrows painted black, eyes piercing as those of theantelope, arms white as alabaster, and of the most graceful andperfectly-formed shapes, while the heart of the reader beats andgrows faint, as did that of the happy Gaspard Debaran, the clown,who, when on the highest step of his ladder, was enabled to peepinto the Seraglio of Constantinople--that recess concealed fromthe inspection of man. Sometimes also the reader may imaginehimself indolently stretched on a carpet of Persian softness,luxuriously smoking the yellow tobacco of Turkistan through along tube of jessamine and amber, while a black slave fans himwith a fan of peacock's feathers, and a little boy presents himwith a cup of genuine Mocha. Goethe has put these enchanting andvoluptuous customs into poetry, and his verses are so perfect, soharmonious, so tasteful, so soft, that it seems really surprisingthat he should ever have been able to have brought the Germanlanguage to this state of suppleness. The charm of the book isinexplicable; it is a votive nosegay sent from the West to theEast, composed of the most precious and curious plants: redroses, hortensias like the breast of a spotless maiden, purpledigitalis like the long finger of a man, fantastically formedranunculi, and in the midst of all, silent and tastefullyconcealed, a tuft of German violets. This nosegay signifies thatthe West is tired of thin and icy-cold spirituality, and seekswarmth in the strong and healthy bosom of the East."

　　An open heart that knows no wrong.

　　And what though all the world should sink!

I'm another.Thou a greybeard art--so I am;Land and men we make to stiffen.Thou art Mars! And I Saturnus,--Both are evil-working planets,When united, horror-fraught.Thou dost kill the soul, thou freezesE'en the atmosphere; still colderIs my breath than thine was ever.Thy wild armies vex the faithfulWith a thousand varying torments;Well! God grant that I discoverEven worse, before I perish!And by God, I'll give thee none.Let God hear what now I tell thee!Yes, by God! from Death's cold clutchesNought, O greybeard, shall protect thee,Not the hearth's broad coalfire's ardour,Not December's brightest flame."

　　For Joseph, need cause no surprise;

　　He was young, youth pleaseth the eyes,--

　　He was fair, they say, beyond measure

　　Fair was she, and so great was their pleasure.But that thou, who awaitedst me long,Youthful glances of fire dost throw me,Soon wilt bless me, thy love now dost show me,This shall my joyous numbers proclaim,Thee I for ever Suleika shall name.

　　Observe, my loved one, well!And see the fruits they bear

　　In green and prickly shell!

　　They've hung roll'd up, till now,

　　Unconsciously and still;A loosely-waving bough

　　Doth rock them at its will.

　　Yet, ripening from within.

　　The kernel brown swells fast;It seeks the air to win,

　　It seeks the sun at last.

　　With joy it bursts its thrall,

　　The shell must needs give way.'Tis thus my numbers fall

　　Before thy feet, each day.

　　1815.-----SULEIKA.

　　WHAT is by this stir reveal'd?

　　Doth the East glad tidings bring?For my heart's deep wounds are heal'd

　　By his mild and cooling wing.

　　He the dust with sports doth meet,

　　And in gentle cloudlets chase;To the vineleaf's safe retreat

　　Drives the insects' happy race,

　　Cools these burning cheeks of mine,

　　Checks the sun's fierce glow Adam,Kisses, as he flies, the vine,

　　Flaunting over hill and plain.

　　And his whispers soft convey

　　Thousand greetings from my friend;Ere these hills own night's dark sway,

　　Kisses greet me, without end.

　　Thus canst thou still onward go,

　　Serving friend and mourner too!There, where lofty ramparts glow,

　　Soon the loved one shall I view.

　　Ah, what makes the heart's truth known,--

　　Love's sweet breath,--a newborn life,--Learn I from his mouth alone,

　　In his breath alone is rife!

　　1815.-----THE SUBLIME TYPE.

　　THE sun, whom Grecians Helms call,

　　His heavenly path with pride doth tread,And, to subdue the world's wide all,

　　Looks round, beneath him, high o'er head.

　　He sees the fairest goddess pine,

　　Heaven's child, the daughter of the clouds,--For her alone he seems to shine;

　　In trembling grief his form he shrouds,

　　Careless for all the realms of bliss,--

　　Her streaming tears more swiftly flow:For every pearl he gives a kiss,

　　And changeth into joy her woe.

　　She gazeth upward fixedly,

　　And deeply feels his glance of might,While, stamped with his own effigy,

　　Each pearl would range itself aright.

　　Thus wreath'd with bows, with hues thus grac'd,

　　With gladness beams her face so fair,While he, to meet her, maketh haste,

　　And yet, alas! can reach her ne'er.

　　So, by the harsh decree of Fate,

　　Thou modest from me, dearest one;And were I Helms e'en, the Great,

　　What would avail his chariot-throne?

　　1815.-----SULEIKA.

　　ZEPHYR, for thy humid wing,

　　Oh, how much I envy thee!Thou to him canst tidings bring

　　How our parting saddens me!

　　In my breast, a yearning still

　　As thy pinions wave, appears;Flow'rs and eyes, and wood, and hill

　　At thy breath are steeped in tears.

　　Yet thy mild wing gives relief,

　　Soothes the aching eyelid's pain;Ah, I else had died for grief,

　　Him ne'er hoped to see again.

　　To my love, then, quick repair,

　　Whisper softly to his heart;Yet, to give him pain, beware,

　　Nor my bosom's pangs impart.

　　Tell him, but in accents coy,

　　That his love must be my life;Both, with feelings fraught with joy,

　　In his presence will be rife.

　　1815.-----THE REUNION.

　　CAN it be! of stars the star,

　　Do I press thee to my heart?In the night of distance far,

　　What deep gulf, what bitter smart!Yes, 'tis thou, indeed, at last,

　　Of my joys the partner dear!Mindful, though, of sorrows past,

　　I the present needs must fear.

　　When the still-unfashion'd earth

　　Lay on God's eternal breast,He ordain'd its hour of birth,

　　With creative joy possess'd.Then a heavy sigh arose,

　　When He spake the sentence:--"Be!"And the All, with mighty throes,

　　Burst into reality.

　　And when thus was born the light,

　　Darkness near it fear'd to stay,And the elements with might

　　Fled on every side away;Each on some far-distant trace,

　　Each with visions wild employ,Numb, in boundless realm of space,

　　Harmony and feeling-void.

　　Dumb was all, all still and dead,

　　For the first time, God alone!Then He form'd the morning-red,

　　Which soon made its kindness known:It unravelled from the waste,

　　Bright and glowing harmony,And once more with love was grac'd

　　What contended formerly.

　　And with earnest, noble strife,

　　Each its own Peculiar sought;Back to full, unbounded life

　　Sight and feeling soon were brought.Wherefore, if 'tis done, explore

　　How? why give the manner, name?Allah need create no more,

　　We his world ourselves can frame.

　　So, with morning pinions bright,

　　To thy mouth was I impell'd;Stamped with thousand seals by night,

　　Star-clear is the bond fast held.Paragons on earth are we

　　Both of grief and joy sublime,And a second sentence:--"Be!"

　　Parts us not a second time.

　　1815.-----SULEIKA.

　　WITH what inward joy, sweet lay,

　　I thy meaning have descried!Lovingly thou seem'st to say

　　That I'm ever by his side;

　　That he ever thinks of me,

　　That he to the absent givesAll his love's sweet ecstasy,

　　While for him alone she lives.

　　Yes, the mirror which reveals

　　Thee, my loved one, is my breast;This the bosom, where thy seals

　　Endless kisses have impress'd.

　　Numbers sweet, unsullied truth,

　　Chain me down in sympathy!Love's embodied radiant youth,

　　In the garb of poesy!

　　1819.*-----IN thousand forms mayst thou attempt surprise,

　　Yet, all-beloved-one, straight know I thee;Thou mayst with magic veils thy face disguise,

　　And yet, all-present-one, straight know I thee.

　　Upon the cypress' purest, youthful bud,

　　All-beauteous-growing-one, straight know I thee;In the canal's unsullied, living flood,

　　All-captivating-one, well know I thee.

　　When spreads the water-column, rising proud,

　　All-sportive one, how gladly know I thee;When, e'en in forming, is transform'd the cloud,

　　All-figure-changing-one, there know I thee.

　　Veil in the meadow-carpet's flowery charms,

　　All-checkered-starry-fair-one, know I thee;And if a plant extend its thousand arms,

　　O, all-embracing-one, there know I thee.

　　When on the mount is kindled morn's sweet light,

　　Straightway, all-gladdening-one, salute I thee,The arch of heaven o'er head grows pure and bright,--

　　All-heart-expanding-one, then breathe I thee.

　　That which my inward, outward sense proclaims,

　　Thou all-instructing-one, I know through thee;And if I utter Allah's hundred names,

　　A name with each one echoes, meant for thee.

　　'Tis worth not a thought!Can the Koran a creation, then, be?

　　Of that, I know nought!Yet that the book of all books it must be,

　　I believe, as a Mussulman ought.That from Eternity wine, though, must be,

　　I ever have thought;That 'twas ordain'd, ere the Angels, to be,

　　As a truth may be taught.Drinkers, however these matters may be,

　　Gaze on God's face, fearing nought.

　　1815.-----YE'VE often, for our drunkenness,

　　Blamed us in ev'ry way,And, in abuse of drunkenness,

　　Enough can never say.Men, overcome by drunkenness,

　　Are wont to lie till day;And yet I find my drunkenness

　　All night-time make me stray;For, oh! 'tis Love's sweet drunkenness

　　That maketh me its prey,Which night and day, and day and night,

　　My heart must needs obey,--A heart that, in its drunkenness,

　　Pours forth full many a lay,So that no trifling drunkenness

　　Can dare assert its sway.Love, song, and wine's sweet drunkenness,

　　By night-time and by day,--How god-like is the drunkenness

　　That maketh me its prey!

　　1815.-----ALL kinds of men, both small and great,A fine-spun web delight to create,And in the middle they take their place,And wield their scissors with wondrous grace.But if a besom should sweep that way:"What a most shameful thing," they say,--"They've crush'd a mighty palace to-day."

　　1815.-----IT IS GOOD.

　　IN Paradise while moonbeams play'd,

　　Jehovah found, in slumber deep,Adam fast sunk; He gently laid

　　Eve near him,--she, too, fell asleep.There lay they now, on earth's fair shrine,God's two most beauteous thoughts divine.--When this He saw, He cried:--'Tis Good!!!And scarce could move from where He stood.

　　No wonder, that our joy's completeWhile eye and eye responsive meet,When this blest thought of rapture moves us--That we're with Him who truly loves us,And if He cries:--Good, let it be!'Tis so for both, it seems to me.Thou'rt clasp'd within these arms of mine,Dearest of all God's thoughts divine!

　　THE BEQUEST OF THE ANCIENT PERSIAN FAITH.

　　BRETHREN, what bequest to you should comeFrom the lowly poor man, going home,Whom ye younger ones with patience tended,Whose last days ye honour'd and defended?

　　When we oft have seen the monarch ride,Gold upon him, gold on ev'ry side;Jewels on him, on his courtiers all,Thickly strewed as hailstones when they fall,

　　Have ye e'er known envy at the sight?And not felt your gaze become more bright,When the sun was, on the wings of morning,Darnawend's unnumber'd peaks adorning,

　　As he, bow-like, rose? How each eye dweltOn the glorious scene! I felt, I felt,Thousand times, as life's days fleeted by,Borne with him, the coming one, on high.

　　God upon His throne then to proclaim,Him, the life-fount's mighty Lord, to name,Worthily to prize that glorious sight,And to wander on beneath His light.

　　When the fiery orb was all defined,There I stood, as though in darkness, blind,Beat my breast, my quicken'd members threwOn the earth, brow-foremost, at the view.

　　Let this holy, great bequest rewardBrotherly good-will and kind regard:SOLEMN DUTY'S DAILY observation.--More than this, it needs no revelation.

　　If its gentle hands a new-born oneMove, then straightway turn it tow'rd the sun,--Soul and body dip in bath of fire!Then each morning's favour 'twill acquire.

　　To the living one, commit the dead,O'er the beast let earth and dust be spread,And, so far as may extend your might,What ye deem impure, conceal from sight.

　　Till your plains to graceful purity,That the sun with joy your labours see;When ye plant, your trees in rows contrive,For he makes the Regular to thrive.

　　E'en the floods that through the channel rushMust not fail in fulness or in gush;And as Senderud, from mountain high,Rises pure, in pureness must it die.

　　Not to weaken water's gentle fall,Carefully cleanse out the channels all;Salamander, snake, and rush, and reed,--All destroy,--each monster and each weed.

　　If thus pure ye earth and water keep,Through the air the sun will gladly peep,Where he, worthily enshrined in space,Worketh life, to life gives holy grace.

　　Ye, by toil on toil so sorely tried,Comfort take, the All is purified;And now man, as priest, may boldly dareFrom the stone God's image to prepare.

　　When the flame burns joyously and bright,Limbs are supple, radiant is the night;On the hearth when fire with ardour glows,Ripe the sap of plants and creatures grows.

　　Dragging wood, with rapture be it done,'Tis the seed of many an earthly sun;Plucking Pambeh, gladly may ye say:--This, as wick, the Holy will convey.

　　If ye meekly, in each burning lamp,See the nobler light's resplendent stamp,Ne'er will Fate prevent you, void of feeling,At God's throne at morningtide from kneeling.

　　This is Being's mighty signet, then,God's pure glass to angels and to men;Each word lisped the Highest's praise to sound,Ring in ring, united there is found.

　　From the shore of Senderud ascendeth,Up to Darnawend its pinions bendeth,As He dawns, with joy to greet His light,You with endless blessings to requite.

　　AFTER THE BATTLE OF BADE, BENEATH THE CANOPY OF HEAVEN.

　　[This battle was fought in the second year of the Hegira (A.A.623), between the followers of Mahomet, who numbered threehundred and thirteen, possessing two horses and seventy camels,and the 'idolaters,' or Meccans, whose forces amounted to ninehundred and fifty, including two hundred cavalry. The victoryremained with Mahomet, who lost fourteen men, while seventy ofthe enemy were slain. A great accession of strength ensued inconsequence to the Prophet, who pretended that miracles werewrought in his behalf in the battle, God having sent angels tofight on his side, and having also made his army to appear largerto the enemy than it really was.--See the Koran, chapter viii.,and ABULFEDA'S Life of Mahomet.]

　　MAHOMET (Speaks).

　　LET the foeman sorrow o'er his dead,

　　Ne'er will they return again to light;O'er our brethren let no tear be shed,

　　For they dwell above yon spheres so bright.

　　All the seven planets open throw

　　All their metal doors with mighty shock,And the forms of those we loved below

　　At the gates of Eden boldly knock.

　　There they find, with bliss ne'er dream'd before,

　　Glories that my flight first show'd to eye,When the wondrous steed my person bore

　　In one second through the realms on high.

　　Wisdom's trees, in cypress-order growing,

　　High uphold the golden apples sweet;Trees of life, their spreading shadows throwing,

　　Shade each blossoming plant, each flow'ry seat.

　　Now a balmy zephyr from the East

　　Brings the heavenly maidens to thy view;With the eye thou now dost taste the feast,

　　Soon the sight pervades thee through and through.

　　There they stand, to ask thee thy career:

　　Mighty plans? or dangerous bloody rout?Thou'rt a hero, know they,--for Thourt here,

　　What a hero?--This they'll fathom out.

　　By thy wounds soon clearly this is shown,

　　Wounds that write thy fame's undying story;Wounds the true believer mark alone,

　　When have perish'd joy and earthly glory.

　　To chiosks and arbors thou art brought,

　　Fill'd with checkered marble columns bright;To the noble grape-juice, solace-fraught,

　　They the guest with kindly sips invite.

　　Youth! Thou'rt welcome more than e'er was youth

　　All alike are radiant and serene;When thou tak'st one to thine heart with truth,

　　Of thy band she'll be the friend and queen.

　　So prepare thee for this place of rest,

　　Never can it now be changed again;Maids like these will ever make thee blest,

　　Wines like these will never harm thy brain.

　　1819.-----THE FAVOURED BEASTS.

　　Or beasts there have been chosen four

　　To come to Paradise,And there with saints for evermore

　　They dwell in happy wise.

　　Amongst them all the Ass stands first;

　　He comes with joyous stride,For to the Prophet-City erst

　　Did Jesus on him ride.

　　Half timid next a Wolf doth creep,

　　To whom Mahomet spake"Spoil not the poor man of his sheep,

　　The rich man's thou mayst take."

　　And then the brave and faithful Hound,

　　Who by his master kept,And slept with him the slumbers sound

　　The seven sleepers slept.

　　Abuherrira's Cat, too, here,

　　Purrs round his master blest,For holy must the beast appear

　　The Prophet hath caress'd.

　　1815.-----THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.

　　Six among the courtiers favour'dFly before the Caesar's fury,Who would as a god be worshipp'd,Though in truth no god appearing,For a fly prevents him everFrom enjoying food at table.Though with fans his servants scare it,They the fly can never banish.It torments him, stings, and troubles,And the festal board perplexes,Then returning like the heraldOf the olden crafty Fly-God."What!"--the striplings say together--"Shall a fly a god embarrass?

　　Shall a god drink, eat at table,Like us mortals? No, the Only,Who the sun and moon created,And the glowing stars arch'd o'er us,He is God,--we'll fly!"--The gentle,Lightly shod, and dainty striplingsDid a shepherd meet, and hide them,With himself, within a cavern.

　　And the sheep-dog will not leave them,--Scared away, his foot all-mangled,To his master still he presses,And he joins the hidden party,Joins the favorites of slumber.

　　And the prince, whom they had fled from,Fondly-furious, thinks of vengeance,And, discarding sword and fire,Has them walled-up in the cavern,Walled-up fast with bricks and mortar.

　　But the others slumber ever,And the Angel, their protector,Gives before God's throne this notice"To the right and left alternateHave I ever cared to turn them,That their fair and youthful membersBe not by the mould-damp injured;Clefts within the rocks I open'd,That the sun may, rising, setting,Keep their cheeks in youthful freshness."So they lie there, bless'd by Heaven.And, with forepaws sound and scatheless,Sleeps the dog in gentle slumber.

　　Years come round, and years fly onward,And the youths at length awaken,And the wall, which now had moldered,From its very age has fallen.And Jamblika says,--whose beautyFar exceedeth all the others,--When the fearful shepherd lingers:--"I will run, and food procure you,Life and piece of gold I'll wager!"--Ephebus had many a year nowOwn'd the teaching of the ProphetJesus (Peace be with the Good One!)

　　And he ran, and at the gatewayWere the warders and the others.Yet he to the nearest baker's,Seeking bread, went swiftly onwards.--"Rogue!" thus cried the baker--"hast thou,Youth, a treasure, then, discover'd?Give me,--for the gold betrays thee,--Give me half, to keep thy secret!"--

　　And they quarrel.--To the monarchComes the matter; and the monarchFain would halve it, like the baker.

　　Now the miracle is provenSlowly by a hundred tokens.He can e'en his right establishTo the palace he erected,For a pillar, when pierced open.

　　Leads to wealth he said 'twould lead to.Soon are gather'd there whole races,Their relationship to show him.And as great-grandfather, noblyStands Jamblika's youthful figure.

　　As of ancestors, he hears them,Speaking of his son and grandsons.His great-grandsons stand around him,Like a race of valiant mortals,Him to honour,--him, the youngest.And one token on anotherRises up, the proof completing;The identity is provenOf himself, and of his comrades.

　　Now returns he to the cavern,With him go both king and people.--Neither to the king nor peopleE'er returns that chosen mortal;For the Seven, who for ages--Eight was, with the dog, their number--Had from all the world been sunder'd,Gabriel's mysterious power,To the will of God obedient,Hath to Paradise conducted,--And the cave was closed for ever.

　　I.DEDICATION.

　　YE shadowy forms, again ye're drawing near,

　　So wont of yore to meet my troubled gaze!Were it in vain to seek to keep you here?

　　Loves still my heart that dream of olden days?Oh, come then! and in pristine force appear,

　　Parting the vapor mist that round me plays!My bosom finds its youthful strength again,Feeling the magic breeze that marks your train.

　　Ye bring the forms of happy days of yore,

　　And many a shadow loved attends you too;Like some old lay, whose dream was well nigh o'er,

　　First-love appears again, and friendship true;Upon life's labyrinthine path once more

　　Is heard the sigh, and grief revives anew;The friends are told, who, in their hour of pride,Deceived by fortune, vanish'd from my side.

　　No longer do they hear my plaintive song,

　　The souls to whom I sang in life's young day;Scatter'd for ever now the friendly throng,

　　And mute, alas! each sweet responsive lay.My strains but to the careless crowd belong,

　　Their smiles but sorrow to my heart convey;And all who heard my numbers erst with gladness,If living yet, roam o'er the earth in sadness.

　　Long buried yearnings in my breast arise,

　　Yon calm and solemn spirit-realm to gain;Like the AEONIAN harp's sweet melodies,

　　My murmuring song breathes forth its changeful strain.A trembling seizes me, tears fill mine eyes,

　　And softer grows my rugged heart amain.All I possess far distant seems to be,The vanish'd only seems reality.

　　THE sun still chaunts, as in old time,

　　As when first form'd in majesty.

　　GABRIEL.

　　And swift and swift, in wondrous guise,

　　Revolves the earth in splendour bright,The radiant hues of Paradise

　　The spheres whirl round in endless motion.

　　And storms in emulation growl

　　From land to sea, from sea to land,And fashion, as they wildly howl,

　　The soft mutations of Thy day.

　　VANISH, dark clouds on high,

　　Offspring of night!Let a more radiant beamThrough the blue ether gleam,

　　Charming the sight!Would the dark clouds on high

　　Melt into air!Stars glimmer tenderly,

　　Planets more fair

　　Shed their soft light.Spirits of heav'nly birth,Fairer than sons of earth,Quivering emotions true

　　Hover above;Yearning affections, too,

　　In their train move.See how the spirit-band,By the soft breezes fann'd,Covers the smiling land,--Covers the leafy grove,Where happy lovers rove,Deep in a dream of love,True love that never dies!Bowers on bowers rise,

　　Soft tendrils twine;While from the press escapes,Born of the juicy grapes,

　　Foaming, the wine;And as the current flowsO'er the bright stones it goes,--Leaving the hilly lands

　　Far, far behind,--Into a sea expands,

　　Loving to windRound the green mountain's base;And the glad-winged race,

　　Rapture sip in,As they the sunny light,And the fair islands bright,

　　Hasten to win,That on the billows playWith sweet deceptive ray,Where in glad choral songShout the exulting throng;Where on the verdant plain

　　Dancers we see,Spreading themselves amain

　　Over the lea.Some boldly climbing are

　　O'er the steep brake,Others are floating far

　　O'er the smooth lake.All for a purpose move,

　　All with life teem,While the sweet stars above

　　Blissfully gleam.

　　MY heart is sad,

　　His voice so fraught

　　With magic bliss,His hand's soft pressure,

　　And, ah, his kiss!

　　My heart is sad,

　　My peace is o'er;I find it never

　　And nevermore.

　　My bosom yearns

　　For his form so fair;Ah, could I clasp him

　　And hold him there!

　　My kisses sweet

　　Should stop his breath,And 'neath his kisses

　　I'd sink in death!

　　Hang not the heavens their arch overhead?Lies not the earth beneath us, firm?Gleam not with kindly glancesEternal stars on high?Looks not mine eye deep into thine?And do not all thingsCrowd on thy head and heart,And round thee twine, in mystery eterne,Invisible, yet visible?Fill, then, thy heart, however vast, with this,And when the feeling perfecteth thy bliss,O, call it what thou wilt,Call it joy! heart! love! God!No name for it I know!'Tis feeling all--nought else;Name is but sound and smoke,Obscuring heaven's bright glow.

　　[This fine piece, written originally in 1805, on Schiller'sdeath, was altered and recast by Goethe in 1815, on the occasionof the performance on the stage of the Song of the Bell. Hencethe allusion in the last verse.]

　　To this city joy reveal it!

　　Peace as its first signal peal it!

　　(Song of the Bell--concluding lines.)

　　AND so it proved! The nation felt, ere long,

　　That peaceful signal, and, with blessings fraught,A new-born joy appear'd; in gladsome song

　　To hail the youthful princely pair we sought;While in a living, ever-swelling throng

　　Mingled the crowds from ev'ry region brought,And on the stage, in festal pomp array'dThe HOMAGE OF THE ARTS * we saw displayed.

　　(* The title of a lyric piece composed by Schiller in honour ofthe marriage of the hereditary Prince of Weimar to the PrincessMaria of Russia, and performed in 1804.)

　　When, lo! a fearful midnight sound I hear,

　　That with a dull and mournful echo rings.And can it be that of our friend so dear

　　It tells, to whom each wish so fondly clings?Shall death overcome a life that all revere?

　　How such a loss to all confusion brings!How such a parting we must ever rue!The world is weeping,--shall not we weep too?

　　He was our own! How social, yet how great

　　Seem'd in the light of day his noble mind!How was his nature, pleasing yet sedate,

　　Now for glad converse joyously incline,Then swiftly changing, spirit-fraught, elate,

　　Life's plan with deep-felt meaning it design'd,Fruitful alike in counsel and in deed!This have we proved, this tasted, in our need.

　　He was our own! O may that thought so blest

　　Overcome the voice of wailing and of woeHe might have sought the Lasting, safe at rest

　　In harbour, when the tempest ceased to blow.Meanwhile his mighty spirit onward press'd

　　Where goodness, beauty, truth, for ever grow;And in his rear, in shadowy outline, layThe vulgar, which we all, alas, obey!

　　Now doth he deck the garden-turret fair

　　Where the stars' language first illuded his soul,As secretly yet clearly through the air

　　On the eterne, the living sense it stole;And to his own, and our great profit, there

　　Exchangeth he the seasons as they roll;Thus nobly doth he vanquish, with renown,The twilight and the night that weigh us down.

　　Brighter now glow'd his cheek, and still more bright.

　　With that unchanging, ever-youthful glow,--That courage which overcomes, in hard-fought fight,

　　Sooner or later, ev'ry earthly foe--That faith which, soaring to the realms of light,

　　Now boldly Presseth on, now bendeth low,So that the good may work, wax, thrive amain,So that the day the noble may attain.

　　Yet, though so skill'd, of such transcendent worth,

　　This boarded scaffold doth he not despise;The fate that on its axis turns the earth

　　From day to night, here shows he to our eyes,Raising, through many a work of glorious birth,

　　Art and the artist's fame up tow'rd the skies.He fills with blossoms of the noblest strife,With life itself, this effigy of life.

　　His giant-step, as ye full surely knew,

　　Measured the circle of the will and deed,Each country's changing thoughts and morals too,

　　The darksome book with clearness could he read;Yet how he, breathless 'midst his friends so true,

　　Despaired in sorrow, scarce from pain was freed,--All this have we, in sadly happy years,For he was ours, bewailed with feeling tears.

　　When from the agonizing weight of grief

　　He raised his eyes upon the world again,We show'd him how his thoughts might find relief

　　From the uncertain present's heavy chain,Gave his fresh-kindled mind a respite brief,

　　With kindly skill beguiling ev'ry pain,And e'en at eve, when setting was his sun,From his wan cheeks a gentle smile we won.

　　Full early had he read the stern decree,

　　Sorrow and death to him, alas, were known;Ofttimes recovering, now departed he,--

　　Dread tidings, that our hearts had fear'd to own!Yet his transfigured being now can see

　　Itself, e'en here on earth, transfigured grown.What his own age reproved, and deem'd a crime,Hath been ennobled now by death and time.

　　And many a soul that with him strove in fight,

　　And his great merit grudged to recognise,Now feels the impress of his wondrous might,

　　And in his magic fetters gladly lies;E'en to the highest bath he winged his flight,

　　In close communion link'd with all we prize.Extol him then! What mortals while they liveBut half receive, posterity shall give.

　　Thus is he left us, who so long ago,--

　　Ten years, alas, already!--turn'd from earth;We all, to our great joy, his precepts know,

　　Oh may the world confess their priceless worth!In swelling tide tow'rd every region flow

　　The thoughts that were his own peculiar birth;He gleams like some departing meteor bright,Combining, with his own, eternal light.-----

　　L'ENVOl.

　　-----Now, gentle reader, is our journey ended,

　　Mute is our minstrel, silent is our song;Sweet the bard's voice whose strains our course attended,

　　Pleasant the paths he guided us along.Now must we part,--Oh word all full of sadness,Changing to pensive retrospect our gladness!

　　Reader, farewell! we part perchance for ever,

　　Scarce may I hope to meet with thee again;But e'en though fate our fellowship may sever,

　　Reader, will aught to mark that tie remain?Yes! there is left one sad sweet bond of union,--Sorrow at parting links us in communion.

　　But of the twain, the greater is my sorrow,--

　　Reader, and why?--Bethink thee of the sun,How, when he sets, he waiteth for the morrow,

　　Proudly once more his giant-race to run,--Yet, e'en when set, a glow behind him leaving,Gladdening the spirit, which had else been grieving.

　　Thus mayst thou feel, for thou to GOETHE only

　　Baldest farewell, nor camest aught for me.Twofold my parting, leaving me all lonely,--

　　I now must part from GOETHE and from thee,Parting at once from comrade and from leader,--Farewell, great minstrel! farewell, gentle reader!

　　Hush'd is the harp, its music sunk in slumbers,Memory alone can waken now its numbers.

　　End　　THE FIRST DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS CONTAINED, HOW HARD A THING IT IS, TO DISTINGUISH

　　GOODNESSE FROM HYPOCRISIE; AND HOW (UNDER THE SHADOW OF HOLINESSE)

　　THE WICKEDNESSE OF ONE MAN, MAY DECEIVE MANY

　　Messire Chappelet du Prat, by making a false confession, beguyledan holy Religious man, and after dyed. And having (during his lifetime) bene a very bad man, at his death, was reputed for a saint,and called S. Chappelet.

　　It is a matter most convenient (deare Ladies) that a man ought tobegin whatsoever he doth, in the great and glorious name of him, whowas the Creator of all things. Wherefore, seeing that I am the manappointed, to begin this your invention of discoursing Novelties: Iintend to begin also with one of his wonderfull workes. To the end,that this being heard, our hope may remaine on him, as the thing onelypermanent, and his name for ever to be praised by us. Now, as there isnothing more certaine, but that even as temporall things are mortalland transitory, so are they both in and out of themselves, full ofsorrow, paine, and anguish, and subjected to infinite dangers: So inthe same manner, we live mingled among them, seeming as part ofthem, and cannot (without some error) continue or defend our selves,if God by his especiall grace and favour, give us not strength andgood understanding. Which power we may not beleeve, that either itdescendeth to us, or liveth in us, by any merites of our owne; butof his onely most gracious benignity. Mooved neverthelesse andentreated by the intercessions of them, who were (as we are)mortals; and having diligently observed his commandements, are nowwith him in eternall blessednes. To whom (as to advocates andprocurators, informed by the experience of our frailty) wee are not topresent our prayers in the presence of so great a Judge; but onelyto himselfe, for the obtaining of all such things as his wisedomeknoweth to be most expedient for us. And well may we credit, thathis goodnesse is more fully enclined towards us, in his continuallbounty and liberality; then the subtilty of mortall eye, can reachinto the secret of so divine a thought: and sometimes therefore we maybe beguiled in opinion, by electing such and such as our intercessorsbefore his high Majesty, who perhaps are farre off from him, or driveninto perpetuall exile, as unworthy to appeare in so glorious apresence. For he, from whom nothing can be hidden, more regardeththe sincerity of him that prayeth, then ignorant devotion, committedto the trust of a heedlesse intercessor; and such prayers have alwaiesgracious acceptation in his sight. As manifestly will appeare, bythe Novell which I intend to relate; manifestly (I say) not as inthe judgement of God, but according to the apprehension of men.

　　There was one named, Musciatto Francesi, who from beeing a most richand great Merchant in France, was become a Knight, and preparing togoe into Tuscany, with Mounsieur Charles without Land, Brother tothe King of France (who was desired and incited to come thither byPope Boniface) found his affaires greatly intricated heere and there(as oftentimes the matters of Merchants fall out to bee) and that veryhardly hee should sodainly unintangle them, without referring thecharge of them to divers persons. And for all he tooke indifferentgood order, onely he remained doubtfull, whom he might sufficientlyleave, to recover his debts among many Burgundians. And the rather washis care the more heerein, because he knew the Burgundians to bepeople of badde nature, rioters, brablers, full of calumny, andwithout any faithfulnesse: so that he could not bethinke himselfe ofany man (how wicked soever he was) in whom he might repose trust tomeete with their lewdnesse. Having a long while examined histhoughts upon this point, at last hee remembred one Master Chappeletdu Prat, who ofttimes had resorted to his house in Paris. Andbecause he was a man of little stature, yet handsome enough, theFrench not knowing what this word Chappelet might meane, esteeminghe should be called rather (in their tongue) Chappell; imagined,that in regard of his small stature, they termed him Chappelet, andnot Chappell, and so by the name of Chappelet he was every whereknown, and by few or none acknowledged for Chappell.

　　This Master Chappelet, was of so good and commendable life; that,being a Notarie, he held it in high disdaine, that any of hisContractes (although he made but few) should be found withoutfalshoode. And looke how many soever hee dealt withall, he would beurged and required thereto, offering them his paines and travailefor nothing, but to bee requited otherwise then by money; whichprooved to bee his much larger recompencing, and returned to him thefarre greater benefit. Hee tooke the onely pleasure of the world, tobeare false witnesse, if hee were thereto entreated, and(oftentimes) when hee was not requested at all. Likewise because inthose times, great trust and beleefe was given to an oath, he makingno care or conscience to be perjured: greatly advantaged himselfe byLaw suites, in regard that many matters relyed upon his oath, anddelivering the truth according to his knowledge.

　　He delighted (beyond measure) and addicted his best studies, tocause enmities and scandals betweene kindred and friends, or any otherpersons, agreeing well together; and the more mischiefe he couldprocure in this kind, so much the more pleasure and delight tooke hetherein. If he were called to kill any one, or to do any othervillanous deede, he never would make deniall, but go to it verywillingly; and divers times it was well knowen, that many were cruellybeaten, ye slaine by his hands. Hee was a most horrible blasphemerof God and his Saints, upon the very least occasion, as being moreaddicted to choller, then any other man could be. Never would hefrequent the Church, but basely contemned it, with the Sacramentsand religious rites therein administred, accounting them for vileand unprofitable things: but very voluntarily would visit Tavernes,and other places of dishonest accesse, which were continually pleasingunto him, to satisfie his lust and inordinate lubricitie. Hee wouldsteale both in publike and private, even with such a conscience, as ifit were given to him by nature so to do. He was a great glutton anda drunkarde, even he was not able to take any more: being also acontinuall gamester, and carrier of false Dice, to cheate with themthe very best Friends he had.

　　But why do I waste time in such extent of words? When it may sufficeto say, that never was there a worse man borne; whose wickednessewas for long time supported, by the favour, power, and Authoritie ofMonsieur Musciatto, for whose sake many wrongs and injuries werepatiently endured, as well by private persons (whom hee would abusenotoriously) as others of the Court, betweene whom he made nodifference at all in his vile dealing. This Master Chappelet, beingthus remembred by Musciatto (who very well knew his life andbehaviour) he perfectly perswaded himselfe, that this was a man apt inall respects, to meete with the treachery of the Burgundians:whereupon, having sent for him, thus he beganne.

　　Chappelet, thou knowest how I am wholly to retreate my selfe fromhence, and having some affaires among the Burgundians, men full ofwickednesse and deceite; I can bethinke my selfe of no meeter a manthen Chappelet, to recover such debts as are due to mee among them.And because it falleth out so well, that thou art not now hinderedby any other businesse; if thou wilt undergoe this office for me, Iwill procure thee favourable Letters from the Court, and give thee areasonable portion in all thou recoverest. Master Chappelet, seeinghimselfe idle, and greedy after worldly goods, considering thatMounsieur Musciatto (who had beene alwayes his best buckler) was nowto depart from thence, without any dreaming on the matter, andconstrained thereto (as it were) by necessity, set downe hisresolution, and answered, that hee would gladly doe it.

　　Having made their agreement together, and received from Musciattohis expresse procuration, and also the Kings gracious Letters; afterthat Musciatto was gone on his journey, Master Chappelet went toDijon, where he was unknowne (well-neere) of any. And there (quitefrom his naturall disposition) he beganne benignely and graciously, inrecovering the debts due; which course he tooke the rather, becausethey should have a further feeling of him in the end. Being lodgedin the house of two Florentine brethren, that living on their moniesusance; and (for Mounsieur Musciattoes sake) using him with honour andrespect: it fortuned that he fell sicke, and the two brethren sent forPhysitions to attend him, allowing their servants to be diligent abouthim, making no spare of any thing, which gave the best likelyhood ofrestoring his health. But all their paines proved to no purpose,because he (honest man) being now growne aged, and having lived allhis life time very disorderly, fell day by day (according to thePhysicions judgement) from bad to worse, as no other way appearedbut death, whereat the brethren greatly grieved.

　　Upon a day, neere to the Chamber where the sicke man lay, theyentred into this communication. What shall we doe (quoth the one tothe other) with this man? We are much hindered by him: for to send himaway (sicke as he is) we shall be greatly blamed thereby, and itwill be a manifest note of our weake wisedome; the people knowing thatfirst of all we gave him entertainement, and have allowed him honestphysicall attendance, and he not having any way injuried or offendedus, to let him be suddenly expulsed our house (sicke to death as heis) it can be no way for our credit.

　　On the other side, we are to consider also, that hee hath bin sobadde a man, as he will not now make any confession thereof, neitherreceive the blessed Sacrament of the Church, and dying so withoutconfession; there is no Church that will accept his body, but itmust be buried in prophane ground, like to a Dogge. And yet if heewould confesse himselfe, his sinnes are so many and monstrous, asthe like case also may happen, because there is not any Priest orReligious person, that can or will absolve him. And being notabsolved, he must be cast into some ditch or pit, and then thepeople of the Towne, as well in regard of the account we carryheere, (which to them appeareth so little pleasing, as we are dailypursued with their worst words) as also coveting our spoile andoverthrow, upon this accident will cry out and mutiny against us;Behold these Lombard dogs, which are not to be received into theChurch, why should we suffer them to live heere among us? In furiousmadnesse will they come upon us, and our house, where (peradventure)not contended with robbing us of our goods, our lives will remainein their mercy and danger; so that, in what sort soever it happen,this mans dying here, must needs be banefull to us.

　　Master Chappelet, who (as we have formerly saide) was lodged neereto the place where they thus conferred, having a subtle attention(as oftentimes we see sicke persons to be possessed withall) heard allthese speeches spoken of him, and causing them to bee called unto him,thus hee spake.

　　I would not have you to be any way doubtfull of me; neither that youshould receive the least damage by me: I have heard what you havesaid, and am certaine, that it will happen according to your words, ifmatters should fall out as you conceite; but I am minded to dealeotherwise. I have committed so many offences against our Lord God,in the whole current of my life; that now I intend one action at thehoure of my death, which I trust will make amends for all. Procuretherefore, I pray you, that the most holy and religious man that is tobe found (if there bee any one at all) may come unto me, and referrethe case then to me, for I will deale in such sort for you and myselfe, that all shall be well, and you no way discontented.

　　The two Brethren, although they had no great hope in his speeches,went yet to a Monastery of Gray-Friars, and requested; that some oneholy and learned man, might come to heare the confession of a Lombard,that lay very weake and sicke in their house. And one was granted untothem, being an aged religious Frier, a great read master in the sacredScripture, a very venerable person, who being of good and sanctifiedlife, all the Citizens held him in great respect and esteeme, and onhee went with them to their house. When he was come up into theChamber where Master Chappelet lay, and being there seated downe byhim; he beganne first to comfort him very lovingly, demanding alsoof him, how many times he had bin at confession? Whereto MasterChappelet (who never had bin shrived in all his life time) thusreplied.

　　Holy Father, I alwayes used (as a common custome) to bee confessedonce (at the least) every weeke, albeit sometimes much more often; buttrue it is, that being falne into this sicknesse, now eight daiessince I have not beene confest, so violent hath bene the extremityof my weaknesse. My sonne (answered the good old man) thou hast donewell, and so keep thee still hereafter in that minde: but I plainlyperceive, seeing thou hast so often confessed thy selfe, that Ishall take the lesse labour in urging questions to thee.

　　Master Chappelet replyed; Say not so good Father, for albeit Ihave bene so oftentimes confessed, yet am I willing now to make agenerall confession, even of all sinnes comming to my remembrance,from the very day of my birth, until this instant houre of myshrift. And therefore I entreat you (holy Father) to make a particulardemand of everie thing, even as if I had never bene confessed atall, and to make no respect of my sicknesse: for I had rather beoffensive to mine owne flesh, then by favoring or allowing it ease, tohazard the perdition of my soule, which my Redeemer bought with soprecious a price.

　　These words were highly pleasing to the holy Friar, and seemed tohim as an argument of a good conscience: Wherefore, after hee had muchcommended this forwardnesse in him, he began to demand of him if hehad never offended with any Woman? Whereunto master Chappelet(breathing forth a great sigh) answered.

　　Holy Father, I am halfe ashamed to tell you the truth in thiscase, as fearing least I should sinne in vaine-glory. Whereto theConfessor replyed; Speake boldly sonne, and feare not, for intelling the truth, bee it in confession or otherwise, a man cannever sinne. Then sayde Maister Chappelet, Father, seeing you giveme so good an assurance, I will resolve you faithfully heerein. I amso true a Virgin-man in this matter, even as when I issued forth of mymothers Wombe. O sonne (quoth the Friar) how happy and blessed ofGod art thou? Well hast thou lived, and therein hast thou not meanlymerited, having had so much libertie to doe the contrary if thouwouldest, wherein verie few of us can so answer for our selves.

　　Afterward, he demanded of him, how much displeasing to God hee hadbeene in the sinne of Gluttony? When (sighing againe greatly) heeanswered: Too much, and too often, good Father. For, over and besidethe Fasts of our Lent season, which everie yeare ought to bee duelyobserved by devout people, I brought my selfe to such a customarieuse, that I could fast three dayes in every Weeke, with Bread andWater. But indeede (holy Father) I confesse, that I have drunkewater with such a pleasing appetite and delight (especially inpraying, or walking on pilgrimages) even as greedy drunkards doe, indrinking good Wine. And many times I have desired such Sallades ofsmall hearbes, as Women do gather abroad in the open fields, andfeeding onely upon them, without coveting after any other kinde ofsustenance, hath seemed much more pleasing to me, then I thought toagree with the nature of Fasting, especially, when as it swervethfrom devotion, or is not done as it ought to bee.Sonne, Sonne, replied the Confessour, these sinnes are naturall,and very light, and therefore I would not have thee to charge thyconscience with them, more then is needfull. It happeneth to every man(how holy soever he be) that after he hath fasted overlong, feedingwill be welcome to him, and drinking good drinke after his travaile. OSir, (said Maister Chappelet) never tell me this to comfort me, forwell you know, and I am not ignorant therein, that such things asare done for the service of God, ought all to be performed purely, andwithout any blemish of the minde; what otherwise is done, savoureth ofsinne. The Friar being well contented with his words, said: It isnot amisse that thou understandest it in this manner, and thyconscience thus purely cleared, is no little comfort to me. But tellme now concerning Avarice, hast thou sinned therein, by desiringmore then was reasonable, or withholding from others, such things asthou oughtst not to detaine? Wherein Maister Chappelet answered.Good Father, I would not have you to imagine, because you see melodged heere in the house of two Usurers, that therefore I am of anysuch disposition. No truely Sir, I came hither to no other end, butonely to chastise and admonish them in friendly manner, to clensetheir mindes from such abhominable profit: And assuredly, I shouldhave prevailed therein, had not this violent sicknesse hindered mineintention. But understand (holy Father) that my parents left me a richman, and immediatly after my Fathers death, the greater part of hisgoods I gave away for Gods sake, and then, to sustaine mine owne life,and to helpe the poore members of Jesus Christ, I betooke my selfeto a meane estate of Merchandise, desiring none other then honestgaine thereby, and evermore whatsoever benefit came to me; Iimparted halfe thereof to the poore, converting mine owne smallportion about my necessary affaires, which that other part wouldscarcely serve to supply: yet alwayes God gave thereto such amercifull blessing, that my businesse dayly thrived more and more,arising still from good to better.

　　Well hast thou done therein good Sonne, said the Confessour: but howoftentimes hast thou beene angry? Oh Sir (said Maister Chappelet)therein I assure yee, I have often transgressed. And what man isable to forbeare it; beholding the dayly actions of men to be sodishonest? No care of keeping Gods Commandements, nor any feare of hisdreadfull judgements. Many times in a day, I have rather wished myselfe dead then living, beholding youth pursuing idle vanities, tosweare and forsweare themselves, tipling in Tavernes, and neverhaunting Churches; but rather affecting the worlds follies, then anysuch duties as they owe to God. Alas Sonne (quoth the Friar) this is agood and holy anger, and I can impose no penance on thee for it. Buttell me, hath not rage or furie at any time so over-ruled thee, asto commit murther or man-slaughter, or to speake evill of any man,or to doe any other such kinde of injurie? Oh Father (answered MaisterChappelet) you that seeme to be a man of God, how dare you use anysuch vile words? If I had had the very least thought, to doe anysuch act as you speake, doe you thinke that God would have suffered meto live? These are deeds of darknesse, fit for villaines and wickedlivers, of which hellish crew, when at any time I have happened tomeet with some one of them, I have said; God, God convert thee.

　　Worthy, and charitable words, replied the Friar: but tell meSonne, Didst thou ever beare false witnes against any man, or hastspoken falsly, or taken ought from any one, contrary to the will ofthe owner? Yes indeed Father, said Maister Chappelet, I have spokenill of another, because I have sometime seene one of my neighbors, whowith no meane shame of the world, would do nothing else but beat hiswife: and of him once I complained to the poore mans parents,saying, that he never did it but when he was overcome with drinke.Those were no ill words, quoth the Friar; but I remember you said,that you were a Merchant: Did you ever deceive any, as someMerchants use to doe? Truely Father, answered M. Chappelet, I thinkenot any, except one man, who one day brought me money which he owed mefor a certaine peece of cloath I sold him, and I put it into a pursewithout accounting it. About a moneth afterward, I found that therewere foure small pence more then was due to mee: and never happeningto meete with the man againe, after I had kept them the space of awhole yeare, I then gave them away unto foure poore people, for Godssake.

　　A small matter, said the Friar, and truly payed backe againe tothe owner, in bestowing them on the poore. Many other questions hedemanded of him, whereto still he answered in the same manner. Butbefore he proceeded to absolution, Master Chappelet spake thus: I haveyet one sinne more, which I have not revealed to you: when being urgedby the Friar to confesse it, he said. I remember, that I should affordone day in the weeke, to cleanse the house of my soule, for betterentertainement to my Lord and Saviour, and yet I have done no suchreverence to the Sunday or Sabbath, as I ought to have done. A smallfault Sonne, replyed the Friar. O no (quoth Master Chappelet)doe not terme it a small fault, because Sunday being a holy day,is highly to be reverenced: for as on that day, our blessed Lord arosefrom death to life. But (quoth the Confessor) hast thou done nothingelse on that day? Yes, said he, being forgetfull of my selfe, once Idid spet in Gods Church. The Friar smiling, said: Alas Sonne, thatis a matter of no moment; for wee that are Religious persons, doeuse to spet there every day. The more is your shame, answered MasterChappelet, for no place ought to bee kept more pure and cleane thenthe sacred Temple, wherein our daily sacrifices are offered up to God.

　　In this manner he held on an houre and more, uttering the liketransgressions as these; and at last began to sigh verypassionately, and to shed a few teares, as one that was skilfullenough in such dissembling pranks: whereat the Confessor being muchmooved, saide: Alas Sonne, what aylest thou? Oh Father (quothChappelet) there remaineth yet one sinne more upon my conscience,wherof I never at any time made confession, so shamefull itappeareth to mee to disclose it; and I am partly perswaded, that Godwill never pardon me for that sinne. How now Sonne? said the Friar,never say so; for if all the sinnes that ever were committed by men,or shall be committed so long as the World endureth, were onely in oneman, and he repenting them, and being so contrite for them, as I seethou art; the grace and mercy of God is so great, that upon penitentconfession, he will freely pardon him, and therefore spare not tospeake it boldly. Alas Father (said Chappelet, still in pretendedweeping) this sinne of mine is so great, that I can hardly beleeve (ifyour earnest prayers do not assist me) that ever I shall obtaineremission for it. Speake it Sonne, said the Friar, and feare not, Ipromise that I will pray to God for thee.

　　Master Chappelet still wept and sighed, and continued silent,notwithstanding all the Confessors comfortable perswasions; butafter hee had helde him a long while in suspence, breathing forth asighe, even as if his very heart would have broken, he saide; HolyFather, seeing you promise to pray to God for me, I will reveale it toyou: Know then, that when I was a little boy, I did once curse myMother; which he had no sooner spoken, but he wrung his hands, andgreeved extraordinarily. Oh good Son, saide the Friar: doth that seemeso great a sinne to thee? Why, men doe daily blaspheme our Lord God,and yet neverthelesse, upon their hearty repentance, he is alwayesready to forgive them; and wilt not thou beleeve to obtaine remission,for a sinne so ignorantly committed? Weepe no more deare Sonne, butcomfort thy selfe and rest resolved, that if thou wert one of them,who nayled our blessed Saviour to his Crosse; yet being so trulyrepentant, as I see thou art, he would freely forgive thee. Say you soFather? quoth Chappelet. What mine owne deare Mother? that bare mein her wombe nine moneths, day and night, and afterwards fed me withher breasts a thousand times, can I be pardoned for cursing her? Ohno, it is too haynous a sinne, and except you pray to God veryinstantly for me, he will not forgive me.

　　When the religious man perceived, that nothing more was to beeconfessed by Master Chappelet; he gave him absolution, and his ownebenediction beside, reputing him to be a most holy man, as verilybeleeving all that hee had said. And who would not have done the like,hearing a man to speake in this manner, and being upon the verypoint of death? Afterward, he saide unto him, Master Chappelet, byGods grace you may be soone restored to health, but if it so come topasse, that God doe take your blessed and well disposed soule to hismercy, will it please you to have your body buried in our Convent?Whereto Master Chappelet answered; I thanke you Father for your goodmotion, and sorry should I be, if my friends did bury me any whereelse, because you have promised to pray to God for me; and beside, Ihave alwayes carried a religious devotion to your Order. Wherefore,I beseech you, so soone as you are come home to your Convent, prevaileso much by your good meanes, that the holy Eucharist, consecrated thismorning on your high Altar, may be brought unto me: for although Iconfesse my selfe utterly unworthy, yet I purpose (by your reverendpermission) to receive it, as also your holy and latest unction, tothis ende, that having lived a greevous sinner, I may yet (at thelast) die a Christian. These words were pleasing to the good olde man,and he caused every thing to be performed, according as MasterChappelet had requested.

　　The two Brethren, who much doubted the dissembling of Chappelet,being both in a small partition, which sundered the sicke mans Chamberfrom theirs, heard and understood the passage of all, betweene him andthe ghostly Father, being many times scarcely able to refraine fromlaughter, at the fraudulent course of his confession. And often theysaid within themselves, What manner of man is this, whom neitherage, sickenesse, nor terror of death so neere approaching, andsensible to his owne soule, nor that which is much more, God, beforewhose judgement he knowes not how soone he shall appeare, or else besent to a more fearefull place; none of these can alter his wickeddisposition, but that he will needes die according as he hath lived?Notwithstanding, seeing he had so ordered the matter, that he hadburiall freely allowed him, they cared for no more.

　　After that Chappelet had received the Communion, and the otherCeremonies appointed for him; weakenesse encreasing on him more andmore, the very same day of his goodly confession, he died (not longafter) towards the evening. Whereupon the two Brethren tooke order,that all needefull things should be in a readinesse, to have himburied honourably; sending to acquaint the Fathers of the Conventtherewith, that they might come to say their Vigilles, according toprecedent custome, and then on the morrow to fetch the body. Thehonest Friar that had confessed him, hearing he was dead, went tothe Prior of the Convent, and by sound of the house Bell, caused allthe Brethren to assemble together, giving them credibly to understand,that Master Chappelet was a very holy man, as appeared by all theparts of his confession, and made no doubt, but that many miracleswould be wrought by his sanctified body, perswading them to fetch itthither with all devoute solemnity and reverence: whereto the Prior,and all the credulous Brethren presently condiscended very gladly.

　　When night was come, they went all to visit the dead body ofMaster Chappelet, where they used an especiall and solemne Vigill; andon the morrow, apparelled in their richest Coapes and Vestiments, withbookes in their hands, and the Crosse borne before them, singing inthe forme of a very devoute procession, they brought the bodypompeously into their Church, accompanied with all the people of theTowne, both men and women. The Father Confessor, ascending up into thePulpit, preached wonderfull things of him, and the rare holinesse ofhis life; his fastes, his virginity, simplicity, innocency, and truesanctity, recounting also (among other especiall observations) whatChappelet had confessed, as this most great and greevous sinne, andhow hardly he could be perswaded, that God would grant him pardonfor it. Whereby he tooke occasion to reprove the people thenpresent, saying; And you (accursed of God) for the verie least andtrifling matter hapning, will not spare to blaspheme God, hisblessed Mother, and the whole Court of heavenly Paradise: Oh, takeexample by this singular man, this Saint-like man, nay, a very Saintindeede.

　　Many additions more he made, concerning his faithfulnesse, truth,and integrity; so that, by the vehement asseveration of his words(whereto all the people there present gave credible beleefe) heprovoked them unto such zeale and earnest devotion; that the Sermonwas no sooner ended, but (in mighty crowds and throngs) they pressedabout the Biere, kissing his hands and feete, and all the garmentsabout him were torne in peeces, as precious Reliques of so holy aperson, and happy they thought themselves, that could get the smallestpeece or shred of any thing that came neere to his body: and thus theycontinued all the day, the body lying still open, to be visited inthis manner.

　　When night was come, they buried him in a goodly Marble tombe,erected in a faire Chappell purposely; and for many dayes afterfollowing, it was most strange to see, how the people of the Countrycame thither on heapes, with holy Candles and other offerings, withImages of waxe fastened to the Tombe, in signe of Sacred and solemneVowes, to this new created Saint. And so farre was spread the fame andrenowne of his sanctity, devotion, and integrity of life, maintainedconstantly by the Fathers of the Convent; that if any one fell sickein neede, distresse, or adversity, they would make their Vowes to noother Saint but him: naming him (as yet to this day they do) SaintChappelet, affirming upon their Oathes, that infinite miracles werethere daily performed by him, and especially on such, as came indevotion to visit his shrine.

　　In this manner lived and died Master Chappelet du Prat, who beforehe became a Saint, was as you have heard: and I will not deny it to beimpossible, but that he may bee at rest among other blessed bodies.For although he lived lewdly and wickedly, yet such might be hiscontrition in the latest extreamity, that (questionlesse) he mightfinde mercie. But, because such things remaine unknowne to us, andspeaking by outward appearance, vulgar judgement will censureotherwise of him, and thinke him to be rather in perdition, then in soblessed a place as Paradice. But referring that to the Omnipotentsappointment, whose clemencie hath alwayes beene so great to us, thathe regards not our errors, but the integrity of our Faith, making(by meanes of our continuall Mediator) of an open enemy, a convertedsonne and servant. And as I began in his name, so will I conclude,desiring that it may evermore be had in due reverence, and referrewe our selves thereto in all our necessities, with this setledassurance, that he is alwayes ready to heare us. And so he ceased.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS CONTAINED AND EXPRESSED, THE LIBERALITY AND

　　GOODNESSE OF GOD, EXTENDED TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH

　　Abraham a Jew, being admonished or advised by a friend of his,named Jehannot de Chevigny, travailed from Paris unto Rome: Andbeholding there the wicked behaviour of men in the Church, returnedbacke to Paris againe, where yet (neverthelesse) he became aChristian.

　　The Novell recited by Pamphilus, was highly pleasing to the company,and much commended by the Ladies: and after it had beene diligentlyobserved among them, the Queene commanded Madam Neiphila (who wasseated neerest to Pamphilus) that, in relating another of hers, sheshould follow on in the pastime thus begun. She being no lessegracious in countenance, then merrily disposed; made answere, thatshee would obey her charge, and began in this manner.

　　Pamphilus hath declared to us, by his Tale, how the goodnesse of Godregardeth not our errors, when they proceede from things which weecannot discerne. And I intend to approove by mine, what argument ofinfallible truth, the same benignity delivereth of it selfe, byenduring patiently the faults of them, that (both in word and worke)should declare unfaigned testimony of such gracious goodnesse, and notto live so dissolutely as they doe. To the end, that othersillumined by their light of life, may beleeve with the strongerconstancy of minde.

　　As I have heeretofore heard (Gracious Ladies) there lived awealthy Marchant in Paris, being a Mercer, or seller of Silkes,named Jehannot de Chevigny, a man of faithfull, honest, and uprightdealing; who held great affection and friendship with a very rich Jew,named Abraham, that was a Merchant also, and a man of very directconversation. Jehannot well noting the honesty and loyall dealing ofthis Jew, began to have a Religious kinde of compassion in hissoule, much pittying that a man so good in behaviour, so wise anddiscreete in all his actions, should be in danger of perditionthorow want of Faith. In which regard, lovingly he began to intreatehim, that he would leave the errors of his Jewish beleefe, andfollow the truth of Christianity, which he evidently saw (as beinggood and holy) daily to prosper and enlarge it selfe, whereas on thecontrary, his profession decreased, and grew to nothing.

　　The Jew made answer, that he beleeved nothing to be so good andholy, as the Jewish Religion, and having beene borne therein, thereinalso he purposed to live and dye, no matter whatsoever being able toremove him from that resolution. For all this stiffe deniall,Jehannot would not so give him over; but pursued him still day byday, reitterating continually his former speeches to him: deliveringinfinite excellent and pregnant reasons, that Merchants themselveswere not ignorant, how farre the Christian faith excelled the Jewishfalshoods. And albeit the Jew was a very learned man in his owneLaw, yet notwithstanding the intire amity he bare to Jehannot, or(perhaps) his words fortified by the blessed Spirit, were soprevailant with him, that the Jew felt a pleasing apprehension inthem, though as yet his obstinacie stoode farre off from Conversion.But as he thus continued strong in opinion, so Jehannot lefte nothourely to labour him: insomuch, that the Jew being conquered bysuch earnest and continuall importunity, one day spake to Jehannot,saying.

　　My worthy friend Jehannot, thou art extremely desirous, that Ishould convert to Christianitie, and I am well contented to doe it;onely upon this condition: That first I wil journey to Rome, to seehim whom thou sayest, is Gods general Vicar here on earth, and toconsider on the course of his life and manners, and likewise of hisColledge of Cardinals. If he and they doe appeare such men to mee,as thy speeches affirme them to be, and thereby I may comprehendthat thy Faith and Religion is better then mine, as with no meanepaines thou endevourest to perswade mee, I will become a Christianas thou art: but if I finde it otherwise, I will continue as I am, aJew.

　　Jehannot hearing these words, became exceeding sorrowfull, and saydwithin himselfe; I have lost all the paines which I did thinke to bewell employed, as hoping to have this man converted heere. For, ifhe go to the Court of Rome, and behold there the wickednes of thePriests lives, farewell all hope in me, of ever seeing him to become aChristian. But rather, were he already a Christian, without allquestion he would turne a Jew. And so going neerer to Abraham, hesaid. Alas my loving friend, why shouldst thou undertake such atedious travel, and so great a charge, as thy journey from hence toRome will cost thee? Consider, that to a rich man (as thou art)travaile by land or Sea is full of infinite dangers. Doest thou notthinke, that here are Religious men enow, who wil gladly bestowBaptisme upon thee? To mee therefore it plainely appeareth, thatsuch a voyage is to no purpose. If thou standest upon any doubt orscruple, concerning the faith whereto I wish thee; where canst thoudesire conference with greater Doctours, or men more learned in allrespects, then this famous Cittie doth affoord thee, to resolve theein any questionable case? Thou must thinke, that the Prelates are suchthere, as heere thou seest them to be, and yet they must needes bein much better condition at Rome, because they are neere to theprincipall Pastor. And therefore, if thou wilt credit my counsell,reserve this journey to some time more convenient, when the Jubilee ofgenerall Pardon happeneth, and then (perchance) I will beare theecompany, and go along with thee as in vowed Pilgrimage.

　　Whereto the Jew replyed: I beleeve Jehannot that all which thou hastsaid, may be so. But, to make short with thee, I am fully determined(if thou wouldst have me a Christian, as thou instantly urgest me tobee) to goe thither, for otherwise, I will continue as I am.Jehannot perceyving his setled purpose, said: Goe then in Gods name.But perswaded himselfe, that hee would never become a Christian, afterhe had once seene the Court of Rome: neverthelesse, he counted hislabour not altogither lost, in regard he bestowed it to a good end,and honest intentions are to be commended.

　　The Jew mounted on horse-backe, and made no lingering in his journeyto Rome; where being arrived, he was very honourably entertained byother Jewes dwelling in Rome. And during the time of his abiding there(without revealing to any one the reason of his comming thither)very heedfully he observed the maner of the Popes life, of theCardinals, Prelates, and all the Courtiers. And being a man verydiscreet and judicious, hee apparantly perceived, both by his owneeye, and further information of friends; that from the highest tothe lowest (without any restraint, remorse of conscience, shame, orfeare of punishment) all sinned in abhominable luxurie, and notnaturally onely, but in foule Sodomie, so that the credite ofStrumpets and Boyes was not small, and yet might be too easilyobtayned. Moreover, drunkards, belly-Gods, and servants of the paunch,more then of any thing else (even like brutish beasts after theirluxury) were every where to be met withall. And upon furtherobservation, hee saw all men so covetous and greedie of Coyne, thatevery thing was bought and solde for ready money, not onely theblood of men, but (in plaine termes) the faith of Christians, yea, andmatters of divinest qualities, how, or to whomsoever appertaining,were it for Sacrifices or Benefices, whereof was made no meanmerchandize, and more Brokers were there to be found (then in Parisattending upon all Trades) of manifest Symonie, under the nice name ofNegotiation, and for gluttony, not sustentation: even as if God hadnot knowne the signification of vocables, nor the intentions of wickedhearts, but would suffer himselfe to bee deceived by the outward namesof things, as wretched men commonly use to doe.

　　These things, and many more (fitter for silence, then forpublication) were so deepely displeasing to the Jew, being a mostsober and modest man; that he had soone seene enough, resolving on hisreturne to Paris, which very speedily he performed. And whenJehannot heard of his arrivall, crediting much rather other newes fromhim, then ever to see him a converted Christian; he went to welcomehim, and kindly they feasted one another. After some few dayes ofresting, Jehannot demanded of him; what he thought of our holyFather the Pope and his Cardinals, and generally of all the otherCourtiers? Whereto the Jew readily answered; It is strange Jehannot,that God should give them so much as he doth. For I will truely tellthee, that if I had beene able to consider all those things, whichthere I have both heard and seene: I could then have resolved myselfe, never to have found in any Priest, either sanctity, devotion,good worke, example of honest life, or any good thing else beside. Butif a man desire to see luxury, avarice, gluttony, and such wickedthings, yea, worse, if worse may be, and held in generall estimationof all men; let him but goe to Rome, which I thinke rather to be theforge of damnable actions, then any way leaning to grace or goodnesse.And, for ought I could perceive, me thinkes your chiefe Pastour, and(consequently) all the rest of his dependants, doe strive so much asthey may (with all their engine arte and endevour) to bring tonothing, or else to banish quite out of the world, Christian Religion,whereof they should be the support and foundation.

　　But because I perceive, that their wicked intent will never cometo passe, but contrariwise, that your faith enlargeth it selfe,shining every day much more cleare and splendant: I gather therebyevidently, that the blessed Spirit is the true ground and defencethereof, as being more true and holy then any other. In which respect,whereas I stood stiffe and obstinate against the good admonitions, andnever minded to become a Christian: now I freely open my heart untothee, that nothing in the world can or shall hinder me, but I willbe a Christian, as thou art. Let us therefore presently goe to theChurch, and there (according to the true custome of your holyfaiths) helpe me to be baptized.

　　Jehannot, who expected a farre contrary conclusion then this,hearing him speake it with such constancy; was the very gladdest manin the world, and went with him to the Church of Nostre Dame in Paris,where he requested the Priests there abiding, to bestow baptisme onAbraham, which they joyfully did, hearing him so earnestly to desireit. Jehannot was his Godfather, and named him John, and afterward,by learned Divines he was more fully instructed in the grounds ofour faith; wherein he grew of great understanding, and led a veryvertuous life.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　WHEREBY THE AUTHOR, APPROVING THE CHRISTIAN FAITH,

　　SHEWETH, HOW BENEFICIALL A SODAINE AND INGENIOUS ANSWERE

　　MAY FALL OUT TO BEE, ESPECIALLY WHEN A MAN FINDS HIMSELFE

　　IN SOME EVIDENT DANGER

　　Melchisedech a Jew, by recounting a Tale of three Rings, to thegreat Soldan, named Saladine, prevented a great danger which wasprepared for him.

　　Madame Neiphila having ended her Discourse, which was well allowedof by all the company; it pleased the Queene, that Madame Philomenashould next succeede in order, who thus began.

　　The Tale delivered by Neiphila, maketh mee remember a doubtfullcase, which sometime hapned to another Jew. And because that God,and the truth of his holy Faith, hath bene already very welldiscoursed on: it shall not seeme unfitting (in my poore opinion) todescend now into the accidents of men. Wherefore, I will relate amatter unto you, which being attentively heard and considered; maymake you much more circumspect, in answering to divers questions anddemands, then (perhaps) otherwise you would be. Consider then (mostwoorthy assembly) that like as folly or dulnesse, many times hathoverthrowne some men from place of eminencie, into most great andgreevous miseries: even so, discreet sense and good understanding,hath delivered many out of irksome perils, and seated them in safestsecurity. And to prove it true, that folly hath made many fall fromhigh authority, into poore and despised calamity; may be avouched byinfinite examples, which now were needelesse to remember: But, thatgood sense and able understanding, may proove to be the occasion ofgreat desolation, without happy prevention, I will declare unto you invery few words, and make it good according to my promise.

　　Saladine, was a man so powerfull and valiant, as not onely hisvery valour made him Soldan of Babylon, and also gave him many signallvictories, over Kings of the Sarrazens, and of Christians likewise.Having in divers Warres, and other magnificent employments, of hisowne, wasted all his treasure, and (by reason of some sodaine accidenthappening to him) standing in neede to use some great summe ofmoney, yet not readily knowing where, or how to procure it; heremembred a rich Jew named Melchisedech, that lent out money to use orinterest in the City of Alexandria. This man he imagined best ableto furnish him, if he could be won to do it willingly: but he wasknowne to be so gripple and miserable, that hardly any meanes woulddrawe him to it. In the end, constrained by necessity, and labouringhis wits for some apt device whereby he might have it: he concluded,though hee might not compell him to do it, yet by a practiseshadowed with good reason to ensnare him. And having sent for him,entertained him very familiarly in his Court, and sitting downe byhim, thus began.

　　Honest man, I have often heard it reported by many, that thou artvery skilfull, and in cases concerning God, thou goest beyond allother of these times: wherefore, I would gladly bee informed bythee, which of those three Lawes or Religions, thou takest to betruest; that of the Jew, the other of the Sarazen, or that of theChristian? The Jew, being a very wise man, plainely perceived, thatSaladine sought to entrap him in his answere, and so to raise somequarrell against him. For, if he commended any one of those Lawesabove the other, he knew that Saladine had what he aymed at.Wherefore, bethinking himselfe to shape such an answere, as might noway trouble or entangle him: summoning all his sences together, andconsidering, that dallying with the Soldane might redound to his nomeane danger, thus he replied.

　　My Lord, the question propounded by you, is faire and worthy, and toanswere my opinion truely thereof, doth necessarily require sometime of consideration, if it might stand with your liking to allow it:but if not, let me first make entrance to my reply, with a prettytale, and well worth the hearing. I have oftentimes heard it reported,that (long since) there was a very wealthy man, who (among otherprecious Jewels of his owne) had a goodly Ring of great valew; thebeauty and estimation whereof, made him earnestly desirous to leave itas a perpetuall memory and honour to his successors. Whereupon, hewilled and ordained, that he among his male children, with whom thisRing (being left by the Father) should be found in custody after hisdeath; hee and none other, was to bee reputed his heire, and to behonoured and reverenced by all the rest, as being the prime andworthiest person. That Sonne, to whom this Ring was left by him,kept the same course to his posterity, dealing (in all respects) ashis predecessor had done; so that (in short time) the Ring (fromhand to hand) had many owners by Legacie.

　　At length, came to the hand of one, who had three sonnes, all ofthem goodly and vertuous persons, and verie obedient to theirFather: in which regard, he affected them all equally, without anydifference or partiall respect. The custome of this Ring beingknowne to them, each one of them (coveting to beare esteeme abovethe other) desired (as hee could best make his meanes) his Father,that in regard he was now growne very old, he would leave that Ring tohim, whereby he should bee acknowledged for his heire. The good man,who loved no one of them more then the other, knew not how to make hischoise, nor to which of them he should leave the Ring: yet having pasthis promise to them severally, he studied by what meanes to satisfiethem all three. Wherefore, secretly having conferred with a curiousand excellent Goldsmith, hee caused two other Rings to bee made, soreally resembling the first made Ring, that himselfe (when he had themin his hand) could not distinguish which was the right one.

　　Lying upon his death-bed, and his Sonnes then plying him by theirbest opportunities, he gave to each of them a Ring. And they (afterhis death) presuming severally upon their right to the inheritance andhonor, grew to great contradiction and square: each man producing thenhis Ring, which were so truely all alike in resemblance, as no onecould know the right Ring from the other. And therefore, suite in Law,to distinguish the true heire to his Father, continued long time,and so it dooth yet to this very day. In like manner my good Lord,concerning those three Lawes given by God the Father, to three suchpeople as you have propounded: each of them do imagine that theyhave the heritage of God, and his true Law, and also duely to performehis Commandements; but which of them do so indeede, the question (asof the three Rings) is yet remaining.

　　Saladine well perceyving, that the Jew was too cunning to bee caughtin his snare, and had answered so well, that to doe him furtherviolence, would redound unto his perpetuall dishonour; resolved toreveale his neede and extremity, and try if hee would therein friendlysted him. Having disclosed the matter, and how he purposed to havedealt with him, if he had not returned so wise an answere; the Jewlent him so great a sum of money as hee demanded, and Saladine repayedit againe to him justly, giving him other great gifts beside:respecting him as his especiall friend, and maintaining him in veryhonourable condition, neere unto his owne person.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN MAY BEE NOTED, THAT SUCH MEN AS WILL REPROVE THOSE

　　ERROURS IN OTHERS, WHICH REMAINE IN THEMSELVES, COMMONLY ARE

　　THE AUTHORS OF THEIR OWNE REPREHENSION

　　A Monke having committed an offence, deserving to be very greevouslypunished, freed himselfe from the paine to be inflicted on him, bywittily reprehending his Abbot, with the very same fault.

　　So ceased Madame Philotnena, after the conclusion of her Tale:when Dioneus sitting next unto her, (without tarrying for any othercommand from the Queene, knowing by the order formerly begun, that heewas to follow in the same course) spake in this manner.

　　Gracious Ladies, if I faile not in understanding your generallintention, we are purposely assembled heere to tell Tales; andespecially such as may please our selves. In which respect, becausenothing shold be done disorderly, I hold it lawfull for every one(as our Queene decreed before her Dignity) to relate such aNoveltie, as in their owne judgement may cause most contentment.Wherefore having heard that by the good admonitions of Jehannot deChevigny, Abraham the Jew was advised to the salvation of his soule,and Melchisedech (by his witty understanding) defended his riches fromthe traines of Saladine: I now purpose to tell you in a few plainewords, without feare of receiving any reprehension, how cunningly aMonke compassed his deliverance, from a punishment intended towardshim.

　　There was in the Country of Lunigiana (which is not far distant fromour owne) a Monastery, which sometime was better furnished withholinesse and Religion, then now adayes they are: wherein lived (amongdivers other) a yong Novice Monke, whose hot and lusty disposition(being in the vigour of his yeeres) was such, as neither Fasts norprayers had any great power over him. It chanced on a fasting dayabout high noon, when all the other Monkes were asleep in theirDormitaries or Dorters, this frolicke Friar was walking alone in theirChurch, which stoode in a very solitarie place, where ruminating onmany matters by himselfe, hee espyed a prettie handsome Wench (someHusbandmans daughter in the Countrey, that had beene gatheringrootes and hearbes in the field) upon her knees before in Altar;whom he had no sooner seene, but immediately hee felt effeminatetemptations, and such as ill fitted with his profession.

　　Lascivious desire, and no religious devotion, made him draw neereher, and whether under shrift (the onely cloake to compasse carnalaffections) or some other as close conference to as pernitious andvile a purpose, I know not: but so farre he prevailed upon herfrailety, and such a bargaine passed betweene them, that from theChurch, he wonne her to his Chamber, before any person couldperceive it. Now, while this yong lusty Monke (transported withoverfond affection) was more carelesse of his dalliance, then heshould have bene: the Lord Abbot being newly arisen from sleepe, andwalking softly about the Cloyster, came to the Monkes Dorter doore,where hearing what noyse was made betweene them, and a femininevoyce more strange then hee was wont to heare; he layed his eare closeto the Chamber doore, and plainly perceived, that a woman waswithin. Wherewith being much moved, he intended sodainly to make himopen the doore; but (upon better consideration) hee conceyved it farremore fitting for him, to returne backe to his owne Chamber, andtarry till the Monke should come forth.

　　The Monke, though his delight with the Damosell was extraordinary,yet feare and suspition followed upon it; for, in the very height ofall his wantonnesse, he heard a soft treading about the doore. Andprying thorow a small crevice in the same dore, perceived apparantly,that the Abbot himselfe stood listening there, and could not beignorant but that the Maide was with him in the Chamber. As afterpleasure ensueth paine, for the veniall Monke knew well enough (thoughwanton heate would not let him heede it before) that most greevouspunishment must bee inflicted on him, which made him sad beyond allmeasure: Neverthelesse, without disclosing his dismay to the yongMaiden, he began to consider with himselfe on many meanes, wherebyto find out one that might best fit his turne. And suddenlyconceited an apt stratagem, which sorted to such effect as he wouldhave it: whereupon, seeming satisfied for that season, he tolde theDamosell, that (being carefull of her credit) as hee had brought herin unseene of any, so he would free her from thence againe, desiringher to tarrie there (without making any noyse at all) untill such timeas he returned to her.

　　Going forth of the chamber, and locking it fast with the key, hewent directly to the Lord Abbots lodging, and delivering him the saidekey (as every Monke used to doe the like, when he went abroade outof the Convent) setting a good countenance on the matter, boldlysaide; My Lord, I have not yet brought in all my part of the wood,which lieth ready cut downe in the Forrest; and having nowconvenient time to doe it, if you please to give me leave, I willgoe and fetch it. The Abbot perswading himselfe, that he had not beenediscovered by the Monke, and to be resolved more assuredly in theoffence committed; being not a little jocund of so happy anaccident, gladly tooke the key, and gave him leave to fetch the wood.

　　No sooner was he gone, but the Abbot beganne to consider withhimselfe, what he were best to doe in this case, either (in thepresence of all the other Monkes) to open the Chamber doore, that sothe offence being knowne to them all, they might have no occasion ofmurmuring against him, when he proceeded in the Monkes punishment;or rather should first understand of the Damosell her selfe, how,and in what manner shee was brought thither. Furthermore, heconsidered, that shee might be a woman of respect, or some such mansdaughter, as would not take it well, to have her disgraced beforeall the Monkes. Wherefore hee concluded, first to see (himselfe)what shee was, and then (afterward) to resolve upon the rest. So goingvery softly to the Chamber, and entring in, locked the doore fast withthe key, when the poore Damosell thinking it had beene the gallantyoung Monke; but finding it to be the Lord Abbot, shee fell on herknees weeping, as fearing now to receive publike shame, by beingbetrayed in this unkinde manner.

　　My Lord Abbot looking demurely on the Maide, and perceiving her tobe faire, feate, and lovely; felt immediately (although he was olde)no lesse spurring on to fleshly desires, then the young Monke beforehad done; whereupon he beganne to conferre thus privately withhimselfe. Why should I not take pleasure, when I may freely have it?Cares and molestations I endure every day, but sildome find suchdelights prepared for me. This is a delicate sweete young Damosell,and here is no eye that can discover me. If I can enduce her to doe asI would have her, I know no reason why I should gaine-say it. No mancan know it, or any tongue blaze it abroade; and sinne so concealed,is halfe pardoned. Such a faire fortune as this is, perhapshereafter will never befall me; and therefore I hold it wisedome, totake such a benefit when a man may enjoy it.

　　Upon this immodest meditation, and his purpose quite altered whichhe came for; he went neerer to her, and very kindly began to comforther, desiring her to forbeare weeping: and (by further insinuatingspeeches) acquainted her with his amorous intention. The Maide, whowas made neither of yron nor diamond, and seeking to prevent one shameby another, was easily wonne to the Abbots will, which caused him toembrace and kisse her often.

　　Our lusty young novice Monke, whom the Abbot imagined to bee gonefor wood, had hid himselfe aloft upon the roofe of the Dorter,where, when he saw the Abbot enter alone into the Chamber, he lost agreat part of his former feare, promising to himselfe a kinde ofperswasion, that somewhat would ensue to his better comfort; butwhen he beheld him lockt into the Chamber, then his hope grew toundoubted certainty. A little chincke or crevice favoured him, whereathe could both heare and see, whatsoever was done or spoken by them:so, when the Abbot thought hee had staide long enough with theDamosell, leaving her still there, and locking the doore fastagaine, hee returned thence to his owne Chamber.

　　Within some short while after, the Abbot knowing the Monke to bein the Convent, and supposing him to be lately returned with the wood,determined to reprove him sharpely, and to have him closelyimprisoned, that the Damosell might remaine solie to himselfe. Andcausing him to be called presently before him, with a very stearne andangry countenance, giving him many harsh and bitter speeches,commanded, that he should be clapt in prison.

　　The Monke very readily answered, saying. My good Lord, I have notyet beene so long in the Order of Saint Benedict, as to learne all theparticularities thereto belonging. And beside Sir, you never shewedmee or any of my Brethren, in what manner we young Monkes ought to usewomen, as you have otherwise done for our custome of prayer andfasting. But seeing you have so lately therein instructed mee, andby your owne example how to doe it: I heere solemnely promise you,if you please to pardon me but this one error, I will never failetherein againe, but dayly follow what I have seene you doe.

　　The Abbot, being a man of quicke apprehension, perceived instantlyby this answere; that the Monke not onely knew as much as he did,but also had seene (what was intended) that hee should not. Wherefore,finding himselfe to be as faulty as the Monke, and that hee couldnot shame him, but worthily had deserved as much himselfe; pardoninghim, and imposing silence on eithers offence: they convayed thepoore abused Damosell forth of their doores, she purposing (neverafter) to transgresse in the like manner.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　DECLARING, THAT WISE AND VERTUOUS LADIES, OUGHT TO HOLD

　　THEIR CHASTITIE IN MORE ESTEEME, THEN THE GREATNESSE AND

　　TREASURES OF PRINCES: AND THAT A DISCREETE LORD SHOULD NOT

　　OFFER MODESTIE VIOLENCE

　　The Lady Marquesse of Montferrat, with a Banquet of Hennes, anddivers other gracious speeches beside, repressed the fond love ofthe King of France.

　　The Tale reported by Dioneus, at the first hearing of the Ladies,began to rellish of some immodestie, as the bashfull blood mounting upinto their faces, delivered by apparant testimonie. And beholdingone another with scarse-pleasing lookes, during all the time it was indiscoursing, no sooner had he concluded: but with a few milde andgentle speeches, they gave him a modest reprehension, and meaning tolet him know that such tales ought not to be tolde among women.Afterward, the Queene commaunded Madam Fiammetta, (sitting on abanke of flowers before her) to take her turne as next in order; andshe, smiling with such a virgin blush, as very beautifully became her,began in this manner.

　　It is no little joy to mee, that we understand so well (by thediscourses already past) what power consisteth in the delivery of wiseand readie answeres; And because it is a great part of sence andjudgement in men, to affect women of greater birth and quality thenthemselves, as also an admirable fore-sight in women, to keepe offfrom being surprized in love, by Lords going beyond them in degree:a matter offereth it selfe to my memory, well deserving my speechand your attention, how a Gentlewoman (both in word and deede)should defend her honor in that kind, when importunity laboureth tobetray it.

　　The Marquesse of Montferrat was a worthy and valiant Knight, whobeing Captaine Generall for the Church, the necessary service requiredhis company on the Seas, in a goodly Army of the Christians againstthe Turkes. Upon a day, in the Court of King Philip, sirnamed theone eyed King (who likewise made preparation in France, for a royallassistance to that expedition) as many speeches were delivered,concerning the valour and manhoode of this Marquesse: it fortuned,that a Knight was then present, who knew him very familiarly, and hegave an addition to the former commendation, that the whole worldcontained not a more equall couple in marriage, then the Marquesse andhis Lady. For, as among all knights, the Marquesse could hardly beparaleld for Armes and Honour; even so his wife, in comparison ofall other Ladies, was scarcely matchable for beauty and vertue.Which words were so weighty in the apprehension of King Philip, thatsodainly (having as yet never seen her) he began to affect her veryearnestly, concluding to embarke himselfe at Gennes or Genoua, thereto set forward on the intended voyage, and journying thither byland, hee would shape some honest excuse to see the Lady Marquesse,whose Lord being then from home, opinion perswaded him over fondly,that he should easily obtaine the issue of his amorous desire.

　　When hee was come within a dayes journey, where the LadieMarquesse then lay; he sent her word that she should expect hiscompany on the morrow at dinner. The Lady, being singularly wise andjudicious, answered the Messenger, that she reputed the Kingscomming to her, as an extraordinary grace and favour, and that heshould bee most heartily welcome. Afterward, entring into furtherconsideration with her selfe, what the King might meane by his privatevisitation, knowing her Husband to be from home, and it to bee nomeane barre to his apter entertainement: at last she discreetlyconceited (and therin was not deceived) that babling report of herbeauty and perfections, might thus occasion the Kings comming thither,his journey lying else a quite contrary way. Notwithstanding, beinga Princely Lady, and so loyal a wife as ever lived shee intended togive him her best entertainement: summoning the chiefest Gentlemenin the Country together, to take due order (by their advice) forgiving the King a gracious Welcome. But concerning the dinner, anddiet for service to his Table, that remained onely at her owndisposing.

　　Sending presently abroad, and buying all the Hennes that the Countryaffoorded, shee commaunded her Cookes, that onely of them (without anyother provision beside) they should prepare all the services that theycould devise. On the morrow, the King came according to his promise,and was most honourably welcomed by the Lady, who seemed in his eye(far beyond the Knights speeches of her) the fairest creature thatever he had seene before; whereat he mervailed not a little, extollingher perfections to be peerelesse, which much the more enflamed hisaffections, and (almost) made his desires impatient. The King beeingwithdrawne into such Chambers, as orderly were prepared for him, andas beseemed so great a Prince: the houre of dinner drawing on, theKing and the Lady Marquesse were seated at one Table, and hisattendants placed at other tables, answerable to their degrees ofhonour.

　　Plenty of dishes being served in, and the rarest Wines that theCountrey yeelded, the King had more minde to the faire Lady Marques,then any meate that stood on the Table. Neverthelesse, observingeach service after other, and that all the Viands (though variouslycooked, and in divers kindes) were nothing else but Hennes onely, hebegan to wonder; and so much the rather, because he knew the Countryto be of such quality, that it afforded all plenty both of Fowlesand Venison: beside, after the time of his comming was heard, they hadrespite enough, both for hawking and hunting; and therefore itencreased his marvell the more, that nothing was provided for him, butHennes onely: wherein to be the better resolved, turning a merrycountenance to the Lady, thus he spake. Madam, are Hennes onely bredin this Country, and no Cockes? The Lady Marquesse, very wellunderstanding his demand, which fitted her with an apt opportunity, tothwart his idle hope, and defend her owne honour; boldly returnedthe King this answere. Not so my Lord, but women and wives,howsoever they differ in garments and graces one from another; yetnotwithstanding, they are all heere as they bee in other places.

　　When the King heard this reply, he knew well enough the occasionof his Henne dinner, as also, what vertue lay couched under heranswere; perceiving apparantly, that wanton words would prove but invaine, and such a woman was not easily to be seduced; wherefore, ashee grew enamored on her inconsiderately, so he found it bestfitting for his honour, to quench this heate with wisedome discreetly.And so, without any more words, or further hope of speeding in sounkingly a purpose, dinner being ended, by a sudden departing, hesmoothly shadowed the cause of his comming, and thanking her for thehonour shee had done him, commended her to her chaste disposition, andposted away with speede to Gennes.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE SIXT NOVELL

　　DECLARING, THAT IN FEW, DISCREETE, AND WELL PLACED WORDS,

　　THE COVERED CRAFT OF CHURCH-MEN MAY BEE JUSTLY REPROVED, AND

　　THEIR HYPOCRISIE HONESTLY DISCOVERED

　　An honest plaine meaning man, (simply and conscionably)reprehended the malignity, hypocrisie, and misdemeanour of manyReligious persons.

　　Madam Aemilia sitting next to the gentle Lady Fiammetta,perceiving the modest chastisement, which the vertuous LadyMarquesse had given to the King of France, was generally graced by thewhole Assembly; began (after the Queene had thereto appointed her)in these words. Nor will I conceale the deserved reprehension, whichan honest simple lay-man, gave to a covetous holy Father, in veryfew words; yet more to be commended, then derided.

　　Not long since (worthy Ladies) there dwelt in our owne nativeCity, a Friar Minor, an Inquisitor after matters of Faith; who,although he laboured greatly to seeme a sanctified man, and an earnestaffecter of Christian Religion, (as all of them appeare to be inoutward shew;) yet he was a much better Inquisitor after them that hadtheir purses plenteously stored with money, then of such as wereslenderly grounded in Faith. By which diligent continued care inhim, he found out a man, more rich in purse, then understanding; andyet not so defective in matters of faith, as misguided by his ownesimple speaking, and (perhaps) when his braine was well warmed withwine, words fell more foolishly from him, then in better judgementthey could have done.

　　Being on a day in company, (very little differing in quality fromhim selfe) he chanced to say; that he had beene at such good wine,as God himselfe did never drinke better. Which words (by someSicophant then in presence) being carried to this curiousInquisitor, and he well knowing, that the mans faculties were great,and his bagges swolne up full with no meane abundance: Cum gladijset fustibus; With Booke, Bell, and Candle, he raysed an hoast ofexecrations against him, and the Sumner cited him with a solemneProcesse to appeare before him, understanding sufficiently, thatthis course would sooner fetch money from him, then amend anymisbeliefe in the man; for no further reformation did he seeke after.

　　The man comming before him, hee demanded, if the accusationintimated against him, was true or no? Whereto the honest mananswered, that he could not denie the speaking of such words, anddeclared in what manner they were uttered. Presently the Inquisitor,most devoutly addicted to Saint John with the golden beard, saide;What? Doest thou make our Lord a drinker, and a curious quaffer ofwines, as if he were a glutton, a belly-god, or a Taverne haunter,as thou, and other drunkards are. Being an hypocrite, as thou art,thou thinkest this to be but a light matter, because it may seeme soin thine owne opinion: but I tell thee plainely, that it deservethfire and faggot, if I should proceede in justice to inflict it onthee: with these, and other such like threatning words, as also a verystearne and angry countenance, he made the man beleeve himselfe tobe an Epicure, and that hee denied the eternity of the soule;whereby he fell into such a trembling feare, as doubting indeede,least he should be burned; that, to be more mercifully dealt withal,he rounded him in the eare, and by secret meanes, so annointed hishands with Saint Johns golden grease (a verie singular remedie againstthe Disease Pestilentiall in covetous Priests, especially FriarsMinors, that dare touch no money) as the case became very quicklyaltered.

　　This soveraigne Unction was of such vertue (though Galen speakes nota word thereof among all his cheefest Medicines) and so farreprevailed, that the terrible threatning words of fire and faggot,became meerly frozen up, and gracious language blew a more gentleand calmer ayre; the Inquisitor delivering him an hallowedCrucifixe, creating him a Soldier of the Crosse (because he hadpayed Crosses good store for it,) and even as if he were to travellunder that Standard to the holy Land; so did hee appoint him ahome-paying pennance, namely, to visit him thrice every weeke in hisChamber, and to annoint his hands with the selfe-same yellowunguent, and afterward, to heare Masse of the holy Crosse, visitinghim also at dinner time, which being ended, to do nothing all the restof the day, but according as he directed him.

　　The simple man, yet not so simple, but seeing that this weekelygreazing the Inquisitors hands, would in time graspe away all hisgold, grew weary of this annointing, and began to consider withhimselfe, how to stay the course of this chargeable penance. Andcomming one morning (according to his injunction) to heare Masse, inthe Gospell he observed these words; You shall receive an hundredfor one, and so possesse eternall life; which saying, he keptperfectly in his memory: and as he was commanded, at dinner time, hecame to the Inquisitor, finding him (among his fellowes) seated at theTable. The Inquisitor presently demaunded of him, whether he had heardMasse that morning, or no? Yes Sir, replyed the man very readily. Hastthou heard any thing therein (quoth the Inquisitor) whereof thou artdoubtfull, or desirst to be further informed? Surely Sir, answered theplaine-meaning man, I make no doubt of any thing I have heard, butdo beleeve all constantly: onely one thing troubleth me much, andmaketh me very compassionate of you, and of all these holy Fathersyour brethren, perceiving in what wofull and wretched estate youwill be, when you shall come into another world. What words are these,quoth the Inquisitor? And why art thou moved to such compassion of us?O good Sir, saide the man, do you remember the wordes in the Gospellthis morning, You shall receive an hundred for one? That is verie truereplyed the Inquisitor, but what mooveth thee to urge those words?I will tell you Sir, answered the plain fellow, so it might pleaseyou not to be offended. Since the time of my resorting hither, Ihave daily seene many poore people at your doore, and (out of yourabundance) when you and your Brethren have fed sufficiently, every onehath had a good messe of Pottage: now Sir, if for every dishfullgiven, you are sure to receive an hundred againe, you will all bemeerely drowned in pottage. Although the rest (sitting at the Tablewith the Inquisitor) laughed heartily at this jest; yet he foundhimselfe toucht in another nature, having hypocritically received forone poore offence, above three hundred peeces of Gold, and not a miteto be restored againe. But fearing to be further disclosed, yetthreatning him with another Processe in law, for abusing the words ofthe Gospel, he was content to dismisse him for altogither, withoutany more golden greasing in the hand.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　APPROVING, THAT IT IS MUCH UNFITTING FOR A PRINCE, OR GREAT

　　PERSON, TO BEE COVETOUS; BUT RATHER TO BE LIBERALL TO

　　ALL MEN

　　Bergamino, by telling a tale of a skilfull man, named Primasso,and of an Abbot of Clugni; honestly checked a new kinde ofCovetousnesse, in Mayster Can de la Scala.

　　The courteous demeanor of Madam Aemilia, and the quaintnesse ofher discourse, caused both the Queene, and the rest of the company, tocommend the invention of carrying the Crosse, and the goldenoyntment appointed for pennance. Afterward, Philostratus, who was inorder to speake next, began in this manner.

　　It is a commendable thing (faire Ladies) to hit a But that neverstirreth out of his place: but it is a matter much more admirable,to see a thing suddainely appearing, and sildome or never frequentedbefore, to bee as suddenly hit by an ordinary Archer. The viciousand polluted lives of Priests, yeeldeth matter of it selfe in manythings, deserving speech and reprehension, as a true But of wickednes,and well worthy to be sharply shot at. And therefore, though thathonest meaning man did wisely, in touching Master Inquisitor to thequicke, with the hypocriticall charity of Monkes and Friars, in givingsuch things to the poore, as were more meete for Swine, or to be worsethrowne away, yet I hold him more to be commended, who (by occasion ofa former tale, and which I purpose to relate) pleasantly reproovedMaster Can de la Scala, a Magnifico and mighty Lord, for a suddenand unaccustomed covetousnesse appearing in him, figuring by othermen, that which hee intended to say of him, in manner following.

　　Master Can de la Scala, as fame ranne abroad of him in all places,was (beyond the infinite favours of Fortune towards him) one of themost notable and magnificent Lords that ever lived in Italy, since thedaies of Fredericke the second, Emperor. He determining to procure avery solemne assembly at Verona, and many people being met therefrom divers places, especially Gentlemen of all degrees; suddenly(upon what occasion I know not) his minde altred, and hee would notgoe forward with his intention. Most of them he partly recompencedwhich were come thither, and they dismissed to depart at theirpleasure, one onely man remained unrespected, or in any kinde sortsent away, whose name was Bergamino, a man very pleasantly disposed,and so wittily readie in speaking and answering, as none couldeasily credit it, but such as heard him; and although his recompenceseemed over-long delayed, yet hee made no doubt of a beneficiallending.

　　By some enemies of his, Master Can de la Scala was incensed, thatwhatsoever he gave or bestowed on him, was as ill imployed and utterlylost, as if it were throwne into the fire, and therefore he neitherdid or spake any thing to him. Some few dayes being passed over, andBergamino perceiving, that hee was neither called, nor any accountmade of, notwithstanding many manly good parts in him; observingbeside, that hee found a shrewd consumption in his purse, his Inne,horses, and servants, being chargeable to him, he began to growextremely melancholly, and yet hee attended in expectation day by day,as thinking it farre unfitting for him, to depart before he was biddenfarewell.

　　Having brought with him thither three goodly rich garments, whichhad beene given him by sundrie Lords, for his more sightlyappearance at this great meeting; the importunate Host being greedieof payment, first he delivered him one of them, and yet not halfethe score being wiped off, the second must needes follow; andbeside, except he meant to leave his lodging, hee must live upon thethird so long as it would last, till hee saw what end his hopeswould sort too. It fortuned, during the time of living thus upon hislast refuge, that hee met with Maister Can one day at dinner, where hepresented himselfe before him, with a discontented countenance:which Maister Can well observing, more to distaste him, then takedelight in any thing that could come from him, he sayd. Bergamino, howcheerest thou? Thou art very melancholly, I prythee tell us why?Bergamino suddenly, without any premeditation, yet seeming as if hehad long considered thereon, reported this Tale.

　　Sir, I have heard of a certaine man, named Primasso, one skilfullylearned in the Grammar, and (beyond all other) a very witty andready versifier: in regard whereof, he was so much admired, andfarre renowned, that such as never saw him, but onely heard of him,could easily say, this is Primasso. It came to passe, that beingonce at Paris, in poore estate, as commonly he could light on nobetter fortune (because vertue is slenderly rewarded, by such ashave the greatest possessions) he heard much fame of the Abbot ofClugni, a man reputed (next to the Pope) to be the richest Prelateof the Church. Of him he heard wonderfull and magnificent matters,that he alwayes kept an open and hospitable Court, and never maderefusall of any (from whence soever hee came or went) but they dideate and drinke freely there; provided, that they came when theAbbot was set at the Table. Primasso hearing this, and being anearnest desirer to see magnificent and vertuous men, hee resolved togoe see this rare bounty of the Abbot, demanding how far he dwelt fromParis? Being answered, about some three Leagues thence. Primassomade account, that if he went on betimes in the morning, he shouldeasily reach thither before the houre for dinner.

　　Being instructed in the way, and not finding any to walke along withhim; fearing, if he went without some furnishment, and should staylong there for his dinner, he might (perhaps) complaine of hunger:he therefore carried three loaves of bread with him, knowing that hecould meet with water every where, albeit he used to drinke butlittle. Having aptly conveyed his bread about him, he went on hisjourny, and arrived at the Lord Abbots Court, an indifferent whilebefore dinner time: wherefore entering into the great Hall, and sofrom place to place, beholding the great multitude of Tables,bountifull preparation in the Kitchin, and what admirable provisionthere was for dinner, he said to himselfe; Truly this man is moremagnificent then fame hath made him, because shee speakes toosparingly of him.

　　While thus he went about, considering on all these things veryrespectively, he saw the Maister of the Abbots Houshold (becausethen it was the houre of dinner) command water to be brought forwashing hands, so everie one sitting down at the Tatle, it fell to thelot of Primasso, to sit directly against the doore, whereat theAbbot must enter into the Hall. The custome in this Court was such,that no manner of Foode should be served to any of the Table, untillsuch time as the Lord Abbot was himselfe set: whereupon, every thingbeing fit and ready, the Master of the Houshold went to tell his Lord,that nothing now wanted but his onely presence.

　　The Abbot comming from his Chamber to enter the Hall, lookingabout him, as hee was wont to doe; the first man hee saw was Primasso,who being but in homely habite, and he having not seene him beforeto his remembrance, a present bad conceite possessed his braine,that he never saw an unworthier person, saying within himselfe: Seehow I give my goods away to bee devoured. So returning backe to hisChamber againe; commaunded the doore to be made fast, demaunding ofevery man neere about him, if they knew the base Knave that satebefore his entrance into the Hall, and all his servants answered no.Primasso being extreamely hungry, with travailing on foote so farre,and never used to fast so long; expecting still when meate would beserved in, and that the Abbot came not at all: drew out one of hisloaves which hee brought with him, and very heartily fell to feeding.

　　My Lord Abbot, after hee had stayed within an indifferent while,sent forth one of his men, to see if the poore fellow was gone, or no.The servant told him, that he stayed there, and fed upon dry bread,which it seemed he had brought thither with him. Let him feede onhis owne (replyed the Abbot) for he shall taste of none of mine thisday. Gladly wold the Abbot, that Primasso should have gone thence ofhimselfe, and yet held it scarsely honest in his Lordship, to dismissehim by his owne command. Primasso having eaten one of his Loaves,and yet the Abbot was not come; began to feede upon the second: theAbbot still sending to expect his absence, and answered as he wasbefore. At length, the Abbot not comming, and Primasso having eaten uphis second loafe, hunger compeld him to begin with the third.

　　When these newes were carried to the Abbot, sodainly he brakeforth and saide. What new kinde of needy tricke hath my braine begottethis day? Why do I grow disdainfull against any man whatsoever? I havelong time allowed my meate to be eaten by all commers that didplease to visit me, without exception against any person, Gentleman,Yeoman, poore or rich, Marchant or Minstrill, honest man or knave,never refraining my presence in the Hall, by basely contemning onepoore man. Beleeve me, covetousnesse of one mans meate, doth ill agreewith mine estate and calling. What though he appeareth a wretchedfellow to me? He may be of greater merit then I can imagine, anddeserve more honor then I am able to give him.

　　Having thus discoursed with himselfe, he would needs understand ofwhence, and what he was, and finding him to be Primasso, come onely tosee the magnificence which he had reported of him, knowing also (bythe generall fame noysed every where of him) that he was reputed to bea learned, honest, and ingenious man: he grew greatly ashamed of hisowne folly, and being desirous to make him an amends, strove manywaies how to do him honor. When dinner was ended, the Abbot bestowedhonorable garments on him, such as beseemed his degree and merit,and putting good store of money in his purse, as also giving him agood horse to ride on, left it at his owne free election, whether hewould stay there still with him, or depart at his pleasure.Wherewith Primasso being highly contented, yeelding him theheartiest thankes he could devise to do, returned to Paris onhorse-backe, albeit he came poorely thether on foot.

　　Master Can de la Scala, who was a man of good understanding,perceived immediately (without any further interpretation) whatBergamino meant by this morall, and smiling on him, saide:Bergamino, thou hast honestly expressed thy vertue and necessities,and justly reprooved mine avarice, niggardnesse, and base folly. Andtrust me Bergamino, I never felt such a fit of covetousnesse come uponme, as this which I have dishonestly declared to thee: and which Iwill now banish from me, with the same correction as thou hasttaught mee. So, having payed the Host all his charges, redeemingalso his robes or garments, mounting him on a good Gelding, andputting plenty of Crownes in his purse, he referd it to his ownechoise to depart, or dwell there still with him.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE EIGHT NOVELL

　　WHICH PLAINLY DECLARETH, THAT A COVETOUS GENTLEMAN, IS NOT

　　WORTHY OF ANY HONOR OR RESPECT

　　Guillaume Boursier, with a few quaint and familiar words, checkt themiserable covetousnesse of Signior Herminio de Grimaldi.

　　Madam Lauretta, sitting next to Philostratus, when she had heard thewitty conceite of Bergamino; knowing, that she was to say somewhat,without injunction or command, pleasantly thus began.

　　This last discourse (faire and vertuous company) induceth me to tellyou, how an honest Courtier reprehended in like manner (and nothingunprofitably) base covetousnesse in a Merchant of extraordinarywealth. Which Tale, although (in effect) it may seeme to resemblethe former; yet perhaps, it will prove no lesse pleasing to you, inregard it sorted to as good an end.

　　It is no long time since, that there lived in Genes or Geneway, aGentleman named Signior Herminio de Grimaldo, who (as every one welknew) was more rich in inheritances, and ready summes of currant moneythen any other knowne Citizen in Italy. And as hee surpassed other menin wealth, so did he likewise excell them in wretched Avarice, beingso miserably greedy and covetous, as no man in the world could be morewicked that way; because, not onely he kept his purse lockt up frompleasuring any, but denied needfull things to himselfe, enduringmany miseries onely to avoid expences, contrary to the Genewayesgenerall custom, who alwayes delighted to be decently cloathed, and tohave their dyet of the best. By reason of which most miserablebasenesse, they tooke away from him the Sirname of Grimaldi, whereofhe was in right descended, and called him master Herminio the covetousMizer, a nickname very notably agreeing with his gripple nature.

　　It came to passe, that in this time of his spending nothing, butmultiplying daily by infinite meanes, that a civill honest Gentleman(a Courtier of ready wit, and discoursive in Languages) came toGeneway, being named Guillaume Boursier. A man very farre differingfrom divers Courtiers in these dayes, who for soothing shamefull andgracelesse maners in such as allow them maintenance, are called andreputed to bee Gentlemen, yea speciall favourites: whereas much moreworthily, they should be accounted as knaves and villaines, beingborne and bred in all filthinesse, and skilfull in every kinde ofbasest behaviour, not fit to come in Princes Courts. For, whereas inpassed times, they spent their dayes and paines in making peace,when Gentlemen were at warre or dissention, or treating on honestmarriages, betweene friends and familiars, and (with lovingspeeches) would recreate disturbed mindes, desiring none butcommendable exercises in Court, and sharpely reprooving (like Fathers)disordred life, or ill actions in any, albeit with recompencelittle, or none at all; these upstarts now adayes, employ all theirpaines in detractions, sowing questions and quarrels betweene oneanother, making no spare of lyes and falshoods. Nay which is worse,they wil do this in the presence of any man, upbraiding him withinjuries, shames, and scandals (true or not true) upon the veryleast occasion. And by false and deceitful flatteries and villanies oftheir owne inventing, they make Gentlemen to become as vile asthemselves. For which detestable qualities, they are better belovedand respected of their misdemeanored Lords, and recompenced in morebountifull maner, then men of vertuous carriage and desert. Which isan argument sufficient, that goodnesse is gone up to heaven, andhath quite forsaken these loathed lower Regions, where men are drownedin the mud of all abhominable vices.

　　But returning where I left (being led out of my way by a just andreligious anger against such deformity) this Gentleman, MasterGuillaume Boursier, was willingly seene, and gladly welcommed by allthe best men in Geneway. Having remained some few daies in the City,and amongst other matters, heard much talke of the miserablecovetousnesse of master Herminio, he grew very desirous to have asight of him. Master Herminio had already understood, that thisGentleman, Master Guillaume Boursier was vertuously disposed, and (howcovetously soever hee was inclined) having in him some sparkes ofnoble nature, gave him very good words, and gracious entertainment,discoursing with him on divers occasions.

　　In company of other Genewayes with him, he brought him to a newerected house of his, a building of great cost and beauty; where,after he had shewne him all the variable rarieties, he beganne thus.Master Guillaume, no doubt but you have heard and seene many things,and you can instruct me in some queint conceit or device, to be fairlyfigured in painting, at the entrance into the great Hall of myHouse. Master Guillaume hearing him speake so simply, returned himthis answer: Sir, I cannot advise you in any thing, so rare or unseeneas you talk of: but how to sneeze (after a new manner) upon a full andover-cloyed stomacke, to avoyde base humours that stupifie the braine,or other matters of the like quality. But if you would be taught agood one indeede, and had a disposition to see it fairely effected,I could instruct you in an excellent Emblem, wherwith (as yet) younever came acquainted.

　　Master Herminio hearing him say so, and expecting no such answeras he had, saide, Good Master Guillaume, tell me what it is, and on myfaith I will have it fairely painted. Whereto Master Guillaumesuddenly replied; Do nothing but this Sir: Paint over the Portall ofyour Halles enterance, the lively picture of Liberality, to bid allyour friends better welcome, then hitherto they have beene. WhenMaster Herminio heard these words, he becam possessed with such asudden shame, that his complexion changed from the former palenesse,and answered thus. Master Guillaume, I will have your advice sotruly figured over my gate, and shee shall give so good welcome to allmy guests, that both you, and all these Gentlemen shall say, I haveboth seene her, and am become reasonably acquainted with her. Fromthat time forward, the words of Master Guillaume were so effectuallwith Signior Herminio, that he became the most bountifull and besthouse-keeper, which lived in his time in Geneway: no man morehonouring and friendly welcoming both strangers and Citizens, thenhe continually used to do.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　GIVING ALL MEN TO UNDERSTAND, THAT JUSTICE IS NECESSARY

　　IN A KING ABOVE AL THINGS ELSE WHATSOEVER

　　The King of Cyprus was wittily reprehended, by the words of aGentlewoman of Gascoignie, and became vertuously altered from hisvicious disposition.

　　The last command of the Queene, remained upon Madam Elissa, orEliza, who (without any delaying) thus beganne. Young Ladies, ithath often beene seene, that much paine hath beene bestowed, andmany reprehensions spent in vaine, till a word happening at adventure,and perhaps not purposely determined, hath effectually done the deede:as appeareth by the Tale of Madame Lauretta, and another of mine owne,where with I intend briefly to acquaint you, approving that whengood words are discreetly observed, they are of soveraigne power andvertue.

　　In the dayes of the first King of Cyprus, after the Conquest made inthe holy Land by Godfrey of Bullen, it fortuned that a Gentlewomanof Gascoignie, travelling in pilgrimage to visit the sacredSepulcher in Jerusalem, returning home againe, arrived at Cyprus,where shee was villanously abused by certaine base wretches.Complaining thereof, without any comfort or redresse, shee intended tomake her moane to the King of the Country. Whereupon it was tolde her,that therein shee should but loose her labour, because hee was sowomanish, and faint-hearted; that not onely he refused to punishwith justice the offence of others, but also suffered shamefullinjuries done to himselfe. And therefore, such as were displeased byhis negligence, might easily discharge their spleene against him,and doe him what dishonour they would.

　　When the Gentlewoman heard this, despairing of any consolation, orrevenge for her wrongs, shee resolved to checke the Kings deniall ofjustice, and comming before him weeping, spake in this manner. Sir,I presume not into your presence, as hoping to have redresse by you,for divers dishonourable injuries done unto me; but, as fullsatisfaction for them, doe but teach me how you suffer such vileabuses, as daily are offered to your selfe. To the end, that beingtherein instructed by you, I may the more patiently beare mine owne;which (as God knoweth) I would bestow on you very gladly, becauseyou know so well how to endure them.

　　The King, who (till then) had beene very bad, dull, and slothfull,even as sleeping out his time of governement; beganne to revenge thewrongs done to this Gentlewoman very severely, and (thence forward)became a most sharpe Justicer, for the least offence offered againstthe honour of his Crowne, or to any of his subjects beside.

　　THE FIRST DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THAT HONEST LOVE AGREETH WITH PEOPLE

　　OF ALL AGES

　　Master Albert of Bullen, honestly made a Lady to blush, that thoughtto have done as much to him, because shee perceived him, to beamorously affected towards her.

　　After that Madam Eliza sate silent, the last charge and labour ofthe like employment, remained to the Queene her selfe; whereuponshee beganne thus to speake: Honest and vertuous young Ladies, like asthe Starres (when the Ayre is faire and cleere) are the adorning andbeauty of Heaven, and flowers (while the Spring time lasteth) doegraciously embellish the Meadowes; even so sweete speeches andpleasing conferences, to passe the time with commendable discourses,are the best habit of the minde, and an outward beauty to the body:which ornaments of words, when they appeare to be short and sweete,are much more seemely in women, then in men; because long andtedious talking (when it may be done in lesser time) is a greaterblemish in women, then in men.

　　Among us women, this day, I thinke few or none have thereinoffended, but as readily have understood short and pithy speeches, asthey have beene quicke and quaintly delivered. But when answeringsuteth not with understanding, it is generally a shame in us, and allsuch as live; because our moderne times have converted that vertue,which was within them who lived before us, into garments of the body,and shew whose habites were noted to bee most gaudy, fullest ofimbroyderies and fantastick fashions: she was reputed to have mostmatter in her, and therefore to be more honoured and esteemed. Neverconsidering, that whosoever loadeth the backe of an Asse, or puts uponhim the richest braverie; he becommeth not thereby a jot the wiser, ormeriteth any more honor then an Asse should have. I am ashamed tospeake it, because in detecting other, I may (perhaps) as justly taxemy selfe.

　　Such imbroydered bodies, tricked and trimmed in such boastingbravery, are they any thing else but as Marble Statues, dumbe, dull,and utterly insensible? Or if (perchaunce) they make an answere,when some question is demanded of them; it were much better for themto be silent. For defence of honest devise and conference among menand women, they would have the world to thinke, that it proceedeth butfrom simplicity and precise opinion, covering their owne folly withthe name of honesty: as if there were no other honest woman, butshee that conferres onely with her Chambermaide, Laundresse, orKitchin-woman: as if nature had allowed them, (in their owne idleconceite) no other kinde of talking.

　　Most true it is, that as there is a respect to be used in the actionof things; so, time and place are necessarily to be considered, andalso whom we converse withall; because sometimes it happeneth, thata man or woman, intending (by a word of jest and merriment) to makeanother body blush or be ashamed: not knowing what strength of witremaineth in the opposite, doe convert the same disgrace uponthemselves. Therefore, that we may the more advisedly stand upon ourowne guard, and to prevent the common proverbe, That Women (in allthings) make choyse of the worst: I desire that this dayes lasttale, which is to come from my selfe, may make us all wise. To theend, that as in gentlenesse of minde we conferre with other; so byexcellency in good manners, we may shew our selves not inferiour tothem.

　　It is not many yeares since (worthy assembly) that in Bulloignethere dwelt a learned Physitian, a man famous for skill, and farrerenowned, whose name was Master Albert, and being growne aged, tothe estimate of threescore and tenne yeares: hee had yet such asprightly disposition, that though naturall heate and vigour had quiteshaken hands with him, yet amorous flames and desires had not whollyforsaken him. Having seene (at a Banquet) a very beautifull woman,being then in the estate of widdowhood, named (as some say) MadamMargaret de Chisolieri, shee appeared so pleasing in his eye; that hissences became no lesse disturbed, then as if he had beene of farreyounger temper, and no night could any quietnesse possesse hissoule, except (the day before) he had seene the sweet countenance ofthis lovely widdow. In regard whereof, his dayly passage was by herdoore, one while on horsebacke, and then againe on foot; as best mightdeclare his plaine purpose to see her.

　　Both shee and other Gentlewomen, perceiving the occasion of hispassing and repassing; would privately jest thereat together, to see aman of such yeares and discretion, to be amorously addicted, oroverswayed by effeminate passions. For they were partly perswaded,that such wanton Ague fits of Love, were fit for none but youthfullapprehensions, as best agreeing with their chearefull complexion.Master Albert continuing his dayly walkes by the widdowes lodging,it chaunced upon a Feastivall day, that shee (accompanied withdivers other women of great account) being sitting at her doore;espied Master Albert (farre off) comming thitherward, and a resolveddetermination among themselves was set downe, to allow himfavourable entertainement, and to jest (in some merry manner) at hisloving folly, as afterward they did indeede.

　　No sooner was he come neere, but they all arose, and courteouslyinvited him to enter with them, conducting him into a goodly Garden,where readily was prepared choyse of delicate wines and banquetting.At length, among other pleasant and delightfull discourses, theydemanded of him; how it was possible for him, to be amorously affectedtowards so beautifull a woman, both knowing and seeing, howearnestly she was sollicited by many gracious, gallant, andyouthfull spirits, aptly suting with her yeares and desires? MasterAlbert perceiving, that they had drawne him in among them, onely toscoffe and make a mockery of him; set a merry countenance on thematter, and honestly thus answered.

　　Beleeve mee Gentlewoman (speaking to the widdowe her selfe) itshould not appeare strange to any of wisedome and discretion, that Iam amorously enclined, and especially to you, because you are wellworthy of it. And although those powers, which naturally appertaine tothe exercises of Love, are bereft and gone from aged people; yetgood will thereto cannot be taken from them, neither judgement to knowsuch as deserve to be affected: for, by how much they exceede youth inknowledge and experience, by so much the more hath nature made themmeet for respect and reverence. The hope which incited me (being aged)to love you, that are affected of so many youthfull Gallants, grewthus. I have often chaunced into divers places, where I have seeneLadies and Gentlwomen, being disposed to a Collation or rerebanquetafter dinner, to feede on Lupines, and young Onions or Leekes, andalthough it may be so, that there is little or no goodnesse at allin them; yet the heads of them are least hurtfull, and most pleasingin the mouth. And you Gentlewomen generally (guided by unreasonableappetite) will hold the heads of them in your hands, and feede uponthe blades or stalkes: which not onely are not good for any thing, butalso are of very bad savour. And what know I (Lady) whether amongthe choise of friends, it may fit your fancy to doe the like? For,if you did so, it were no fault of mine to be chosen of you, butthereby were all the rest of your suters the sooner answered.

　　The widdowed Gentlewoman, and all the rest in her company, beingbashfully ashamed of her owne and their folly, presently said.Master Albert, you have both well and worthily chastised our over-boldpresumption, and beleeve me Sir, I repute your love and kindnesse ofno meane merrit, comming from a man so wise and vertuous: Andtherefore (mine honour reserved) commaund my uttermost, as alwayesready to do you any honest service. Master Albert, arising from hisseat, thanking the faire widdow for her gentle offer; tooke leave ofher and all the company, and she blushing, as all the rest weretherein not much behinde her, thinking to checke him, became chiddenher selfe, whereby (if we be wise) let us all take warning.

　　The Sunne was now somewhat farre declined, and the heatesextremity well worne away: when the Tales of the seaven Ladies andthree Gentlemen were thus finished, whereupon their Queenepleasantly said. For this day (faire company) there remaineth nothingmore to be done under my regiment, but onely to bestow a new Queeneupon you, who (according to her judgement) must take her turne, anddispose what next is to be done, for continuing our time in honestpleasure. And although the day should endure till darke night; inregard, that when some time is taken before, the better preparationmay bee made for occasions to follow, to the end also, that whatsoeverthe new Queene shall please to appoint, may be the better fitted forthe morrow: I am of opinion, that at the same houre as we now cease,the following dayes shall severally begin. And therefore, in reverenceto him that giveth life to all things, and in hope of comfort by oursecond day; Madam Philomena, a most wise young Lady, shall governeas Queene this our Kingdome.

　　So soone as she had thus spoken, arising from her seate ofdignity, and taking the Lawrell Crowne from off her owne head; shereverently placed it upon Madam Philomenaes, shee first of allhumbly saluting her, and then all the rest, openly confessing her tobe their Queene, made gracious offer to obey whatsoever she commanded.Philomena, her cheekes delivering a scarlet tincture, to see her selfethus honoured as their Queene, and well remembring the words, solately uttered by Madam Pampinea; that dulnesse or neglect might notbe noted in her, tooke cheerefull courage to her, and first of all,she confirmed the officers, which Pampinea had appointed the daybefore, then she ordained for the morrowes provision, as also forthe supper so neere approiching, before they departed away fromthence, and then thus began.

　　Lovely Companions, although that Madam Pampinea, more in her ownecourtesie, then any matter of merit remaining in me, hath made me yourQueene: I am not determined, to alter the forme of our intendedlife, nor to be guided by mine owne judgement, but to associate thesame with your assistance. And because you may know what I intend todo, and so (consequently) adde or diminish at your pleasure; in veryfew words, you shall plainly understand my meaning. If you have wellconsidered on the course, which this day hath bene kept by MadamPampinea, me thinkes it hath bene very pleasing and commendable; inwhich regard, untill by over-tedious continuation, or otheroccasions of irkesome offence, it shall seeme injurious, I am of theminde, not to alter it. Holding on the order then as we have begunto doe, we will depart from hence to recreate our selves a while,and when the Sun groweth towards setting, we will sup in the fresh andopen ayre; afterward, with Canzonets and other pastimes, we willout-weare the houres till bed time. To morrow morning, in the freshand gentle breath thereof, we will rise and walke to such places, asevery one shall finde fittest for them, even as already this day wehave done; untill due time shall summon us hither againe, tocontinue our discoursive Tales, wherein (me thinkes) consisteth bothpleasure and profit, especially by discreete observation.

　　Very true it is, that some things which Madam Pampinea could notaccomplish, by reason of her so small time of authority, I willbegin to undergo, to wit, in restraining some matters whereon we areto speake, that better premeditation may passe upon them. For, whenrespite and a little leysure goeth before them, each discourse willsavour of the more formality; and if it might so please you, thuswould I direct the order. As since the beginning of the world, all menhave bene guided (by Fortune) thorow divers accidents and occasions:so beyond all hope and expectation, the issue and successe hath bingood and successful, and accordingly should every one of our argumentsbe chosen.

　　The Ladies, and the yong Gentlemen likewise, commended her advice,and promised to imitate it; onely Dioneus excepted, who when every onewas silent, spake thus. Madam, I say as all the rest have done, thatthe order by you appointed, is most pleasing and worthy to beeallowed. But I intreate one speciall favour for my selfe, and to haveit confirmed to mee, so long as our company continueth; namely, that Imay not be constrained to this Law of direction, but to tell my Taleat liberty, after mine owne minde, and according to the freedome firstinstituted. And because no one shall imagine, that I urge this graceof you, as being unfurnished of discourses in this kinde, I am wellcontented to bee the last in every dayes exercise.

　　The Queene, knowing him to be a man full of mirth and matter,began to consider very advisedly, that he would not have mooved thisrequest, but onely to the end, that if the company grew wearied by anyof the Tales re-counted, hee would shut up the dayes disport with somemirthfull accident. Wherefore willingly, and with consent of all therest he had his suite granted. So, arising all, they walked to aChristall river, descending downe a little hill into a valley,graciously shaded with goodly Trees; where washing both their handsand feete, much pretty pleasure passed among them; till supper timedrawing neere, made them returne home to the Palace. When supper wasended, and bookes and instruments being laide before them, theQueene commanded a dance, and that Madam Aemilia, assisted by MadamLauretta and Dioneus, should sing a sweet ditty. At which command,Lauretta undertooke the dance, and led it, Aemilia singing this songensuing.

　　THE SONG

　　So much delight my beauty yeelds to mee,

　　That any other Love,

　　To wish or prove;

　　Can never sute it selfe with my desire.

　　Therein I see, upon good observation,

　　What sweet content due understanding lends:

　　Old or new thoughts cannot in any fashion

　　Rob me of that, which mine owne soule commends.

　　What object then,

　　(mongst infinites of men)

　　Can I never finde

　　to dispossesse my minde,

　　And plaint therein another new desire?

　　So much delight, etc.

　　But were it so, the blisse that I would chuse,

　　Is, by continuall sight to comfort me:

　　So rare a presence never to refuse,

　　Which mortall tongue or thought, what ere it be

　　Must still conceale,

　　not able to reveale,

　　Such a sacred sweete,

　　for none other meete,

　　But hearts enflamed with the same desire.

　　So much delight, etc.

　　The Song being ended, the Chorus whereof was answered by them all,it passed with generall applause: and after a few other daunces, thenight being well run on, the Queene gave ending to this first dayesRecreation. So, lights being brought, they departed to theirseverall Lodgings, to take their rest till the next morning.

　　THE INDUCTION TO THE SECOND DAY

　　WHEREIN, ALL THE DISCOURSES ARE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF

　　MADAM PHILOMENA: CONCERNING SUCH MEN OR WOMEN, AS (IN DIVERS

　　ACCIDENTS) HAVE BEEN MUCH MOLLESTED BY FORTUNE, AND YET AFTERWARD

　　(CONTRARY TO THEIR HOPE AND EXPECTATION) HAVE HAD

　　A HAPPY AND SUCCESSEFULL DELIVERANCE

　　Already had the bright Sunne renewed the day every where with hissplendant beames, and the Birds sate merrily singing on the bloomingbranches, yeelding testimony thereof to the eares of all hearers; whenthe seven Ladies, and the three Gentlemen (after they were risen)entered the Gardens, and there spent some time in walking, as alsomaking of Nose-gayes and Chaplets of Flowers. And even as they haddone the day before, so did they now follow the same course; for,after they had dined, in a coole and pleasing aire they fell todancing, and then went to sleepe a while, from which being awaked,they tooke their places (according as it pleased the Queene toappoint) in the same faire Meadow about her. And she, being a goodlycreature, and highly pleasing to behold, having put on her Crowne ofLawrell, and giving a gracious countenance to the whole company;commanded Madam Neiphila that her Tale should begin this daiesdelight. Whereupon she, without returning any excuse or deniall, beganin this manner.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS SIGNIFIED, HOW EASIE A THING IT IS, FOR WICKED MEN

　　TO DECEIVE THE WORLD, UNDER THE SHADOW AND COLOUR OF MIRACLES:

　　AND THAT SUCH TREACHERY (OFTENTIMES) REDOUNDETH TO

　　THE HARME OF THE DEVISER

　　Martellino counterfeitting to be lame of his members, causedhimselfe to be set on the body of Saint Arriguo, where he made shew ofhis sudden recovery; but when his dissimulation was discovered, he waswell beaten, being afterward taken prisoner, and in great danger ofbeing hanged and strangled by the necke, and yet he escaped in theend.

　　Faire Ladies, it hath happened many times, that he who striveth toscorne and floute other men, and especially in occasions deservingto be respected, proveth to mocke himselfe with the selfe same matter,yea, and to his no meane danger beside. As you shall perceive by aTale, which I intend to tell you, obeying therein the command of ourQueene, and according to the subject by her enjoyned. In whichdiscourse, you may first observe, what great mischance happened to oneour Citizens; and yet afterward, how (beyond all hope) he happilyescaped.

　　Not long since, there lived in the City of Trevers, an Almaine orGermaine, named Arriguo, who being a poore man, served as a Porter, orburden-bearer for money, when any man pleased to employ him. Andyet, notwithstanding his poore and meane condition, he was generallyreputed, to be of good and sanctified life. In which regard (whetherit were true or no, I know not) it happened, that when he died (atleast as the men of Trevers themselves affirmed) in the very instanthoure of his departing, all the Belles in the great Church of Trevers,(not being pulled by the helpe of any hand) beganne to ring: whichbeing accounted for a miracle, every one saide; that this Arriguohad bene, and was a Saint. And presently all the people of the Cityran to the house where the dead body lay, and carried it (as asanctified body) into the great Church, where people, halt, lame,and blind, or troubled with any other diseases, were brought about it,even as if every one should forth-with be holpen, onely by theirtouching the body.

　　It came to passe, that in so great a concourse of people, asresorted thither from all parts; three of our Citizens went toTrevers, one of them being named Stechio, the second Martellino, andthe third Marquiso, all being men of such condition, as frequentedPrinces Courts, to give them delight by pleasant and counterfettedqualities. None of these men having ever beene at Trevers before,seeing how the people crowded thorow the streetes, wondered greatlythereat: but when they knew the reason why the throngs ranne on heapesin such sort together, they grew as desirous to see the Shrine, as anyof the rest. Having ordered all affaires at their lodging, Marquisosaide; It is fit for us to see this Saint, but I know not how we shallattaine thereto, because (as I have heard) the place is guarded byGermaine Souldiers, and other warlike men, commanded thither by theGovernour of this City, least any outrage should be there committed:And beside, the Church is so full of people, as we shall nevercompasse to get neere. Martellino being also as forward in desire tosee it, presently replied. All this difficulty cannot dismay me, but Iwill go to the very body of the Saint it selfe. But how? quothMarquiso. I will tell thee, answered Martellino. I purpose to go inthe disguise of an impotent lame person, supported on the one sideby thy selfe, and on the other by Stechio, as if I were not able towalke of my selfe: And you two thus sustaining me, desiring to comeneere the Saint to cure me; every one will make way, and freely giveyou leave to go on.

　　This devise was very pleasing to Marquiso and Stechio, so that(without any further delaying) they all three left their lodging,and resorting into a secret corner aside, Martellino so writhed andmishaped his hands, fingers, and armes, his legges, mouth, eyes, andwhole countenance, that it was a dreadfull sight to looke upon him,and whosoever beheld him, would verily have imagined, that hee wasutterly lame of his limbes, and greatly deformed in his body. Marquisoand Stechio, seeing all sorted so well as they could wish, tooke andled him towards the Church, making very pitious moane, and humblydesiring (for Gods sake) of every one that they met, to grant themfree passage: whereto they charitably condiscended.

　　Thus leading him on, crying; Beware there before, and give way forGods sake, they arrived at the body of Saint Arriguo, that (by hishelpe) he might be healed. And while all eyes were diligentlyobserving, what miracle would be wrought on Martellino, he havingsitten a small space upon the Saints body, and being sufficientlyskilfull in counterfeiting, began first to extend forth the one of hisfingers, next his hand, then his arme, and so (by degrees) the rest ofhis body. Which when the people saw, they made such a wonderfull noysein praise of Saint Arriguo, even as if it had thundered in the Church.

　　Now it chanced by ill fortune, that there stood a Florentine neereto the body, who knew Martellino very perfectly; but appearing somonstrously mishapen, when he was brought into the Church, hee couldtake no knowledge of him. But when he saw him stand up and walke,hee knew him then to be the man indeede; whereupon he saide. Howcommeth it to passe, that this fellow should be so miraculously cured,that never truly was any way impotent? Certaine men of the Cityhearing these words, entred into further questioning with him,demanding, how he knew that the man had no such imperfection? Wellenough (answered the Florentine) I know him to be as direct in hislimbes and body, as you; I, or any of us all are: but indeede, heknowes better how to dissemble counterfet trickes, then any man elsethat ever I saw.

　　When they heard this, they discoursed no further with theFlorentine, but pressed on mainely to the place where Martellinostood, crying out aloude. Lay hold on this Traytor, a mocker of God,and his holy Saints, that had no lamenesse in his limbes; but tomake a mocke of our Saint and us, came hither in false and counterfeitmanner. So laying hands uppon him, they threw him against theground, having him by the haire on his head, and tearing thegarments from his backe, spurning him with their feete, and beatinghim with their fists, that many were much ashamed to see it.

　　Poore Martellino was in a pittifull case, crying out for mercy,but no man would heare him; for, the more he cryed, the more stillthey did beat him, as meaning to leave no life in him: which Stechioand Marquiso seeing, considered with themselves, that they werelikewise in a desperate case; and therefore, fearing to be as muchmisused, they cryed out among the rest, Kill the counterfet knave, layon loade, and spare him not; neverthelesse, they tooke care how to gethim out of the peoples handes, as doubting, least they would killhim indeede, by their extreame violence.

　　Sodainly, Marquiso bethought him how to do it, and proceeded thus.All the Sergeants for Justice standing at the Church doore, hee ranwith all possible speede to the Potestates Lieutenant, and said untohim. Good my Lord Justice, helpe me in an hard case; yonder is avillaine that hath cut my purse, I desire he may bee brought beforeyou, that I may have my money againe. He hearing this, sent for adozen of the Sergeants, who went to apprehend unhappy Martellino,and recover him from the peoples fury, leading him on with them to thePalace, no meane crowds thronging after him, when they heard that hewas accused to bee a Cutpurse. Now durst they meddle no more with him,but assisted the Officers; some of them charging him in like manner,that hee had cut their purses also.

　　Upon these clamours and complaints, the Potestates Lieutenant (beinga man of rude quality) tooke him sodainly aside, and examined him ofthe crimes wherewith he was charged. But Martellino, as making noaccount of these accusations, laughed, and returned scoffing answeres.Whereat the Judge, waxing much displeased, delivered him over to theStrappado, and stood by himselfe, to have him confesse the crimesimposed on him, and then to hang him afterward. Being let downe to theground, the Judge still demaunded of him, whether the accusationsagainst him were true, or no? Affirming, that it nothing avayled himto deny it: whereupon hee thus spake to the Judge. My Lord, I am heereready before you, to confesse the truth; but I pray you, demaund ofall them that accuse me, when and where I did cut their purses, andthen I wil tell you that, which (as yet) I have not done, otherwiseI purpose to make you no more answers.Well (quoth the Judge) thou requirest but reason; and callingdivers of the accusers, one of them saide, that he lost his purseeight dayes before; another saide six, another foure, and some saidethe very same day. Which Martellino hearing, replyed. My Lord, theyall lie in their throats, as I will plainly prove before you. Iwould to God I had never set foot within this City, as it is notmany houres since my first entrance, and presently after minearrivall, I went (in evill houre I may say for me) to see the Saintsbody, where I was thus beaten as you may beholde. That all this istrue which I say unto you, the Seigneurie Officer that keeps yourBooke of presentations, will testifie for me, as also the Host where Iam lodged. Wherefore good my Lord, if you finde all no otherwise, thenas I have said, I humbly entreate you, that upon these bad mensreportes and false informations, I may not be thus tormented, andput in perill of my life.

　　While matters proceeded in this manner, Marquiso and Stechio,understanding how roughly the Potestates Lieutenant dealt withMartellino, and that he had already given him the Strappado; were inheavy perplexity, saying to themselves; we have carried this businessevery badly, redeeming him out of the Frying-pan, and flinging him intothe fire. Whereupon, trudging about from place to place, and meetingat length with their Host, they told him truly how all had happened,whereat hee could not refraine from laughing. Afterward, he wentwith them to one Master Alexander Agolante, who dwelt in Trevers,and was in great credite with the Cities cheefe Magistrate, to whomhee related the whole Discourse; all three earnestly entreating him,to commisserate the case of poore Martellino.

　　Master Alexander, after he had laughed heartily at this hottepeece of service, went with him to the Lord of Trevers; prevailingso well with him, that he sent to have Martellino brought beforehim. The Messengers that went for him, found him standing in his shirtbefore the Judge, very shrewdly shaken with the Strappado, tremblingand quaking pitifully. For the Judge would not heare any thing inhis excuse; but hating him (perhaps) because hee was a Florentine:flatly determined to have him hanged by the necke, and would notdeliver him to the Lord, untill in meere despight he was compeld to doit.The Lord of Trevers, when Martellino came before him, and hadacquainted him truly with every particular: Master Alexanderrequested, that he might be dispatched thence for Florence, because hethought the halter to be about his necke, and that there was noother helpe but hanging. The Lord, smiling (a long while) at theaccident, and causing Martellino to be handsomely apparrelled,delivering them also his Passe, they escaped out of further danger,and tarried no where, till they came unto Florence.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　WHEREBY WEE MAY LEARNE, THAT SUCH THINGS AS SOMETIME SEEME

　　HURTFULL TO US, MAY TURNE TO OUR BENEFIT AND COMMODITY

　　Rinaldo de Este, after hee was robbed by Theeves, arrived atChasteau Guillaume, where he was friendly lodged by a faire Widdow,and recompenced likewise for all his losses; returning afterwardsafe and well home unto his owne house.

　　Much merriment was among the Ladies, hearing this Tale ofMartellinos misfortunes, so familiarly reported by Madam Neiphila, andof the men, it was best respected by Philostratus, who sitting neerestunto Neiphila, the Queene commanded his Tale to be the next, whenpresently he began to speake thus.

　　Gracious Ladies, I am to speake of universall occasions, mingledwith some misfortunes in part, and partly with matters leaning tolove, as many times may happen to such people, that trace thedangerous pathes of amorous desires, or have not learned perfectly, tosay S. Julians pater noster, having good beddes of their owne, yetcasually meete with worser Lodging.

　　In the time of Azzo, Marquesse of Ferrara, there was a Marchantnamed Rinaldo de Este, who being one day at Bologna, about someespeciall businesse of his owne; his occasions there ended, and ridingfrom thence towards Verona, he fell in company with other Horsemen,seeming to be Merchants like himselfe, but indeede were Theeves, menof most badde life and conversation; yet he having no such mistrust ofthem, rode on, conferring with them very familiarly. They perceivinghim to be a Merchant, and likely to have some store of money abouthim, concluded betweene themselves to rob him, so soone as theyfound apt place and opportunity. But because he should conceive nosuch suspition, they rode on like modest men, talking honestly andfriendly with him, of good parts and disposition appearing in him,offering him all humble and gracious service, accounting themselveshappy by his companie, as hee returned the same courtesie to them,because hee was alone, and but one servant with him.

　　Falling from one discourse to another, they beganne to talke of suchprayers, as men (in journey) use to salute God withall; and one of theTheeves (they being three in number) spake thus to Rinaldo. Sir, letit be no offence to you, that I desire to know, what prayer you mostuse when thus you travell on the way? Whereto Rinaldo replyed inthis manner. To tell you true Sir, I am a man grosse enough in suchDivine matters, as medling more with Merchandize, then I do withBookes. Neverthelesse, at all times when I am thus in journey, inthe morning before I depart my Chamber, I say a Pater noster, and anAve Maria for the soules of the father and mother of Saint Julian; andafter that, I pray God and S. Julian to send me a good lodging atnight. And let me tell you Sir, that very oftentimes heeretofore, Ihave met with many great dangers upon the way, from all which Istill escaped, and evermore (when night drew on) I came to anexceeding good Lodging. Which makes mee firmely beleeve, that SaintJulian (in honour of whom I speake it) hath beggd of God such greatgrace for me; and mee thinkes, that if any day I should faile ofthis prayer in the morning: I cannot travaile securely, nor come toa good lodging. No doubt then Sir (quoth the other) but you have saidethat prayer this morning? I would be sory else, said Rinaldo, suchan especiall matter is not to be neglected.

　　He and the rest, who had already determined how to handle him beforethey parted, saide within themselves: Look thou hast said thypraier, for when we have thy money, Saint Julian and thou shift forthy lodging. Afterward, the same man thus againe conferd with him.As you Sir, so I have ridden many journies, and yet I never used anysuch prayer, although I have heard it very much commended, and mylodging hath proved never the worser. Perhaps this verie night willtherein resolve us both, whether of us two shall be the best lodged,you that have saide the Prayer, or I that never used it at all. ButI must not deny, that in sted thereof, I have made use of some verses;as Dirupisti, or the Intemerata, or De profundis, which are (as myGrandmother hath often told mee) of very great vertue and efficacy.

　　Continuing thus in talke of divers things, winning way, andbeguiling the time, still waiting when their purpose should sort toeffect: it fortuned, that the Theeves seeing they were come neere to aTowne, called Chasteau Guillaume, by the foord of a River, the houresomewhat late, the place solitarie, and thickely shaded with Trees,they made their assault; and having robd him, left him there on foote,stript into his shirt, saying to him. Goe now and see, whether thySaint Julian will allow thee this night a good lodging, or no, for ourowne we are sufficiently provided; so passing the River, away theyrode. Rinaldoes servant, seeing his Master so sharply assayled, like awicked villaine, would not assist him in any sort: but giving hishorse the spurres, never left gallopping, untill hee came toChasteau Guillaume, where hee entred upon the point of night,providing himselfe of a lodging, but not caring what became of hisMaster.

　　Rinaldo remaining there in his shirt, bare-foot and bare-legged,the weather extremely colde, and snowing incessantly, not knowing whatto doe, darke night drawing on, and looking round about him, forsome place where to abide that night, to the end he might not dye withcolde: he found no helpe at all there for him, in regard that (no longwhile before) the late warre had burnt and wasted all, and not so muchas the least Cottage left. Compelled by the coldes violence, his teethquaking, and all his body trembling, hee trotted on towardsChausteau Guillaume, not knowing, whether his man was gone thitheror no, or to what place else: but perswaded himselfe, that if he couldget entrance, there was no feare of finding succour. But before hecame within halfe a mile of the Towne, the night grew extreamelydarke, and arriving there so late, hee found the gates fast lockt, andthe Bridges drawne up, so that no entrance might be admitted.

　　Grieving greatly heereat, and being much discomforted, rufully heewent spying about the walls, for some place wherein to shrowdhimselfe, at least, to keepe the snow from falling upon him. By goodhap, hee espied an house upon the wall of the Towne, which had aterrace jutting out as a penthouse, under which he purposed to standall the night, and then to get him gone in the morning. At length, heefound a doore in the wall, but very fast shut, and some small store ofstrawe lying by it, which he gathered together, and sitting downethereon very pensively; made many sad complaints to Saint Julian,saying: This was not according to the trust he reposed in her. ButSaint Julian, taking compassion upon him, without any over-longtarying; provided him of a good lodging, as you shall heare how.

　　In this towne of Chasteau Guillaume, lived a young Lady, who was awiddow, so beautifull and comely of her person, as sildome was seene amore lovely creature. The Marquesse Azzo most dearely affected her,and (as his choysest Jewell of delight) gave her that house to livein, under the terrace whereof poore Rinaldo made his shelter. Itchaunced the day before, that the Marquesse was come thither,according to his frequent custome, to weare away that night in hercompany, she having secretly prepared a Bath for him, and a costlysupper beside. All things being ready, and nothing wanting but theMarquesse his presence: suddenly a Post brought him such Letters,which commanded him instantly to horsebacke, and word hee sent tothe Lady, to spare him for that night, because urgent occasions calledhim thence, and hee rode away immediately.

　　Much discontented was the Lady at this unexpected accident, andnot knowing now how to spend the time, resolved to use the Bathwhich shee had made for the Marquesse, and (after supper) betake herselfe to rest, and so she entred into the Bath. Close to the doorewhere poore Rinaldo sate, stoode the Bath, by which meanes, shee beingtherein, heard all his quivering moanes, and complaints, seeming to besuch, as the Swanne singing before her death: whereupon, shee calledher Chamber-maide, saying to her. Goe up above, and looke over theterrace on the wall downe to this doore, and see who is there, andwhat he doth. The Chamber-maide went up aloft, and by a littleglimmering in the ayre, she saw a man sitting in his shirt, bare onfeete and legges, trembling in manner before rehearsed. Shedemanding of whence, and what he was; Rinaldoes teeth so trembled inhis head, as very hardly could he forme any words, but (so well ashe could) told her what he was, and how he came thither: mostpittifully entreating her, that if she could affoord him any helpe,not to suffer him to starve there to death with cold.

　　The Chamber-maide, being much moved to compassion, returned to herLady, and tolde her all; she likewise pittying his distresse, andremembring shee had the key of that doore, whereby the Marquesseboth entred and returned, when he intended not to be seene of any,said to her Maide. Goe, and open the doore softly for him; we have agood supper, and none to helpe to eate it, and if he be a manlikely, we can allow him one nights lodging too. The Chamber-maide,commending her Lady for this charitable kindnesse, opened the doore,and seeing hee appeared as halfe frozen, shee said unto him. Make hastgood man, get thee into this Bath, which yet is good and warme, for myLady her selfe came but newly out of it. Whereto very gladly hecondiscended, as not tarrying to be bidden twise; finding himselfeso singularly comforted with the heate thereof, even as if hee hadbeene restored from death to life. Then the Lady sent him garments,which lately were her deceased husbands, and fitted him so aptly inall respects, as if purposely they had beene made for him.

　　Attending in further expectation, to know what else the Lady wouldcommaund him; hee began to remember God and Saint Julian, hartilythanking her, for delivering him from so bad a night as wasthreatned towards him, and bringing him to so good entertainment.After all this, the Lady causing a faire fire to be made in theneerest Chamber beneath, went and sate by it her selfe, demaunding howthe honest man fared. Madame, answered the Chamber-maide, now that heis in your deceased Lords garments, he appeareth to be a very goodlyGentleman, and (questionlesse) is of respective birth and breeding,well deserving this gracious favour which you have affoorded him.Goe then (quoth the Lady) and conduct him hither, to sit by this fire,and sup heere with mee, for I feare he hath had but a sorrie supper.When Rinaldo was entred into the Chamber, and beheld her to be sucha beautifull Lady, accounting his fortune to exceede all comparison,he did her most humble reverence, expressing so much thankefulnesse aspossibly he could, for this her extraordinary grace and favour.

　　The Lady fixing a stedfast eye upon him, well liking his gentlelanguage and behaviour, perceiving also, how fitly her deceasedhusbands apparell was formed to his person, and resembling him inall familiar respects, he appeared (in her judgement) farre beyond theChambermaides commendations of him; so praying him to sit downe by herbefore the fire, she questioned with him, concerning this unhappynights accident befalne him, wherein he fully resolved her, and sheewas the more perswaded, by reason of his servants comming into theTowne before night, assuring him, that he should be found for himearly in the morning.

　　Supper being served in to the Table, and hee seated according as theLady commanded; shee began to observe him very considerately; for hewas a goodly man, compleate in all perfection of person, a delicatepleasing countenance, a quicke alluring eye, fixed and constant, notwantonly gadding, in the joviall youthfulnesse of his time, and truesttemper for amorous apprehension; all these were as battering enginesagainst a Bulwarke of no strong resistance, and wrought strangely uponher flexible affections. And though shee fed heartily, as occasionconstrained, yet her thoughts had entertained a new kinde of diet,digested onely by the eye; yet so cunningly concealed, that nomotive to immodesty could be discerned. Her mercy thus extended to himin misery, drew on (by Table discourse) his birth, education, parents,friends, and alies; his wealthy possessions by Merchandize, and asound stability in his estate, but above all (and best of all) thesingle and sole condition of a batcheler; an apt and easie steele tostrike fire, especially upon such quicke taking tinder, and in atime favoured by Fortune.

　　No imbarment remained, but remembrance of the Marquesse, and thatbeing summoned to her more advised consideration, her youth and beautystood up as conscious accusers, for blemishing her honour and fairerepute, with lewd and luxurious life, far unfit for a Lady of herdegree, and well worthy of generall condemnation. What should Ifurther say? upon a short conference with her Chamber-maide,repentance for sinne past, and solemne promise of a constantconversion, thus shee delivered her minde to Rinaldo.

　　Sir, as you have related your Fortunes to mee, by this yourcasuall happening hither, if you can like the motion so well as sheethat makes it, my deceased Lord and Husband living so perfectly inyour person; this house, and all mine is yours; and of a widdow I willbecome your wife, except (unmanly) you deny me. Rinaldo hearingthese words, and proceeding from a Lady of such absoluteperfections, presuming upon so proud an offer, and condemning himselfeof folly if he should refuse it, thus replied. Madam, considering thatI stand bound for ever heereafter, to confesse that you are thegracious preserver of my life, and I no way able to returne requitall;if you please so to shadow mine insufficiencie, and to accept me andmy fairest fortunes to doe you service: let me die before a thought ofdeniall, or any way to yeeld you the least discontentment.

　　Heere wanted but a Priest to joyne their hands, as mutuall affectionalready had done their hearts, which being sealed with infinit kisses,the Chamber-maide called up Friar Roger her Confessor, and wedding andbedding were both effected before the bright morning. In breefe, theMarquesse having heard of the marriage, did not mislike it, butconfirmed it by great and honourable giftes; and having sent for hisdishonest Servant, he dispatched him (after sound reprehension) toFerrara, with Letters to Rinaldoes Father and Friends, of all theaccidents that had befalne him. Moreover, the very same morning, thethree Theeves that had robbed, and so ill intreated Rinaldo, foranother facte by them the same night committed, were taken, andbrought to the Towne of Chasteau Guillaume, where they were hanged fortheir offences, and Rinaldo with his wife rode to Ferrara.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED THE DANGERS OF PRODIGALITIE, AND

　　THE MANIFOLD MUTABILITIES OF FORTUNE

　　Three young Gentlemen, being Brethren, and having spent all theirLands and possessions vainely, became poore. A Nephew of theirs(falling almost into as desperate a condition) became acquaintedwith an Abbot, whom he afterward found to be the King of EnglandsDaughter, and made him her Husband in mariage, recompencing all hisUncles losses, and seating them againe in good estate.

　　The fortunes of Rinaldo de Este, being heard by the Ladies andGentlemen, they admired his happinesse, and commended his devotionto Saint Julian, who (in such extreame necessity) sent him so goodsuccour. Nor was the Lady to be blamed, for leaving base liberty,and converting to the chaste embraces of the marriage bed, the dignityof Womens honour, and eternall disgrace living otherwise. While thusthey descanted on the happy night betweene her and Rinaldo, MadamPampinea sitting next to Philostratus, considering, that her Discoursemust follow in order, and thinking on what shee was to say; the Queenehad no sooner sent out her command, but she being no lesse fairethen forward, began in this manner. Ladies of great respect, themore we conferre on the accidents of Fortune, so much the moreremaineth to consider on her mutabilities, wherein there is no need ofwonder, if discreetly we observe that al such things as we fondlytearme to be our owne, are in her power, and so (consequently)change from one to another, without any stay or arrest (according toher concealed judgement) or setled order (at least) that can beeknowne to us. Now, although these things appeare thus dayly to us,even apparantly in all occasions, and as hath beene discerned bysome of our precedent Discourses; yet notwithstanding, seeing itpleaseth the Queene, that our arguments should aime at these ends, Iwill adde to the former tales another of my owne, perhaps notunprofitable for the hearers, nor unpleasing in observation.

　　Sometime heeretofore, there dwelt in our Cittie, a Knight namedSignior Theobaldo, who (according as some report) issued from theFamily of Lamberti, but others derive him of the Agolanti; guiding(perhaps) their opinion heerein, more from the traine of Children,belonging to the saide Theobaldo (evermore equall to that of theAgolanti) then any other matter else. But setting aside from whichof these two houses he came, I say, that in his time he was a verywealthy Knight, and had three sonnes; the first being namedLamberto, the second Theobaldo, and the third Agolanto, all goodly andgracefull youths: howbeit, the eldest had not compleated eighteeneyeares, when Signior Theobaldo the Father deceased, who left themall his goods and inheritances. And they, seeing themselves rich inready monies and revennewes, without any other governement thentheir owne voluntary disposition, kept no restraint upon theirexpences, but maintained many servants, and store of unvalewableHorses, beside Hawkes and Hounds, with open house for all commers; andnot onely all delights else fit for Gentlemen, but what vanitiesbeside best agreed with their wanton and youthfull appetites.

　　Not long had they run on this race, but the Treasures lefte themby their Father, began greatly to diminish; and their Revennewessuffised not, to support such lavish expences as they had begun: butthey fell to engaging and pawning their inheritances, selling one today, and another to morrow, so that they saw themselves quickelycome to nothing, and then poverty opened their eyes, which prodigalityhad before clozed up. Heereupon, Lamberto (on a day) calling hisBrethren to him, shewed them what the honors of their Father hadbeene, to what height his wealth amounted, and now to what an ebbeof poverty it was falne, only thorow their inordinate expences.Wherefore hee counselled them, (as best he could) before furthermisery insulted over them, to make sale of the small remainder thatwas left, and then to betake themselves unto some other abiding, wherefairer Fortune might chance to shine uppon them.

　　This advice prevailed with them; and so, without taking leave of anybody, or other solemnity then closest secrecie, they departed fromFlorence, not tarrying in any place untill they were arrived inEngland. Comming to the City of London, and taking there a small houseupon yearely rent, living on so little charge as possibly might be,they began to lend out money at use: wherein Fortune was so favourableto them, that (in few yeares) they had gathered a great summe of mony:by means whereof it came to passe, that one while one of them, andafterward another, returned backe againe to Florence: where, withthose summes, a great part of their inheritances were redeemed, andmany other bought beside. Linking themselves in marriage, and yetcontinuing their usances in England; they sent a Nephew of theirsthither, named Alessandro, a yong man, and of faire demeanor, tomaintaine their stocke in employment: while they three remained stilin Florence, and growing forgetful of their former misery, fell againeinto as unreasonable expences as ever, never respecting their housholdcharges, because they had good credite among the Merchants, and themonies still sent from Alessandro, supporting their expences diversyeeres.

　　The dealings of Alessandro in England grew verie great, for hee lentout much money to many Gentlemen, Lords, and Barons of the Land,upon engagement of their Mannors; Castles, and other revennues: fromwhence he derived immeasurable benefite. While the three Brethren heldon in their lavish expences, borrowing moneys when they wanteduntill their supplies came from England, whereon (indeede) was theyronely dependance: it fortuned, that (contrary to the opinion of allmen) warre happened betweene the King of England, and one of hissonnes, which occasioned much trouble in the whole Countrey, by takingpart on either side, some with the sonne, and other with the Father.In regard whereof, those Castles and places pawned to Alessandro, weresodainely seized from him, nothing then remaining, that turned him anyprofite. But living in hope day by day, that peace would beconcluded betweene the Father and the Sonne, he never doubted, but allthings then should be restored to him, both the principall andinterest, and therfore he would not depart out of the Countrey.

　　The three Brethren at Florence, bounding within no limites theirdisordered spending; borrowed dayly more and more. And after somefew yeares, the creditors seeing no effect of their hopes to come fromthem, all credit being lost with them, and no repayment of promiseddues, they were imprisoned, their Landes and all they had, notsuffising to pay the moitie of Debts, but their bodies remained inprison for the rest, theyr Wives and young children being sent thence,some to one village, some to another, so that nothing now was to beexpected, but poverty and misery of life for ever. As for honestAlessandro, who had awaited long time for peace in England, perceyvingthere was no likelyhoode of it; and considering also, that (beside histarrying there in vaine to recover his dues) he was in danger of hislife; without any further deferring, he set away for Italy. It came topasse, that as he yssued foorth of Bruges, hee saw a young Abbotalso journeying thence, being cloathed in white, accompanied withdivers Monkes, and a great traine before, conducting the needfullCarriage. Two auncient Knights, kinsmen to the King, followed after;with whom Alessandro acquainted himselfe, as having formerly knownthem, and was kindely accepted into their company. Alessandro ridingalong with them, courteously requested to know, what those Monkswere that rode before, and such a traine attending on them? Wheretoone of the Knights thus answered.

　　He that rideth before, is a yong Gentleman, and our Kinsman, whois newly elected Abbot of one of the best Abbeys in England, andbecause he is more yong in yeeres, then the decrees for such a dignitydo allow, we travaile with him to Rome, to entreat our Holy Father,that his.youth may be dispensed withall, and he confirmed in thesaid dignitie; but hee is not to speake a word to any person. Onrode this new Abbot, sometimes before his Traine, and other whilesafter, as we see great Lords use to do, when they ride upon theHigh-wayes.

　　It chanced on a day, that Alessandro rode somewhat neere to theAbbot, who stedfastly beholding him, perceived that he was a verycomely young man, so affable, lovely, and gracious, that even inthis first encounter, he had never seene any man before that betterpleased him. Calling him a little closer, he began to conferrefamiliarly with him, demanding what he was, whence he came, andwhether he travelled. Alessandro imparted freely to him all hisaffaires, in every thing satisfying his demands, and offering(although his power was small) to doe him all the service he could.

　　When the Abbot had heard his gentle answeres, so wisely anddiscreetly delivered, considering also (more particularly) hiscommendable carriage, hee tooke him to be (at the least) awell-borne Gentleman, and far differing from his owne logger headedtraine. Wherefore, taking compassion on his great misfortunes, hecomforted him very kindly, wishing him to live alwayes in good hope.For, if he were vertuous and honest, he should surely attaine to theseate from whence Fortune had throwne him, or rather much higher.Intreating him also, that seeing he journied towards Tuscany, as hehimselfe did the like, to continue stil (if he pleased) in hiscompany. Alessandro most humbly thanked him for such gracious comfort;protesting, that he would be alwaies readie to do whatsoever hecommanded.

　　The Abbot riding on, with newer crotchets in his braine then hehad before the sight of Alessandro, it fortuned, that after diversdayes of travaile, they came to a small Country Village, whichaffoorded little store of Lodging, and yet the Abbot would needeslye there. Alessandro, being well acquainted with the Hoste of thehouse, willed him to provide for the Abbot and his people, and then tolodge him where hee thought it meetest. Now before the Abbotscomming thither, the Harbenger that marshalled all such matters, hadprovided for his Traine in the Village, some in one place, andothers elsewhere, in the best maner that the Towne could yeelde. Butwhen the Abbot had supt, a great part of the night being spent, andevery one else at his rest; Alessandro demaunded of the Hoste, whatprovision he had made for him, and how hee should be lodged thatnight?

　　In good sadnesse Sir (quoth the Host) you see that my house isfull of Guests, so that I and my people, must gladly sleepe on thetables and benches: Neverthelesse, next adjoyning to my Lord AbbotsChamber, there are certaine Corn-lofts, whether I can closely bringyou, and making shift there with a slender Pallet-bed, it may servefor one night, insted of a better. But mine Host (quoth Alessandro)how can I passe thorow my Lords Chamber, which is so little, as itwould not allow Lodging for any of his Monkes? If I had remembred somuch (said the Host) before the Curtaines were drawne, I could havelodged his Monkes in the Corne-lofts, and then both you and I mighthave slept where now they doe. But feare you not, my Lords Curtainesare close drawne, hee sleepeth (no doubt) soundly, and I canconveigh you thither quietly enough, without the least disturbanceto him, and a Pallet-bed shall be fitted there for you. Alessandroperceiving that all this might be easily done, and no diseaseoffered to the Abbot, accepted it willingly, and went thitherwithout any noyse at all.

　　My Lord Abbot, whose thoughts were so busied about amorousdesires, that no sleepe at all could enter his eyes, heard all thistalke between the Host and Alessandro, and also where hee wasappointed to Lodge, he saide thus within himselfe. Seeing Fortune hathfitted me with a propitious time, to compasse the happinesse of myhearts desire; I know no reason why I should refuse it. Perhaps, Ishall never have the like offer againe, or ever be enabled with suchan opportunitie. So, beeing fully determined to prosecute hisintention, and perswading himself also, that the silence of thenight had bestowed sleepe on all the rest; with a lowe and tremblingvoyce, he called Alessandro, advising him to come and lye downe byhim, which (after some few faint excuses) he did, and putting offhis cloaths, lay downe by the Abbot, being not a little proude of sogracious a favour.

　　The Abbot, laying his arme over the others body, began to imbraceand hugge him; even as amorous friends (provoked by earnestaffection), use to doe. Whereat Alessandro verie much mervayling,and being an Italian himselfe, fearing least this folly in theAbbot, would convert to foule and dishonest action, shrunke modestlyfrom him. Which the Abbot perceiving, and doubting least Alessandrowould depart and leave him, pleasantly smiling, and with bashfullbehaviour baring his stomack, he tooke Alessandroes hand, and layingit thereon, saide; Alessandro, let all bad thoughts of bestiallabuse be farre off from thee, and feele here, to resolve thee from allsuch feare. Allessandro feeling the Abbots brest, found there twopretty little mountaines, round, plumpe, and smooth, appearing as ifthey had beene of polished Ivory; whereby he perceived, that the Abbotwas a woman: which, setting an edge on his youthful desires, madehim fall to embracing, and immediately he offered to kisse her; butshe somewhat rudely repulsing him, as halfe offended, saide.

　　Alessandro, forbeare such boldnesse, uppon thy lives perill, andbefore thou further presume to touch me, understand what I shalltell thee. I am (as thou perceivest) no man, but a woman; anddeparting a Virgin from my Fathers House, am travelling towards thePopes holinesse, to the end that he should bestow me in marriage.But the other day, when first I beheld thee, whether it proceeded fromthy happinesse in fortune, or the fatall houre of my owne infelicityfor ever, I know not; I conceyved such an effectuall kinde of likingtowardes thee, as never did Woman love a man more truely then I doethee having sworn within my soule to make thee my Husband before anyother; and if thou wilt not accept me as thy wife, set a locke uponthy lippes concerning what thou hast heard, and depart hence tothine owne bed againe.

　　No doubt, but that these were strange newes to Alessandro, andseemed meerely as a miracle to him. What shee was, he knew not, but inregard of her traine and company, hee reputed her to be both noble andrich, as also she was wonderfull faire and beautifull. His ownefortunes stood out of future expectation by his kinsmens overthrow,and his great losses in England; wherefore, upon an opportunity sofairely offered, he held it no wisedome to returne refusall, butaccepted her gracious motion, and referred all to her disposing.Shee arising out of her bed, called him to a little Table standing by,where hung a faire Crucifixe upon the wall; before which, andcalling him to witnesse, that suffered such bitter and cruell tormentson his Crosse, putting a Ring upon his finger, there she faithfullyespoused him, refusing all the world, to be onely his: which beingon either side confirmed solemnly, by an holy Vow, and chastekisses; shee commanded him backe to his Chamber, and she returned toher bed againe, sufficiently satisfied with her Loves acceptation, andso they journied on till they came to Rome.

　　When they had rested themselves there for some few dayes, thesupposed Abbot, with the two Knights, and none else in company butAlessandro, went before the Pope, and having done him such reverenceas beseemed, the Abbot began to speake in this manner.

　　Holy Father (as you know much better then any other) everie one thatdesireth to live well and vertuously, ought to shunne (so farre asin them lyeth) all occasions that may induce to the contrarie. Tothe end therefore, that I (who desire nothing more) then to livewithin the compasse of a vertuous conversation, may perfect my hopesin this behalfe: I have fled from my Fathers Court, and am come hitherin this habite as you see, to crave therein your holy and fatherlyfurtherance. I am daughter to the King of England, and havesufficiently furnished my selfe with some of his Treasures, thatyour Holinesse may bestow me in marriage; because mine unkindFather, never regarding my youth and beauty (inferior to few in mynative country) would marry me to the King of North-Wales, an aged,impotent, and sickely man. Yet let me tell your sanctity, that his ageand weakenesse hath not so much occasioned my Right, as feare ofmine owne youth and frailety; when being married to him, instead ofloyall and unstained life, lewd and dishonest desires might make me towander, by breaking the divine Lawes of wedlocke, and abusing theroyall blood of my Father.

　　As I travailed hither with this vertuous intention, our Lord, whoonely knoweth perfectly, what is best fitting for all his creatures;presented mine eyes (no doubt in his meere mercy and goodnesse) with aman meete to be my husband, which (pointing to Alessandro) is thisyoung Gentleman standing by me, whose honest, vertuous, and civilldemeanour, deserveth a Lady of farre greater worth, although (perhaps)Nobility in blood be denied him, and may make him seeme not soexcellent, as one derived from Royall discent. Holy and religiousvowes have past betweene us both, and the Ring on his finger, is thefirme pledge of my faith and constancie, never to accept any other manin marriage, but him onely, although my Father, or any else doedislike it. Wherefore (holy Father) the principall cause of my comminghither, being already effectually concluded on, I desire to compleatthe rest of my Pilgrimage, by visiting the sanctified places in thisCity, whereof there are great plenty: And also, that sacredmarriage, being contracted in the presence of God onely, betweeneAlessandro and my selfe, may by you be publikely confirmed, and inan open congregation. For, seeing God hath so appointed it, and oursoules have so solemnely vowed it, that no disaster whatsoever canalter it: you being Gods Vicar here on earth, I hope will notgainesay, but confirme it with your fatherly benediction, that wee maylive in Gods feare, and dye in his favour.

　　Perswade your selves (faire Ladies) that Alessandro was in nomeane admiration, when hee heard, that his wife was daughter to theKing of England, unspeakable joy (questionlesse) wholly overcamehim: but the two Knights were not a little troubled and offended, atsuch a straunge and unexpected accident, yea, so violent were theirpassions, that had they beene any where else, then in the Popespresence, Alessandro had felt their furie, and (perhaps) the Princesseher selfe too. On the other side, the Pope was much amazed at thehabite she went disguised in, and likewise at the election of herhusband; but, perceiving there was no resistance to be made againstit, hee yeelded the more willingly to satisfie her desire. Andtherefore, having first comforted the two Knights, and made peacebetweene them, the Princesse, and Alessandro, he gave order for therest that was to be done.

　　When the appointed day for the solemnity was come, hee caused thePrincesse (cloathed in most rich and royall garments) to appearebefore all the Cardinals, and many other great persons then inpresence, who were come to this worthy Feast, which hee had causedpurposely to bee prepared, where she seemed so faire and goodly aLady, that every eye was highly delighted to behold her, commendingher with no meane admiration. In like manner was Alessandro greatlyhonoured by the two Knights, being most sumptuous in appearance, andnot like a man that had lent money to usury, but rather of very royallquality; the Pope himselfe celebrating the marriage betweene them,which being finished, with the most magnificent pompe that could bedevised, hee gave them his benediction, and licenced their departurethence.

　　Alessandro, his Princesse and her traine thus leaving Rome, theywould needes visite Florence, where the newes of this accident was(long before) noysed, and they received by the Citizens in royallmanner. There did shee deliver the three brethren out of prison,having first payed all their debts, and reseated them againe (withtheir wives) in their former inheritances and possessions.Afterward, departing from Florence, and Agolanto, one of the Unclestravailing with them to Paris; they were there also most honourablyentertained by the King of France. From whence the two Knights wentbefore for England, and prevailed so successefully with the King; thathee received his daughter into grace and favour, as also his Sonnein law her husband, to whom hee gave the order of Knighthoode, and(for his greater dignitie) created him Earle of Cornewall.

　　And such was the noble spirit of Alessandro, that he pacified thetroubles betweene the King and his sonne, whereon ensued great comfortto the Kingdome, winning the love and favour of all the people; andAgolanto (by the meanes of Alessandro) recovered all that was due tohim and his brethren in England, returning richly home to Florence,Count Alessandro (his kinsman) having first dub'd him Knight. Longtime he lived in peace and tranquility, with the faire Princesse hiswife, proving to be so absolute in wisedome, and so famous a Souldier;that (as some report) by assistance of his Father in law, he conqueredthe Realme of Ireland, and was crowned King thereof.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　WHEREBY MAY BE DISCERNED, INTO HOW MANY DANGERS A MAN MAY

　　FALL, THROUGH A COVETOUS DESIRE TO ENRICH HIMSELFE

　　Landolpho Ruffolo, falling into poverty, became a Pirate on theSeas, and being taken by the Genewayes, hardly escaped drowning: Whichyet (neverthelesse) he did, upon a little Chest or Coffer, full ofvery rich Jewels, being carried thereon to Corfu, where he was wellentertained by a good woman; And afterward, returned richly home tohis owne house.

　　Madam Lauretta, sitting next to Madam Pampinea, and seeing howtriumphantly she had finished her discourse; without attending anything else, spake thus. Gracious Ladies, we shall never behold (inmine opinion) a greater act of Fortune, then to see a man so suddainlyexalted, even from the lowest depth of poverty, to a Royall estateof dignity; as the discourse of Madam Pampinea hath made good, bythe happy advancement of Alessandro. And because it appearethnecessary, that whosoever discourseth on the subject proposed,should no way vary from the very same termes; I shall not shame totell a tale, which, though it containe far greater mishapes then theformer, may sort to as happy an issue, albeit not so noble andmagnificent. In which respect, it may (perhaps) merit the lesseattention; but howsoever that fault shall be found in you, I meaneto discharge mine owne duty.

　　Opinion hath made it famous for long time, that the Seacoast ofRhegium to Gaieta, is the onely delactable part of all Italy, wherein,somewhat neere to Salerno, is a shore looking upon the Sea, whichthe inhabitants there dwelling, doe call the coast of Malfy, full ofsmall Townes, Gardens, Springs, and wealthy men, trading in as manykindes of Merchandizes, as any other people that I know. Among whichTownes, there is one, named Ravello, wherein (as yet to this day thereare rich people) there was (not long since) a very wealthy man,named Landolpho Ruffolo, who being not contented with his riches,but coveting to multiply them double and trebble, fell in danger, toloose both himselfe and wealth together. This man (as otherMerchants are wont to doe) after hee had considered on his affaires,bought him a very goodly Ship, lading it with divers sorts ofMerchandizes, all belonging to himselfe onely, and making his voyageto the Isle of Cyprus. Where he found, over and beside theMerchandizes he had brought thither, many Ships more there arrived,and all laden with the same commodities, in regard whereof, it wasneedefull for him, not onely to make a good Mart of his goods; butalso was further constrained (if hee meant to vent his commodities) tosell them away (almost) for nothing, endangering his utter destructionand overthrow. Whereupon, grieving exceedingly at so great a losse,not knowing what to doe, and seeing, that from very aboundantwealth, hee was likely to fall into as low poverty: he resolved todie, or to recompence his losses upon others, because he would notreturne home poore, having departed thence so rich.

　　Meeting with a Merchant, that bought his great Ship of him; with themoney made thereof, and also his other Merchandizes, hee purchasedanother, being a lighter vessell, apt and proper for the use of aPirate, arming and furnishing it in ample manner, for roving androbbing upon the Seas. Thus hee began to make other mens goods hisowne, especially from the Turkes he tooke much wealth, Fortune beingalwayes therein so favourable to him, that hee could never compassethe like by trading. So that, within the space of one yeare, hee hadrobd and taken so many Gallies from the Turke; that he foundhimselfe well recovered, not onely of all his losses by Merchandize,but likewise his wealth was wholly redoubled. Finding his losses to bevery liberally requited, and having now sufficient, it were folly tohazard a second fall; wherefore, conferring with his owne thoughts,and finding that he had enough, and needed not to covet after more: hefully concluded, now to returne home to his owne house againe, andlive upon his goods thus gotten.

　　Continuing still in feare of the losses he had sustained bytraffique, and minding never more to imploy his money that way, but tokeep this light vessell, which had holpen him to all his wealth: hecommanded his men to put forth their Oares, and shape,their course forhis owne dwelling. Being aloft in the higher Seas, darke nightover-taking them, and a mighty winde suddainly comming upon them: itnot onely was contrary to their course, but held on with suchimpetuous violence; that the small vessell, being unable to endure it,made to land-ward speedily, and in expectation of a more friendlywind, entred a little port of the Sea, directing up into a smallIsland, and there safely sheltred it selfe. Into the same port whichLandolpho had thus taken for his refuge, entred (soone after) twogreat Carrackes of Genewayes, lately come from Constantinople. Whenthe men in them had espied the small Barke, and lockt up her passagefrom getting forth; understanding the Owners name, and that report hadfamed him to be very rich, they determined (as men evermore addictednaturally, to covet after money and spoile) to make it their owne as aprize at Sea.

　　Landing some store of their men, well armed with Crossebowes andother weapons, they tooke possession of such a place, where none durstissue forth of the small Barke, but endangered his life with theirDarts and Arrowes. Entering aboord the Barke, and making it their owneby full possession, all the men they threw over-boord, without sparingany but Landolpho himselfe, whom they mounted into one of theCarrackes, leaving him nothing but a poore shirt of Maile on hisbacke, and having rifled the Barke of all her riches, sunke it intothe bottome of the sea. The day following, the rough windes beingcalmed, the Carrackes set saile againe, having a prosperous passageall the day long; but upon the entrance of darke night, the windesblew more tempestuously then before, and sweld the Sea in such rudestormes, that the two Carracks were sundered each from other, and byviolence of the tempest it came to passe, that the Carracke whereinlay poore miserable Landolpho (beneath the Isle of Cephalonia) ranagainst a rocke, and even as a glasse against a wall, so split theCarracke in peeces, the goods and merchandize floating on the Sea,Chests, Coffers, Beds, and such like other things, as often hapneth insuch lamentable accidents.

　　Now, notwithstanding the nights obscurity, and impetuous violence ofthe billowes; such as could swimme, made shift to save their livesby swimming. Others caught hold on such things, as by Fortunes favour,floated neerest to them, among whom, distressed Landolpho, desirous tosave his life, if possibly it might be, espied a Chest or Cofferbefore him, ordained (no doubt) to be the meanes of his safety fromdrowning. Now although the day before, he had wished for deathinfinite times, rather then to returne home in such wretchedpoverty; yet, seeing how other men strove for safety of their lives byany helpe, were it never so little, bee tooke advantage of this favouroffred him, and the rather in a necessitie so urgent. Keeping fastupon the Coffer so well as he could, and being driven by the winds andwaves, one while this way, and anon quite contrary, he made shiftfor himselfe till day appeared; when looking every way about him,seeing nothing but clouds, the seas and the Coffer, which one whileshrunke from under him, and another while supported him, accordingas the windes and billowes carried it: all that day and night thushe floated up and downe, drinking more then willingly hee would, butalmost hunger-starved thorow want of foode. The next morning, eitherby the appointment of heaven or power of the Windes, Landolpho who was(well-neere) become a Spundge, holding his armes strongly about theChest, as we have seene some doe, who (dreading drowning) take hold onany the very smallest helpe; drew neere unto the shore of the IlandCorfu, where (by good fortune) a poore woman was scowring disheswith the salt water and sand, to make them (housewife like) neateand cleane.

　　When shee saw the Chest drawing neere her, and not discerning theshape of any man, shee grew fearefull, and retyring from it, cried outaloude. He had no power of speaking to her, neither did his sightdoe him the smallest service; but even as the waves and windespleased, the Chest was driven still neerer to the Land, and then thewoman perceyved that it had the forme of a ofer, and looking moreadvisedly, beheld two armes extended over it, and afterward, sheespied the face of a man, not being able to judge, whether he werealive, or no. Moved by charitable and womanly compassion, shee steptin among the billowes, and getting fast holde on the hayre of hishead, drew both the Chest and him to the Land, and calling forth herDaughters to helpe her, with much adoe she unfolded his armes from theChest, setting it up on her Daughters head, and then betweene them,Landolpho was led into the Towne, and there conveyed into a warmeStove, where quickly he recovered by her pains, his strengthbenummed with extreame cold.

　　Good wines and comfortable broathes shee cherished him withall, thathis sences being indifferently restored, hee knew the place wherehee was; but not in what manner he was brought thither, till thegood woman shewed him the Cofer that had kept him floating upon thewaves, and (next under God) had saved his life. The Chest seemed ofsuch slender weight, that nothing of any value could be expected init, either to recompence the womans great paines and kindnessebestowne on him, or any matter of his owne benefit. Neverthelesse, thewoman being absent, he opened the Chest, and found innumerableprecious stones therein, some costly and curiously set in Gold, andothers not fixed in any mettall. Having knowledge of their great worthand value (being a Merchant, and skil'd in such matters) he becamemuch comforted, praysing God for this good successe, and such anadmirable meanes of deliverance from danger.

　　Then considering with himselfe, that (in a short time) hee had beenetwice well buffeted and beaten by Fortune, and fearing, least athird mishap might follow in like manner, hee consulted with histhoughts, how he might safest order the businesse, and bring so rich abooty (without perill) to his owne home. Wherefore, wrapping up thejewels in very unsightly coloures, that no suspition at all shouldbe conceived of them, hee saide to the good woman, that the Chestwould not doe him any further service; but if shee pleased to lendehim a small sacke or bagge, shee might keepe the Cofer, for in herhouse it would divers way stead her. The woman gladly did as hedesired, and Landolpho returning her infinite thankes, for theloving kindnesse shee had affoorded him, throwing the sacke on hisnecke, passed by a Barke to Brundusiam, and from thence to Tranium,where Merchants in the City bestowed good garments on him, heacquainting them with his disasterous fortunes, but not a wordconcerning his last good successe.

　　Being come home in safety to Ravello, he fell on his knees, andthanked God for all his mercies towards him. Then opening the sacke,and viewing the jewels at more leysure then formerly he had done, hefound them to be of so great estimation, that selling them but atordinary and reasonable rates, he was three times richer, then whenhee departed first from his house. And having vented them all, he senta great summe of money to the good woman at Corfu, that had rescuedhim out of the Sea, and saved his life in a danger so dreadfull. Thelike he did to Tranium, to the Merchants that had newly cloathedhim; living richly upon the remainder, and never adventuring more tothe Sea, but ended his dayes in wealth and honour.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　COMPREHENDING, HOW NEEDFULL A THING IT IS, FOR A MAN THAT

　　TRAVELLETH IN AFFAIRES OF THE WORLD, TO BE PROVIDENT AND

　　WELL ADVISED, AND CAREFULLY TO KEEPE HIMSELFE FROM THE

　　CRAFTY AND DECEITFULL ALLUREMENTS OF STRUMPETS

　　Andrea de Piero, travelling from Perouse to Naples to buy Horses,was (in the space of one night) surprised by three admirableaccidents, out of all which he fortunately escaped, and with a richRing, returned home to his owne house.

　　The precious Stones and jewels found by Landolpho, maketh mee toremember (said Madam Fiammetta, who was next to deliver her discourse)a Tale, containing no lesse perils, then that reported by MadamLauretta: but somewhat different from it, because the one happenedin sundry yeeres, and this other had no longer time, then the compasseof one poore night, as instantly I will relate unto you.

　　As I have heard reported by many, there sometime lived in Perouse orPerugia, a young man, named Andrea de Piero, whose profession was totrade about Horses, in the nature of a Horse-courser, orHorsemaster, who hearing of a good Faire or Market (for his purpose)at Naples, did put five hundred Crownes of gold in his purse, andjourneyed thither in the company of other Horse-coursers, arrivingthere on a Sunday in the evening. According to instructions givenhim by his Host, he went the next day into the Horse-market, wherehe saw very many Horses that he liked, cheapening their prices as hewent up and downe, but could fall to no agreement; yet to manifestthat he came purposely to buy, and not as a cheapener onely,oftentimes (like a shallow-brainde trader in the world) he shewedhis purse of gold before all passengers, never respecting who, or whatthey were that observed his follie.

　　It came to passe, that a young Sicillian wench (very beautifull, butat commaund of whosoever would, and for small hire) pass then by,and (without his percieving) seeing such store of gold in his purse;presently she said to her selfe: why should not all those crownes bemine, when the foole that owes them, can keepe them no closer? Andso she went on. With this young wanton there was (at the same time) anolde woman (as commonly such stuffe is alwayes so attended) seeming tobe a Sicillian also, who so soone as shee saw Andrea, knew him, andleaving her youthfull commodity, ranne to him, and embraced him verykindly. Which when the younger Lasse perceived, without proceeding anyfurther, she stayed to see what would ensue thereon. Andrea conferringwith the olde Bawde, and knowing her (but not for any such creature)declared himselfe very affable to her; she making him promise, thatshee would come and drinke with him at his lodging. So breaking offfurther speeches for that time, shee returned to her youngCammerado; and Andrea went about buying his horses, still cheapninggood store, but did not buy any all that morning.

　　The Punke that had taken notice of Andreas purse, upon the oldewomans comming backe to her (having formerly studied, how shee mightget all the gold, or the greater part thereof) cunningly questionedwith her, what the man was, whence hee came, and the occasion of hisbusinesse there? wherein she fully informed her particularly, and inas ample manner as himselfe could have done: That shee had long timedwelt in Sicily with his Father, and afterward at Perouse;recounting also, at what time she came thence, and the cause which nowhad drawne him to Naples. The witty young housewife, being thorowlyinstructed, concerning the Parents and kindred of Andrea, their names,quality, and all other circumstances thereto leading; began to framethe foundation of her purpose thereupon, setting her resolutiondowne constantly, that the purse and gold was (already) more thanhalfe her owne.

　　Being come home to her owne house, away shee sent the olde Pandresseabout other businesse, which might hold her time long enough ofemployment, and hinder her returning to Andrea according to promise,purposing, not to trust her in this serious piece of service.Calling a young crafty Girle to her, whom she had well tutoured in thelike ambassages, when evening drew on, she sent her to Andreaslodging, where (by good fortune) she found him sitting alone at thedoore, and demanding of him, if he knew an honest Gentleman lodgingthere, whose name was Signior Andrea de Piero; he made her answere,that himselfe was the man. Then taking him aside, she said. Sir, thereis a worthy Gentlewoman of this Citie, that would gladly speake withyou, if you pleased to vouchsafe her so much favour.

　　Andrea, hearing such a kinde of salutation, and from aGentlewoman, named of worth; began to grow proud in his owneimaginations, and to make no meane estimation of himselfe: As(undoubtedly) that he was an hansome proper man, and of such cariageand perfections, as had attracted the amorous eye of this Gentlewoman,and induced her to like and love him beyond all other, Naples notcontaining a man of better merit. Whereupon he answered the Mayde,that he was ready to attend her Mistresse, desiring to know, when itshould be, and where the Gentlewoman would speake with him? So sooneas you please Sir, replied the Damosell, for she tarrieth your commingin her owne house.

　　Instantly Andrea (without leaving any direction of his departurein his lodging, or when he intended to returne againe) said to theGirle: Goe before, and I will follow. This little Chamber-commodity,conducted him to her Mistresses dwelling, which was in a streete namedMalpertuis, a title manifesting sufficiently the streetes honesty: buthee, having no such knowledge thereof, neither suspecting any harme atall, but that he went to a most honest house, and to a Gentlewomanof good respect; entred boldly: the Mayde going in before, and guidinghim up a faire payre of stayres, which he having more then halfeascended, the cunning young Queane gave a call to her Mistresse,saying; Signior Andrea is come already, whereupon, she appeared at thestayres-head, as if she had stayed there purposely to entertainehim. She was young, very beautifull, comely of person, and rich inadornements, which Andrea well observing, and seeing her descend twoor three steps, with open armes to embrace him, catching fast holdabout his neck; he stood as a man confounded with admiration, andshe contained a cunning kinde of silence, even as if she were unableto utter one word, seeming hindered by extremity of joy at hispresence, and to make him effectually admire her extraordinarykindnesse, having teares plenteously at commaund, intermixed withsighes and broken speeches, at last, thus she spake.

　　Signior Andrea, you are the most welcome friend to me in theworld; sealing this salutation with infinite sweet kisses andembraces: whereat (in wonderfull amazement) he being strangelytransported, replied; Madame, you honour me beyond all compasse ofmerit. Then, taking him by the hand, shee guided him thorough a goodlyHall, into her owne Chamber, which was delicately embalmed with Roses,Orenge flowers, and all other pleasing smelles, and a costly bed inthe middest, curtained round about, verie artificiall Picturesbeautifying the walles, with many other embellishments, such asthose Countries are liberally stored withall. He being meerely anovice in these kinds of wanton carriages of the World, and freefrom any base or degenerate conceite; firmely perswaded himselfe, that(questionlesse) she was a Lady of no meane esteeme, and he more thenhappy, to be thus respected and honored by her. They both being seatedon a curious Chest at the beds feete, teares cunningly trickling downeher Cheekes, and sighes intermedled with inward sobbings, breathedfoorth in sad, but verie seemely manner, thus shee beganne.

　　I am sure Andrea, that you greatly marvell at me, in gracing youwith this solemne and kinde entertainment, and why I should so melt myselfe in sighes and teares, at a man that hath no knowledge of mee, orperhaps, sildome or never heard any speeches of mee: but you shallinstantly receive from mee matter to augment your greater marvaile,meeting heere with your owne Sister, beyond all hope or expectation ineyther of us both. But seeing that Heaven hath beene so gracious tome, to let mee see one of my Brethren before I dye (though gladly Iwould have seene them all) which is some addition of comfort to me,and that which (happily) thou hast never heard before, in plaine andtruest manner, I will reveale unto thee.

　　Piero, my Father and thine, dwelt long time (as thou canst notchoose but to have understood) in Palermo; where, through thebounty, and other gracious good parts remaining in him, he was muchrenowned, and to this day, is no doubt remembred, by many of hisloving Friends and Wellwillers. Among them that most intimatelyaffected Piero, my mother (who was Gentlewoman, and at that time awidow) did deerest of all other love him; so that: forgetting thefeare of her Father, Brethren, yea, and her owne honour, they becameso privately acquainted, that I was begotten, and am heere now such asthou seest me. Afterward, occasions so befalling our Father, toabandon Palermo, and returne to Perouse, he left my mother and mehis little daughter, never after (for ought that I could learne)once remembring either her or me: so that (if he had not beene myFather) I could have much condemned him, in regard of hisingratitude to my mother, and love which hee ought to have shewne meas his childe, being borne of no Chamber-maide, neyther of a Cittysinner; albeit I must needes say, that she was blame-worthy, withoutany further knowledge of him (rioved onely thereto by most loyalaffection) to commit both her selfe, and all the wealth shee had, intohis hands: but things ill done, and so long time since, are moreeasily controulled, then amended.Being left so young at Palermo, and growing (well neere) to thestature as now you see me; my Mother (being wealthy) gave me inmarriage to one of the Gergentes Family, a Gentleman, and of greatrevennues, who in his love to me and my mother, went and dwelt atPalermo: where falling into the Guelphes Faction, and making one inthe enterprize with Charles our King; it came to passe, that they werediscovered to Fredericke King of Arragon, before their intent could beput in execution: Whereupon, we were enforced to flye from Sicily,even when my hope stoode fairely, to have beene the greatest Lady inall the Island. Packing up then such few things as wee could take withus, (few I may well call them, in regard of our wealthy possessions,both in Pallaces, Houses, and Lands, all which we were constrainedto forgo:) we made our recourse to this Citty, where we found KingCharles so benigne and gracious to us, that recompencing the greaterpart of our losses, he bestowed Lands and houses on us here, besidea continuall large pension to my husband your brother in Law, asheereafter himselfe shall better acquaint you withal. Thus came Ihither, and thus remaine here, where I am able to welcome my brotherAndrea, thankes more to Fortune, then any friendlinesse in him. Withwhich words she embraced and kissed him many times, sighing andweeping as she did before.Andrea hearing this Fable so artificially delivered, composed frompoint to point with such likely protestations, without faltring orfailing in any one words utterance; and remembring perfectly fortruth, that his Father had formerly dwelt at Palermo; knowing also (bysome sensible feeling in himselfe) the custome of young people, whoare easily conquered by affection in their youthfull heate, seeingbeside the tears, trembling speeches, and earnest embracings of thiscunning commodity; he tooke all to be true by her thus spoken, andupon her silence, thus replyed. Lady, let it not seeme strange to you,that your words have raysed marvell in me, because (indeed) I had noknowledge of you, even no more then as if I had never seene you: neveralso having heard my father speak either of you or your mother (forsome considerations best known unto himselfe:) or if at any time heused such language, either my youth then, or defective memory since,hath utterly lost it. But truely, it is no little joy and comfort tome, to finde a sister here, where I had no such hope or expectation,and where also myselfe am a meere stranger. For to speake my mindefreely of you, and the perfections gracefully appearing in you Iknow not any man of how great repute or qualitie soever, but you maywell beseeme his acceptance, much rather then mine, that am but a meanMerchant. But faire Sister, I desire to be resolved in one thing, towit; by what means you had understanding of my being in this City?whereto readily she returned him this answer.

　　Brother, a poore Woman of this City, whom I employ sometimeshoushold occasions, came to mee this morning, and (having seene you)tolde me, that shee dwelt a long while with our Father, both atPalermo and Perouse. And because I held it much better beseeming mycondition, to have you visite me in mine owne dwelling, then I to comesee you at a common Inne, I made the bolder to send for you hither.After which words, in very orderly manner, she enquired of hischiefest kindred and friends, calling them readily by their propernames, according to her former instructions. Whereto Andrea still madeher answere, confirming thereby his beliefe of her the morestrongly, and crediting whatsoever she saide, farre better thenbefore.

　　Their conference having long time continued, and the heate of theday being somewhat extraordinary, she called for Greeke wine, andbanquetting stuffe, drinking to Andrea; and he pledging her verycontentedly. After which, he would have returned to his lodging,because it drew neere supper time; which by no meanes shee wouldpermit, but seeming more then halfe displeased, shee saide. Now Iplainely perceive brother, how little account you make of me,considering, you are with your owne Sister, who (you say) you neversaw before, and in her owne House, whether you should alwayes resortwhen you come to this City; and would you now refuse her, to goe andsup at a common Inne? Beleeve me Brother, you shall sup with me, foralthough my Husband is now from home, to my no littlediscontentment: yet you shall find Brother, that his wife, can bid youwelcome, and make you good cheere beside.

　　Now was Andrea so confounded this extremity of courtesie, that heknew not what to say, but onely thus replied. I love you as a Sisterought to be loved, and accept of your exceeding kindnesse: but if Ireturne not to my lodging, I shall wrong mine Host and his gueststoo much, because they will not sup untill I come. For that (quothshee) we have a present remedy, one of my servants shall goe andgive warning, whereby they shall not tarry your comming. Albeit, youmight doe me a great kindnesse, to send for your friends to sup withus here, where I assure ye, they shall finde that your Sister (foryour sake) will bid them welcome, and after supper, you may allwalke together to your Inne. Andrea answered, that he had no suchfriends there, as should be so burthenous to her: but seeing she urgedhim so farre, he would stay to sup with her, and referred himselfesolely to her disposition.

　　Ceremonious shew was made, of sending a servant to the Inne, for notexpecting Andreas presence at Supper, though no such matter wasperformed; but, after divers other discoursings, the table beingcovered, and variety of costly viands placed thereon, downe theysate to feeding, with plenty of curious Wines liberally walking about,so that it was darke night before they arose from the table. Andreathen offring to take his leave, she would (by no meanes) suffer it,but tolde him, that Naples was a Citie of such strict Lawes andOrdinances, as admitted no night-walkers, although they wereNatives, much lesse strangers, but punnished them with great severity.And therefore, as she had formerly sent word to his Inne, that theyshould not expect his comming to supper, the like had she doneconcerning his bed, intending to give her Brother Andrea one nightslodging, which as easily she could affoord him, as shee had done aSupper. All which this new-caught Woodcocke verily crediting, and thathe was in company of his owne Sister Fiordeliza (for so did shecunningly stile her selfe, and in which beleefe he was meerelydeluded) he accepted the more gladly her gentle offer, and concludedto stay there all that night.

　　After supper, their conference lasted very long, purposely dilatedout in length, that a great part of the night might therein be wasted:when, leaving Andrea to his Chamber, and a Lad to attend, that heshould lacke nothing; she with her women went to their lodgings, andthus our Brother and supposed Sister were parted. The season thenbeing somewhat hot and soultry, Andrea put off his hose and doublet,and being in his shirt alone, layed them underneath the beds boulster,as seeming carefull of his money. But finding a provocation to thehouse of Office, he demanded of the Lad, where hee might find it;who shewed him a little doore in a corner of the Chamber, appointinghim to enter there. Safely enough he went in, but chanced to treadupon a board, which was fastened at neither, ende to the joyntswhereon it lay, being a pit-fall made of purpose, to entrap any suchcoxcombe, as would be trained to so base a place of lodging, so thatboth he and the board fell downe together into the draught; yet suchbeing his good fortune, to receive no harme in the fall (although itwas of extraordinary height) onely the filth of the place, (it beingover full) had fowly myred him.

　　Now for your better understanding the quality of the place, and whatensued thereupon, it is not unnecessary to describe it, according to acommon use, observed in those parts. There was a narrow passage orentrie, as often we see reserved betweene two houses, for eithersbenefit to such a needfull place; and boards loosely lay upon thejoynts, which such as were acquainted withall, could easily avoide anyperille in passing to or from the stoole. But our so newly createdBrother, not dreaming to find a Queane to his Sister, receiving sofoule a fall into the vault, and knowing not how to helpe himselfe,being sorrowfull beyond measure; cryed out to the boy for light andaide, who intended not to give him any. For the crafty wag, (a meeteattendant for so honest a Mistresse) no sooner heard him to be fallen,but presently he ran to enforme her thereof, and shee as speedilyreturned to the Chamber, where finding his cloathes under the bedshead, shee needed no instruction for search of his pockets. But havingfound the gold, which Andrea indiscreetely carried alwayes abouthim, as thinking it could no where else be so safe: This was allshee aymed at, and for which shee had ensnared him, faigning her selfeto be of Palermo, and Daughter to Piero of Perouse, so that notregarding him any longer, but making fast the house of Office doore,there she left him in that miserable taking.Poore Andrea perceiving, that his calles could get no answere fromthe Lad; cryed out louder, but all to no purpose: when seeing into hisowne simplicity, and understanding his error, though somewhat toolate, hee made such meanes constrainedly, that he got over a wall,which severed that foule sinke from the Worlds eye; and being in theopen streete, went to the doore of the House, which then he knew toowell to his cost, making loud exclaimes with rapping and knocking, butall as fruitelesse as before. Sorrowing exceedingly, and manifestlybeholding his misfortune; Alas (quoth he) how soone have I lost aSister, and five hundred Crownes besides? With many other words,loud calles, and beatings uppon the doore without intermission, theneighbours finding themselves disturbed, and unable to endure any suchceaselesse vexation, rose from their beddes, and called to him,desiring him to be gone, and let them rest. A Maide also of the samehouse, looking forth at the window, and seeming as newly raised fromsleepe, called to him, saying; What noyse is that beneath? WhyVirgin (answered Andrea) know you not me? I am Andrea de Piero,Brother to your Mistresse Fiordeliza. Thou art a drunken knave replyedthe Maide, more full of drinke then wit: goe sleepe, goe sleepe, andcome againe to morrow: for I know no Andrea de Piero, neither hathmy Mistresse any such Brother. Get thee gone go ie good man, andsuffer us to sleepe I prythee. How now (quoth Andrea) doest thou notunderstand what I say? Thou knowest that I supt with thy Mistressethis night; but if our Sicilian kindred be so soone forgot, Iprythee give mee my Cloathes which I left in my Chamber, and thenverie gladly will I get mee gone. Hereat the Maide laughing outaloude, saide; Surely the man is mad, or walketh the streetes in adreame: and so clasping fast the Window, away she went and left him.Now could Andrea assure himselfe, that his Golde and cloathes werepast recovery, which mooving him to the mor impatience, his formerintercessions became converted into furie, and what hee could notcompasse by faire intreats, he intended to winne by outrage andviolence: so that taking up a great stone in his hand, hee layedupon the doore verie powerfull strokes. The neighbors hearing thismollestation still, admitting them not the least respite of rest,reputed him for a troublesome fellow, and that he used thosecounterfet words, onely to disturbe the Mistresse of the house, andall that dwelled neere about her; looking againe out at theirwindowes, they altogether beganne to rate and reprove him, even likeso many bawling Curres, barking at a strange dog passing through thestreet. This is shamefull villany (quoth one) and not to besuffered, that honest women should thus be molested in their houses,with foolish idle words, and at such an unseasonable time of thenight. For Gods sake (good man) be gone, and let us sleepe; if thouhave any thing to say to the Gentlewoman of the house, come tomorrowin the daytime, and no doubt but she will make thee sufficient answer.

　　Andrea, being some what pacified with these speeches, ashagge-hayr'd swash-buckler, a grim visagde Ruffian (as sildomebawdy houses are without such swaggering Champions) not seene or heardby Andrea, all the while of his being in the house; rapping out two orthree terrible Oathes, opening a Casement, and with a stearnedreadfull voyce, demanded, who durst keepe that noyse beneath?Andrea fearefully looking up, and (by a little glimmering of theMoone) seeing such a rough fellow, with a blacke beard, strowting likethe quilles of a Porcupine, and patches on his face, for hurtsreceived in no honest quarrels, yawning also and stretching, asangry to have his sleepe disturbed: trembling and quaking, answered; Iam the Gentlewomans brother of the house. The Ruffian interruptinghim, and speaking more fiercely then before; sealing his words withhorrible Oathes, said. Sirra, Rascall, I know not of whence, or whatthou art; but if I come downe to thee, I will so bumbast thy pratingCoxecombe, as thou wast never so beaten in all thy life, like adrunken slave and beast as thou art, that all this night wilt notlet us sleepe. And so hee clapt to the window againe.

　　The Neighbours well acquainted with this Ruffians rude conditions,speaking in gentle manner to Andrea, said. Shift for thy selfe (goodman) in time, and tarrie not for his comming downe to thee, exceptthou art weary of thy life: Be gone therefore, and say thou hast afriendly warning. These words dismaying Andrea, but much more thesterne oathes and ougly sight of the Ruffian, incited also by theNeighbours counsell, whom he imagined to advise him in charitablemanner: it caused him to depart thence, taking the way home-ward tohis Inne, in no mean affliction and torment of minde, for themonstrous abuse offered him, and losse of his money. Well he remembredthe passages, whereby the day before the young Gyrle had guided him,but the loathsome smell about him, was so extreamely to himselfe, thatdesiring to wash him at the Sea side, he strayed too farre wide on thecontrary hand, wandring up the street called Ruga Gatellana.

　　Proceeding on still, even to the highest part of the Citie, heeespyed a Lanthorne and light, as also a man carrying it, and anotherman with him in company, both of them comming towards him. Now,because he suspected them two of the watch, or some persons that wouldapprehend him., he stept aside to shunne them, and entred into an oldehouse hard by at hand. The other mens intention was to the very sameplace; and going in, without any knowledge of Andreaes beeing there,one of them layde downe divers instruments of Iron which he hadbrought thither on his backe, and had much talke with his fellowconcerning those Engines. At last one of them saide; I smell themost abhominable stinke that ever I felt in all my life. So, liftingup the Lanthorn, he espied poore pittifull Andrea, closely couchedbehinde the wall. Which sight somewhat affrighting him, he yetboldly demaunded, what and who he was? Whereto Andrea answerednothing, but lay still and held his peace. Neerer they drew towardshim with their light, demanding how hee came thither, and in thatfilthy manner.

　　Constraint having now no other evasion, but that (of necessitie) allmust out: hee related to them the whole adventure, in the same sort asit had befalne him. They greatly pittying his misfortune, one ofthem said to the other: Questionlesse, this villanie was done in thehouse of Scarabone Buttafucco. And then turning to Andrea, proceededthus. In good faith poore man, albeit thou hast lost thy money, yetart thou much beholding to Fortune, for falling (though in a fouleplace) yet in a succesfull manner, and entring no more backe intothe house. For beleeve mee friend, if thou haddest not falne, butquietly gone to sleepe in the house, that sleepe had beene thy last inthis world, and with thy money, thou hadst lost thy life likewise. Butteares and lamentations are now helpelesse, because as easily mayestthou plucke the Starres from the Firmament, as get againe the leastdoyt of thy losse. And for that shag-haird Slave in the house, he willbe thy deathsman, if hee but understand that thou makest anyenquirie after thy money. When he had thus admonished him, he beganalso in this manner to comfort him. Honest fellow,- we cannot butpitty thy present condition: wherfore if thou wilt frendly associateus, in a businesse which we are instantly going to effect; thy lossehath not bene so great, but on our words we will warrant thee, thatthine immediate gaine shall farre exceede it. What will not a man(in desperate extremity) both well like and allow of, especiallywhen it carryeth apparance of present comfort. So fared it withAndrea, hee perswaded himselfe, worse then had already happened, couldnot befall him; and therefore he would gladly adventure with them.

　　The selfe same day preceding this disastrous night to Andrea, in thecheefe Church of the Cittie, had beene buried the Archbishop of Naplesnamed Signior Phillippo Minutulo, in his richest pontificall Robes andOrnaments, and a Ruby on his finger valued to be worth five hundredduckets of gold: this dead body they purposed to rob and rifle,acquainting Andrea with their whole intent, whose necessitie(coupled with a covetous desire) made him more forward then welladvised, to joyne with them in this sacriligious enterprize. On theywent towards the great Church, Andreaes unsavourie perfume muchdispleasing them, whereupon the one said to his fellow: Can wedevise no ease for this foule and noysome inconveniences? the verysmell of him will be a meanes to betray us. There is a Well-pit hardby, answered the other, with a pulley and bucket descending downe intoit, and there we may wash him from this filthinesse. To the Well-pitthey came, where they found the rope and pulley hanging readie, butthe bucket for safety was taken away; whereon they concluded, tofasten the rope about him, and so let him downe into the Well-pit, andwhen he had washed himselfe, hee should wagge the rope, and thenthey would draw him up againe, which accordingly they forthwithperformed.

　　Now it came to passe, that while he was thus washing himselfe in theWell-pit, the Watch of the Citie walking the round, and finding itto bee a very hote and sweltring night, they grew dry and thirsty, andtherefore went to the Well to drinke. The other two men, perceivingthe Watch so neere upon them, left Andrea in the pit to shift forhimselfe, running away to shelter themselves. Their flight was notdiscovered by the Watch, but they comming to the Wellpit, Andrearemained still in the bottome, and having cleansed himselfe so well ashee could, sate wagging the rope, expecting when hee should be haledup. This dumbe signe the Watch discerned not, but sitting downe by theWelles side, they layde downe their Billes and other weapons,tugging to draw up the rope, thinking the Bucket was fastened thereto,and full of water. Andrea being haled up to the Pits brim, leftholding the rope any longer, catching fast hold with his hands for hisbetter safety; and the Watch at the sight hereof being greatlyagrighted, as thinking that they had dragd up a Spirit; not daringto speake one word, ran away with all the hast they could make.

　　Andrea hereat was not a little amazed, so that if he had not takenvery good hold on the brim: he might have falne to the bottome, anddoubtlesse there his life had perished. Being come forth of theWell, and treading on Billes and Halbards, which he well knew that hiscompanions had not brought thither with them; his mervaile so much themore encreased, ignorance and feare still seizing him, with silentbemoaning his many misfortunes, away thence he wandred, but hee wistnot whither. As he went on, he met his two fellowes, who purposelyreturned to drag him out of the Well, and seeing their intentalready performed, desired to know who had done it: wherein Andreacould not resolve them, rehearsing what hee could, and what weaponshee found lying about the Well. Whereat they smiled, as knowing,that the Watch had haled him up, for feare of whom they left him,and so declared to him the reason of their returne.

　　Leaving off all further talke, because now it was about midnight,they went to the great Church, where finding their enterance to beeasie: they approached neere the Tombe, which was very great, beingtall of Marble, and the cover-stone weighty, yet with crowes of yronand other helps, they raised it so high, that a man might withoutperill passe into it. Now began they to question one another, which ofthe three should enter into the Tombe. Not I, said the first; sosaid the second: No nor I, answered Andrea. Which when the other twoheard, they caught fast hold of him, saying. Wilt not thou goe intothe Tombe? Be advised what thou sayest, for, if thou wilt not goein: we will so beat thee with one of these yron crowes, that thoushalt never goe out of this Church alive.

　　Thus poore Andrea is still made a property, and Fortune (this fatallnight) will have no other foole but he, as delighting in his hourlydisasters. Feare of their fury makes him obedient, into the grave hegoes, and being within, thus consults with himselfe. These cunningcompanions suppose me to be simple, and make me enter the Tombe,having an absolute intention to deceive me. For, when I have giventhem all the riches that I finde here, and am ready to come forthfor mine equall portion: away will they runne for their owne safety,and leaving me heere, not onely shall I loose my right among them, butmust remaine to what danger may follow after. Having thus meditated,he resolved to make sure of his owne share first, and remembring therich Ring, whereof they had tolde him: forthwith hee tooke it from theArchbishops finger, finding it indifferently fitte for his owne.Afterward, hee tooke the Crosse, Miter, rich garments, Gloves and all,leaving him nothing but his shirt, giving them all these severallparcels, protesting that there was nothing else. Still they pressedupon him, affirming that there was a Ring beside, urging him to searchdiligently for it; yet still he answered, that he could not findeit, and for their longer tarrying with him, seemed as if he serchedvery carefully, but all appeared to no purpose.

　　The other two fellowes, as cunning in craft as the third could be,still willed him to search, and watching their aptest opportunity:tooke away the proppes that supported the Tombe-stone, and runningthence with their got booty, left poore Andrea mewed up in thegrave. Which when he perceived, and saw this miserie to exceede allthe rest, it is farre easier for you to guesse at his greefe, then Iam any way, able to expresse it. His head, shoulders, yea all hisutmost strength he employeth, to remove that over-heavy hinderer ofhis libertie: but all his labour beeing spent in vaine, sorrow threwhim in a swoond upon the Byshoppes dead body, where if both of themmight at that instant have bin observed, the Arch-byshops deadbodie, and Andrea in greefe dying, very hardly had bene distinguished.But his senses regaining their former offices, among his silentcomplaints, consideration presented him with choyse of these twounavoydable extremities: Dye starving must he in the Tombe withputrifaction of the dead bodie; or if any man came to open theGrave, then must he be apprehended as a sacrilegious Theefe, and so behanged, according to the Lawes in that case provided.

　　As hee continued in these strange afflictions of minde, sodainelyhee heard a noise in the Church of divers men, who (as he imagined)came about the like businesse, as hee and his fellowes hadundertaken before; wherein he was not a jot deceived, albeit his fearethe more augmented. Having opened the Tombe, and supported thestone, they varied also among themselves for entrance, and anindiffrent while contended about it. At length, a Priest being onein the company, boldly said. Why how now you white-liver'd Rascals?What are you affraid of? Do you thinke he will eate you? Dead mencannot bite, and therefore I my selfe will go in. Having thusspoken, he prepared his entrance to the tomb in such order, that hethrust in his feete before, for his easier descending downe into it.

　　Andrea sitting upright in the Tombe, and desiring to make use ofthis happy opportunity, caught the Priest fast by one of his legges,making shew as if he meant to dragge him downe. Which when thePriest felt, he cryed out aloud, getting out with all the haste hecould make, and all his companions, being well-neere frighted out oftheir wits, ranne away amaine, as if they had bene followed by athousand divels. Andrea little dreaming on such fortunate successe,made meanes to get out of the grave, and afterward forth of theChurch, at the very same place where he entred.

　　Now began day-light to appeare, when he (having the rich Ring on hisfinger) wandred on hee knew not whether: till comming to the Sea side,he found the way directing to his Inne, where al his company were withhis Host, who had bene verie carefull for him.

　　Having related his manifold mischances, his Hoste friendly advisedhim with speede to get him out of Naples. As instantly he did,returning home to Perouse, having adventured his five hundredCrownes on a Ring, wherewith hee purposed to have bought Horses,according to the intent of his journey thither.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE SIXT NOVELL

　　HEEREIN ALL MEN ARE ADMONISHED, NEVER TO DISTRUST THE POWERFULL

　　HAND OF HEAVEN, WHEN FORTUNE SEEMETH TO BE MOST

　　ADVERSE AGAINST THEM

　　Madame Beritola Caracalla, was found in an Island with two Goates,having lost her two Sonnes, and thence travailed into Lunigiana: whereone of her Sonnes became servant to the Lord thereof, and was foundsomewhat overfamiliar with his Masters daughter, who thereforecaused him to be imprisoned. Afterward, when the country of Sicelyrebelled against King Charles, the aforesaid Sonne chanced to beeknowne by his Mother, and was married to his Masters daughter. And hisBrother being found likewise, they both returned to great estate andcredit.

　　The Ladies and Gentlemen also, having smiled sufficiently at theseverall accidents which did befall the poore Traveller Andrea,reported at large by Madam Fiammetta, the Lady Aimillia seeing hertale to be fully concluded, began (by commandement of the Queene) tospeak in this manner.

　　The diversitie of changes and alterations in Fortune as they aregreat, so must they needs be greevous; and as often as we takeoccasion to talke of them, so often do they awake and quicken ourunderstandings, avouching, that it is no easie matter to depend uponher flatteries. And I am of opinion, that to heare them recounted,ought not any way to offend us, be it of men wretched, or fortunate;because, as they instruct the one with good advice, so they animatethe other with comfort. And therefore, although great occasions havebeene already related, yet I purpose to tell a Tale, no lesse truethen lamentable; which albeit it sorted to a successefull ending,yet notwithstanding, such and so many were the bitter thwartings, ashardly can I beleeve, that ever any sorrow was more joyfully sweetned.

　　You must understand then (most gracious Ladies) that after the deathof Fredericke the second Emperour, one named Manfred, was crowned Kingof Sicily, about whom, lived in great account and authority, aNeapolitane Gentleman, called Henriet Capece, who had to Wife abeautifull Gentlewoman, and a Neapolitane also, named Madam BeritolaCaracalla. This Henriet held the government of the Kingdome of Sicily,and understanding that King Charles the first, had wonne the battle atBeneventum, and slaine King Manfred, the whole Kingdome revolting alsoto his devotion, and little trust to be reposed in the Sicillians,or he willing to subject himselfe to his Lordes enemie; provided forhis secret flight from thence. But this being discovered to theSicillians, he and many more, who had beene loyall servants to KingManfred, were suddenly taken and imprisoned by King Charles, and thesole possession of the Iland confirmed to him.

　　Madam Beritola not knowing (in so sudden and strange an alterationof State affaires) what was become of her Husband, fearing alsogreatly before, those inconveniences which afterward followed; beingovercome with many passionate considerations, having left and forsakenall her goods, going aboord a small Barke with a Sonne of hers, agedabout some eight yeeres, named Geoffrey, and growne great with childwith another, she fled thence to Lapary, where she was brought tobed of another Sonne, whom she named (answerable both to his and herhard fortune,) The poore expelled.

　　Having provided her selfe of a Nurse, they altogether went aboardagaine, setting sayle for Naples to visit her Parents; but itchanced quite contrary to her expectation, because by stormie windesand weather, the vessell being bound for Naples, was hurried to theIle of Ponzo, where entring into a small Port of the Sea, theyconcluded to make their aboade, till a time more furtherous shouldfavour their voyage.

　　As the rest, so did Madam Beritola goe on shore in the Iland,where having found a separate and solitary place, fit for her silentand sad meditations, secretly by her selfe, shee sorrowed for theabsence of her husband. Resorting daily to this her sad exercise,and continuing there her complaints, unseene by any of theMarriners, or whosoever else: there arrived suddenly a Galley ofPyrates, who seazing on the small Barke, carried it and all the restin it away with them. When Beritola had finished het wofullcomplaints, as daily shee was accustomed to doe, shee returned backeto her children againe; but find no person there remayning, whereatshe wondered not a little: immediately (suspecting what had happenedindeede) she lent her lookes on the Sea, and saw the Galley, whichas yet had not gone farre, drawing the smaller vessell after her.Hereby plainly she perceyved, that now she had lost her children, asformerly shee had done her husband; being left there poore,forsaken, and miserable, not knowing when, where, or how to findeany of them againe; and calling for her Husband and Children, sheefell downe in a swound uppon the shore.

　　Now was not any body neere, with coole water or any other remedyto helpe the recovery of her lost powers; wherefore her spiritsmight the more freely wander at their owne pleasure: but after theywere returned backe againe, and had won their wonted offices in herbody, drowned in teares, and wringing her hands, she did nothing butcall for her children and husband, straying all about in hope to findethem, seeking in caves, dens, and every where else, that presented theverie least glimpse of comfort. But when she saw all her paines sortto no purpose, and darke night drawing swiftly on, hope and dismayraising infinite perturbations, made her yet to be somewhat respectiveof her selfe, and therefore departing from the sea-shore, she returnedto the solitary place, where she used to sigh and mourne alone byher selfe.

　　The night being over-past with infinite feares and afrights, andbright day saluting the world againe, with the expence of ninehoures and more, she fell to her former fruitlesse travailes. Beingsomewhat sharply bitten with hunger, because the former day andnight shee had not tasted any foode: shee made therefore a benefitof necessity, and fed on the greene hearbes so well as she could,not without any piercing afflictions, what should become of her inthis extraordinary misery. As shee walked in these pensivemeditations, she saw a Goate enter into a Cave, and (within a whileafter) come forth againe, wandring along thorow the woods. Whereuponshe stayed, and entred where she saw the beast issue foorth, where shefound two young Kids, yeaned (as it seemed) the selfesame day, whichsight was very pleasing to her, and nothing in that distresse couldmore content her.

　　As yet, she had milke freshly running in both her brests, byreason of her so late delivery in child bed; wherefore shee laydowne unto the two yong Kids, and taking them tenderly in her armes,suffered each of them to sucke a teate, whereof they made not anyrefusall, but tooke them as lovingly as their dammes, and from thattime forward, they made no distinguishing betweene their damme andher. Thus this unfortunate Lady, having found some company in thissolitary desart, fed on herbes and roots, drinking faire runningwater, and weeping silently to her selfe, so often as she remembredher husband, children, and former dayes past in much better manner.Heere she resolved now to live and dye, being at last deprived both ofthe damme and yonger Kids also, by theyr wandering further into theneere adjoyning Woods, according to their naturall inclinations;whereby the poore distressed Ladie became more savage and wilde in herdaily conditions, then otherwise shee would have bene.

　　After many monthes were over-passed, at the very same place whereshe tooke landing; by chance, there arrived another small vessell ofcertaine Pisans, which remained there divers daies. In this Barkewas a Gentleman, named Conrado de Marchesi Malespini, with his holyand vertuous wife, who were returned backe from a Pilgrimage, havingvisited all the sanctified places that then were in the kingdome ofApulia, and now were bound homeward to their owne abiding. ThisGentleman, for the expelling of melancholly perturbations, oneespeciall day amongst other, with his wife, servants, and waintinghounds, wandred up into the Iland not far from the place of MadamBeritolaes desert dwelling. The hounds questing after game, at lasthappened on the two Kids where they were feeding, and (by this time)had attained to indifferent growth; and finding themselves thuspursued by the hounds, fled to no other part of the wood, then tothe cave where Beritola remained, and seeming as if they sought tobe rescued only by her, she sodainly caught up a staffe, and forcedthe hounds thence to flight.

　　By this time, Conrado and his wife, who had followed closely afterthe hounds, was come thither, and seeing what had hapned, looking onthe Lady, who was become blacke, swarthy, meager, and hairy, theywondered not a little at her, and she a great deale more at them. When(uppon her request) Conrado had checkt backe his hounds, theyprevailed so much by earnest intreaties, to know what she was, and thereason of her living there; that she intirely related her quality,unfortunate accidents, and strange determination for living there.Which when the Gentleman had heard, who very well knew her husband,compassion forced teares from his eyes, and earnestly he laboured bykinde perswasions, to alter so cruell a deliberation; making anhonourable offer, for conducting her home to his owne dwelling,where shee should remaine with him in noble respect, as if she werehis owne sister, without parting from him, till Fortune should smileas fairely on her, as ever she had done before.

　　When these gentle offers could not prevaile with her, theGentleman left his wife in her company, saying, that he would go fetchsome foode for her; and because her garments were all rent andtorne, hee would bring her other of his wives, not doubting but towinne her thence with them. His wife abode there with Beritola,verie much bemoaning her great disasters: and when both viands andgarments were brought, by extremitie of intercession, they causedher to put them on, and also to feede with them, albeit sheeprotested, that shee would not part thence into any place, where anyknowledge should be taken of her. In the end, they perswaded her to gow-th them into Lunigiana, carrying also with her the two yong Goatsand their damme, which were then in the cave altogether, prettilyplaying before Beritola, to the great admiration of Conrado and hiswife, as also the servants attending on them.

　　When the windes and weather grew favourable for them, MadameBeritola went aboord with Conrado and his Wife, being followed bythe two young Goates and their Damme; and because her name shouldbee knowne to none but Conrado, and his wife onely, shee would bestiled no otherwise but the Goatherdesse. Merrily, yet gently blew thegale, which brought them to enter the River of Maira, where going onshore, and into their owne Castle, Beritola kept company with the wifeof Conrado, but in a mourning habite; and a waiting Gentlewoman oftheirs, honest, humble, and very dutifull, the Goates alwayesfamiliarly keeping them company.

　　Returne wee now to the Pyrates, which at Ponzo seized on the smallBarke wherein Madame Beritola was brought thither, and carriedthence away, without any sight or knowledge of her. With such otherspoyles as they had taken, they shaped their course for Geneway, andthere (by consent of the Patrones of the Galley) made a division oftheir booties. It came to passe, that (among other things) the Nursethat attended on Beritola, and the two Children with her, fell tothe share of one Messer Gastarino d'Oria, who sent them together tohis owne House, there to be employed in service as Servants. The Nurseweeping beyond measure for the losse of her Ladie, and bemoaning herowne miserable Fortune, whereinto shee was now fallen with the twoyoung Laddes; after long lamenting, which shee found utterlyfruitlesse and to none effect, though she was used as a servant withthem, and being but a very poore woman, yet was shee wise anddiscreetly advised. Wherefore, comforting both her selfe and them sowell as she could, and considering the depth of their disaster, sheeconceited thus, that if the Children should be knowne, it mightredound to their greater danger, and shee be no way advantagedthereby.

　　Hereupon, hoping that Fortune (earely or late) would alter herstearne malice, and that they might (if they lived) regaine oncemore their former condition, shee would not disclose them to any onewhatsoever, till shee should see the time aptly disposed for THESECOND DAY, THE SIXT 75

　　it. Being thus determined, to all such as questioned herconcerning them, she answered that they were her owne Children, namingthe eldest not Geoffrey, but Jehannot de Procida. As for theyongest, shee cared not greatly for changing his name, and thereforewisely informed Geoffrey, upon what reason shee had altered hisname, and what danger he might fall into, if he should otherwise bediscovered; being not satisfied with thus telling him once, butremembring him thereof verie often, which the gentle youth (being sowell instructed by the wise and carefull Nurse) did very warilyobserve.

　　The two young Laddes, verie poorely garmented, but much worsehosed and shodde, continued thus in the house of Gasparino, where boththey and the Nurse were long time employed about verie base anddrudging Offices, which yet they endured with admirable patience.But Jehannot, aged already about sixteene yeeres, having a loftierspirit, then belonged to a slavish servant, despising the basenesse ofhis servile condition; departed from the drudgery of Messer Gasparino,and going aboord the Gallies which were bound for Alexandria, fortunedinto many places, yet none of them affoording him any advancement.In the end, about three or foure yeeres after his departure fromGasparino, being now a brave yong man, and of very goodly forme: heunderstood, that his father (whom he supposed to be dead) was as yetliving, but in captivity, and prisoner to King Charles. Wherefore,despairing of any successefull fortune, he wandred here and there,till he came to Lunigiana, and there (by strange accident) he becameservant to Messer Conrado Malespino, where the service proved wellliking to them both.

　　Very sildome times hee had a sight of his Mother, because sheealwayes kept company with Conradoes wife; and yet when they camewithin view of each other, shee knew not him, nor he her, so muchyeres had altred them both from what they were wont to be, and whenthey saw each other last. Jehannot being thus in the service of MesserConrado, it fortuned that a daughter of his, named Sophia, being thewiddow of one Messer Nicolas Grignam, returned home to her Fathershouse. Very beautifull and amiable she was, young likewise, aged butlittle above sixteene; growing wonderously amorous of Jehannot, and heof her, in extraordinary and most fervent manner: which love was notlong without full effect, continuing many moneths before any personcould perceyve it: which making them to build on the more assurance,they began to carry their meanes with lesse discretion then isrequired in such nice cases, and which cannot be too providentlymanaged.

　　Upon a day, he and she walking to a goodly Wood, plentifullyfurnished with spreading Trees: having out gone the rest of theircompany, they made choise of a pleasant place, very daintily shadedand beautified with all sorts of flowers. There they spent some timein amorous talking, beside some other sweete embraces, which though itseemed over-short to them, yet was it so unadvisedly prolonged, thatthey were on a sodain surprized, first by the mother, and next byMesser Conrado himselfe; who greeving beyond measure, to be thustreacherously dealt withall, caused them to be apprehended by three ofhis servants; and (without telling them any reason why) led bound toanother Castle of his, and fretting with extremity rage, concludedin his minde, that they should both shamefully be put to death.

　　The Mother unto this regardlesse daughter, having heard the angriewordes of her Husband, and how hee would be revenged on the faulty;could not endure that he should be so severe: wherefore, although sheewas likewise much afflicted in minde, and reputed her Daughterworthy (for so great an offence) of all cruell punnishment, yet shehasted to her displeased husband, and began to entreate, that heewould not runne on in such a furious spleene, now in his aged yeeresto be the murtherer of his owne childe, and soile his hands in theblood of his servant. Rather he might finde out some milde coursefor the satisfaction of his anger, by committing them to closeimprisonment, there to remaine and mourne for their folly committed.The vertuous and religious Lady alledged so many commendable examples,and used such plenty of moving perswasions, that she quite altredhis minde from putting them to death, and hee commanded onely, thatthey should separately be imprisoned, with little store of food, andlodging of the uneasiest, untill he should otherwise determine ofthem; and so it was done. What their life now was in captivity andcontinuall teares, with stricter abstinence then was needefull forthem, all this I must commit to your consideration. Jehannot and Spinaremaining in this comfortlesse condition, and an whole yeere being nowout-worne, yet Conrado keeping them thus still imprisoned: it cameto passe, that Don Pedro King of Arragon, by the meanes of Messer Johnde Procida, caused the Isle of Sicily to revolt, and tooke it awayfrom King Charles; whereat Conrado (he being of the Ghibbilinefaction) not a little rejoyced. Jehannot having intelligencethereof, by some of them that had him in custody, breathing foorth avehement sighe, spake in this manner. Alas poore miserable wretch as Iam! that have already gone begging thorough the world above foureteeneyeeres, in expectation of nothing else but this opportunity; and nowit is come, must I be in prison, to the end, that I should nevermore hope for any future happinesse? And how can I get forth of thisprison, except it bee by death onely? How now, replyed the Officerof the Guard? What doth this businesse of great Kings concerne thee?What affayres hast thou in Sicily?

　　Once more Jehannot sighed extreamly, and returned him this answer.Me thinkes my heart (quoth hee) doeth cleave in sunder, when I call tominde the charge which my Father had there; for although I was but alittle boy when I fled thence, yet I can well remember, that I saw himGovernor there, at such time as King Manfred lived. The Guard,pursuing on still his purpose, demanded of him, what and who hisFather was? My Father (replied Jehannot?) I may now securely speake ofhim, being out of the perill which neerely concerned me if I had beenediscovered: he was the named (and so still if he be living) henrietCapece, and my name is Geoffrey, and not Jehannot; and I make nodoubt, but if I were freed from hence, and might returned home toSicily, I should (for his sake) be placed in some authority.

　　The honest man of the Guard, without seeking after any furtherinformation; so soone as he could compasse any leysure, reported allto Messer Conrado, who having heard these newes (albeit he made noshew thereof to the revealer) went to Madam Beritola, graciouslydemaunding of her, if she had any sonne by her husband, who was calledGeoffrey. The Lady replyed in teares, that if her eldest sonne were asyet living, he was so named, and now aged about two and twenty yeeres.Conrado hearing this, imagined this same to be the man; consideringfurther withall, that if it fell out to prove so, hee might have thebetter meanes of mercie, and closely concealing his daughters shame,joyfully joyne them in marriage together.

　　Hereupon, he secretly called Jehannot before him, examining himparticularly of all his passed life, and finding (by most manifestarguments) that his name was truly Geoffrey, and the eldest son ofHenriet Capece, he spake thus to him. Jehannot, thou knowest how greatthe injuries are that thou hast done me, and my deere daughter; gentlyintreating thee (as became an honest servant) that thou shouldestalwayes have bene respective of mine honor, and all that appertaineunto me. There are many noble Gentlemen, who sustaining the wrongwhich thou hast offred me, they would have procured thy shamefulldeath, which pitty and compassion will not suffer in me. Whereforeseeing (as thou informest me) that thou art honourably derived both byfather and mother, I will give end to all thy anguishes, even when thyselfe art so pleased, releasing thee from that captivity wherein Ihave so long kept thee, and in one instant, reduce thine honor andmine into compleat perfection. As thou knowest my daughter Spina, whomthou hast embraced as a friend (although far unfitting for thee, orher) is a widdow, and her marriage is both great and good; what hermanners and conditions are, thou indifferently knowest, and art notignorant of her father and mother: concerning thine owne estate, asnow I purpose not to speake any thing. Therefore, when thou wilt, I amdetermined, that whereas thou hast immodestly affected her, sheshall become thy honest wife, and accepting thee as my sonne, toremaine with me so long as you both please.

　　Imprisonment had somwhat mishapen Jehannot in his outward forme, butnot impaired a jot of his noble spirit; much lesse the true love whichhe bare his friend. And although most earnestly he desired thatwhich now Conrado had so frankly offered him, and was in his poweronely to bestow on him; yet could he not cloud any part of hisgreatnes, but with a resolved judgement, thus replied. My Lord,affectation of rule, desire of welthy possessions, or any other matterwhatsoever could never make me a traitor to you or yours; but that Ihave loved, do love, and for ever shal love your beauteous daughter:if that be treason, I do free confesse it, and will die a thousanddeaths before you or any else shall enforce me to deny it, for Ihold her highly worthy of my love. If I have bin more unmannerlywith her then became me, I have committed but that error, whichevermore is so attendant uppon youth; that to deny, is to denieyouth also. And if reverend age would but remember, that once he wasyoung and measure others offences by his owne, they would not bethoght so great, as you (and many more) account them to be, mine beingcommitted as a friend, and not as an enemy. What you make offer ofso willingly, I have alwayes desired; and if I had thought it wouldhave beene granted, long since I had most humbly requested it: andso much the more acceptable would it have bin to me, by how much thefurther off it stood from my hopes. But if you bee so forward asyour words doe witnesse, then feed me not with any furtherfruitlesse expectation; but rather send me backe to prison, and lay asmany afflictions on me as you please. For my endeered love to yourdaughter Spina, maketh mee to love you the more for her sake, howhardly soever you intreat me; and bindeth me in the greaterreverence to you, as being the Father of my fairest friend.

　　Messer Conrado hearing these words, stood as one confounded withadmiration, reputing him to be a man of loftie spirit, and hisaffection most fervent to his Daughter, which was not a little tohis liking. Wherefore, embracing him, and kissing his cheeke,without any longer dallying, hee sent in like manner for his Daughter.Her restraint in prison, had made her lookes meager, pale, andwanne, and very weake was she also of her person, faire differing fromthe Woman she was wont to be, before be, before her affection toJehannot. There in presence of her Father, and with free consent ofeither, they were contracted as man and wife, and the espousals agreedon according to custome. Some few dayes after, (without any onesknowledge of that which was done) having furnished them with allthings fit for the purpose, and time aptly serving, that the Mothersshould be partakers in this joy; he called his wife, and MadamBeritola, to whom first he spake in this manner.

　　What will you say Madame, if I cause you to see your eldest Son, notlong since married to one of my daughters? Whereunto Beritola thusreplied. My Lord, I can say nothing else unto you, but that I shalbe much more obliged to you, then already I am; and the rather,because you will let me see the thing which is deerer then mine ownelife; and rendering it unto me in such manner as you speake of, youwill recall backe some part of my former lost hopes: and with thesewords, the teares streamed aboundantly from her eyes. Then turningto his wife, he said: And you deere Love, if I shew you such a Sonin law, what will you thinke of it? Sir (quoth she) what pleaseth you,must and shall satisfie me, be he gentleman or beggar. Well saidMadam, answered Messer Conrado, I hope shortly, to make you bothjoyfull. So when the amorous couple had recovered their formerfeature, and honorable garments prepared for them, privately thus hesaid to Geoffrey; Beyond the joy which already thou art inrichedwithall, how would it please thee to meete thine owne Mother here? Icannot beleeve Sir (replied Geoffrey) that her greevous misfortuneshave suffered her to live so long; and yet, if heaven hath bin somercifull to her, my joyes were incomparable, for by her graciouscounsel, I might well hope to recover no meane happines in Sicily.Soone after, both the mothers were sent for, who were transported withunspeakable joy, when they beheld the so lately married couple:being much amazed what inspiration had guided Messer Conrado to thisextraordinary benignity, in joyning Jehannot in marriage with Spina.Hereupon, Madam Beritola remembring the speeches betweene her andMesser Conrado, began to observe him very advisedly; and by a hiddenvertue which long had silently slept in her, and now with joy ofspirit awaked, calling to mind the lineatures of her sonnes infancy,without awaiting for any other demonstration, she folded him in herarmes with earnest affection. Motherly joy and pity now contended soviolently togither, that she was not able to utter one word, thesensitive vertues being so closely combined, that (even as dead) shefell downe in the armes of her Son. And he wondering greatlythereat, making a better recollection of his thoughts, did wellremember, that hee had often before seene her in the Castle, withoutany other knowledge of her. Neverthelesse, by meere instinct ofNature, whose power in such actions declares it selfe to be highlypredominant; his very soule assured him, that she was his Mother,and blaming his understanding, that he had not before bene betteradvised, he threw his armes about her, and wept exceedingly.

　　Afterward, by the loving paines of Conradoes wife, as also herdaughter Spina, Madam Beritola (being recovered from her passionatetraunce, and her vitall spirits executing their Offices againe) fellonce more to the embracing of her Sonne, kissing him infinite times,with teares and speeches of motherly kindnesse, he likewise expressingthe same dutifull humanity to her. Which ceremonious courtesiesbeing passed over and over, to no little joy in all the beholders,beside repetition of their severall misfortunes, Messer Conrado madeall knowne to his friends, who were very glad of this new alliancemade by him, which was honoured with many solemne feastings. Whichbeing all concluded, Geoffrey having found out fit place andopportunity, for conference with his new created Father, without anysinister opposition, began as followeth.

　　Honourable Father, you have raised my contentment to the highestdegree, and have heaped also many gracious favours on my Noble Mother;but now in the finall conclusion, that nothing may remaine uneffected,which consisteth in your power to performe: I would humbly entreateyou, to honour my Mother with your company, at a Feast of my making,where I would gladly also have my Brother present. Messer Gasparinod'Oria (as I have heretofore told you) questing as a common Pyrat onthe Seas, tooke us and sent us home to his house as slaves, where(as yet) he detaineth him. I would likewise have you send into Sicily,who informing himselfe more amply in the state of the Countrey, mayunderstand what is become of Henriet my Father, and whether he beliving or no. If he be alive, then to know in what condition he is;and being secretly instructed in all things, then to returne backeagaine to you.

　　This motion made by Geoffrey, was so pleasing to Conrado, thatwithout any reference to further leysure, hee dispatched thence twodiscreete persons, the one to Geneway, and the other to Sicily: hewhich went for Geneway, having met with Gasparino, earnestly entreatedhim (on the behalfe of Conrado) to send him the Poore expelled; andhis Nurse recounting every thing in order, which Conrado had toldehim, concerning Geoffrey and his mother. When Gasparino had heardthe whole discourse, he marvelled greatly thereat, and saide; Trueit is, that I will doe any thing for Messer Conrado, which may beeto his love and liking, provided, that it lye in my power to performe;and (about some foureteene yeeres since) I brought such a Lad as youseeke for, with his mother, home to my house, whom I will gladlysend unto him. But you may tell him from me, that I advise him fromover-rash crediting the Fables of Jehannot, that now termes himselfeby the name of Geoffrey, because he is a more wicked boy then hetaketh him to be, and so did I finde him.

　　Having thus spoken, and giving kinde welcome to the Messenger,secretly he called the Nurse unto him, whom hee heedfully examinedconcerning this case. She having heard the rebellion in the Kingdomeof Sicily; and understanding withall that Henriet was yet living,joyfully threw off all her former feare, relating every thing to himorderly, and the reasons moving her to conceale the whole businesse insuch manner as shee had done. Gasparino well perceiving, that thereport of the Nurse, and the message received from Conrado, varied notin any one circumstance, began the better to credit her words. Andbeing a man most ingenious, making further inquisition into thebusinesse, by all the possible meanes hee could devise; and findingevery thing to yeeld undoubted assurance, ashamed of the vile and baseusage wherein he had so long time kept the Lad, and desiring (by hisbest meanes) to make him amends, he had a beautifull daughter, agedabout thirteene yeares, and knowing what manner of man he was, hisFather Henriet also yet living, he gave her to him in marriage, with avery bountifull and honourable dowry.

　　The joviall dayes of feasting being past, he went aboord a Galleywith the Poore expelled, his Daughter, the Ambassador, and theNurse, departing thence to Lericy, where they were nobly welcommedby Messer Conrado, and his Castle being not farre from thence, with anhonourable traine they were conducted thither, and entertained withall possible kindnesse. Now concerning the comfort of the Mother,meeting so happily with both her sonnes, the joy of the brethren andmother together, having also found the faithful Nurse, Gasparino andhis daughter, in company now with Conrado and his wife, friends,familiars, and all generally in a jubilee of rejoycing: it exceedethcapacity in mee to expresse it, and therefore I referre it to yourmore able imagination.

　　In the time of this mutuall contentment, to the end that nothingmight be wanting to compleat and perfect this universall joy; ourLord, a most abundant bestower where he beginneth, added long wishedtydings concerning the life and good estate of Henry Capece. For, evenas they were feasting, and the concourse great of worthy guests,both Lords and Ladies; the first service was scarsely set on theTables, but the Ambassador which was sent to Sicily, arrived therebefore them. Among many other important matters, he spake ofHenriet, who being so long a time detained in prison by KingCharles, when the commotion arose in the Citty against the King; thepeople (grudging at Henriets long imprisonment) slew the Guards, andset him at liberty. Then as capitall enemie to King Charles, hee wascreated Captaine Generall, following the chase, and killing theFrench.

　　Now by this meanes, he grew great in the grace of King Pedro, whoreplanted him in all the goods and honours which he had before, withverie high and eminent authority. Hereunto the Ambassador added,that hee was entertayned with extraordinary grace, and delivery ofpublike joy and exaltation, when his Wife and Sonne were knowne tobe living, of whom no tydings had at any time bene heard, since thehoure of his surprizall. Moreover, that a swift winged Bark was nowsent thither (upon the happy hearing of this newes) well furnishedwith noble Gentlemen, to attend till their returning backe. We needeto make no doubt concerning the tydings brought by this Ambassadour,nor of the Gentlemens welcome, thus sent to Madame Beritola andGeoffrey; who before they would sit downe at the Table, saluted MesserConrado and his kinde Lady (on the behalfe of Henriet) for all thegreat graces extended to her and her Sonne, with promise of any thing,lying in the power of Henriet, to rest continually at their command.The like they did to Signior Gasparino (whose liberall favours cameunlooked for) with certaine assurance, that when Henriet shouldunderstand what he had done for his other Sonne, the Poore expelled,there would be no defaylance of reciprocall courtesies.

　　As the longest joyes have no perpetuity of lasting, so all thesegraceful ceremonies had their conclusion, with as many sighes andteares at parting, as joyes abounded at their first encountring.Imagine then, that you see such aboord, as were to have here no longerabiding, Madam Beritola and Geoffrey, with the rest; as the Pooreexpelled, the so late married Wives, and the faithfull Nurse bearingthem company. With prosperous windes they arrived in Sicily, where theWife, Sonnes, and Daughters, were joyfully met by Henriet atPalermo, and with such honourable pompe, as a case so importantequally deserved. The Histories make further mention, that therethey lived (a long while after) in much felicitie, with thankfullhearts (no doubt) in Heaven, in acknowledgement of so many greatmercies received.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　A LIVELY DEMONSTRATION, THAT THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN (OFTENTIMES)

　　IS VERY HURTFULL TO HER SELFE, AND THE OCCASION

　　OF MANY EVILS, YEA, AND OF DEATH, TO DIVERS MEN

　　The Soldan of Babylon sent one of his Daughters, to be joyned inmarriage with the King of Cholcos, who by divers accidents (in thespace of foure yeeres) happened into the custodie of nine men, andin sundry places. At length, being restored backe to her Father, shewent to the saide King of Cholcos, as a Maid, and as at first shewas intended to be his wife.

　　Peradventure the Novell related by Madam Aemillia, did not extend itselfe so farre in length, as it mooved compassion in the Ladiesmindes, the hard fortunes of Beritol and her Children, which hadincited them to weeping: but that it pleased the Queen (upon the Talesconclusion) to command Pamphilus, to follow next in order with hisDiscourse; and he being thereto very obedient, began in this manner.

　　It is a matter of no meane difficulty (vertuous Ladies) for us totake intire knowledge of every thing we doe, because (as oftentimeshath bene observed) many men, imagining if they were rich, they shouldlive securely, and without any cares. And therefore, not onely havetheyr prayers and intercessions aimed at that end, but also theirstudies and daily endevours, without refusall of any paines orperils have not meanely expressed their hourely solicitude. Andalthough it hath happened accordingly to them, and their covetousdesires fully accomplished; yet at length they have mette with suchkinde people, who likewise thirsting after their wealthypossessions, have bereft them of life, being their kinde andintimate friends, before they attained to such riches. Some other,being of lowe and base condition, by adventuring in many skirmishesand foughten battels, trampling in the bloud of their brethren andfriends, have bene mounted to the soveraigne dignity of Kingdomes(beleeving that therein consisted the truest happinesse) but boughtwith the deerest price of their lives. For, beside their infinit caresand feares wherewith such greatnesse is continually attended, at theroyall Tables, they have drunke poyson in a Golden pot. Many otherin like manner (with most earnest appetite) have coveted beauty andbodily strength, not foreseeing with any judgement, that thesewishes were not without perill; when being endued with them, theyeither have bene the occasion of their death, or such a lingeringlamentable estate of life, as death were a thousand times more welcometo them.

　　But, because I would not speake particularly of all our fraile andhumane affections, I dare assure ye, that there is not any one ofthese desires to be elected among us mortals, with entire forsightor providence, warrantable against their ominous yssue. Wherefore,if we would walke directly, wee should dispose our willes andaffections, to be guided onely by him, who best knoweth what isneedfull for us, and will bestow them at his good pleasure. Nor let melay this blamefull imputation uppon men onely, for offending in manythrough over lavish desires: because you your selves (gracious Ladies)sinne highly in one, as namely, in coveting to be beautifull. Sothat it is not sufficient for you, to enjoy those beauties bestowne onyou by Nature; but you practice to increase them by the rarities ofArt. Wherefore, let it not offend you, that I tell you the hardfortune of a faire Sarazine, to whom it hapned by straunge adventures,that within the compasse of foure yeares, nine severall times to bemarried. and onely for her beauty.

　　It is now a long time since, that there lived Soldane in Babylon,named Beminidab, to whom (while he lived) many things happened,answerable to his owne desires. Among divers other Children bothmale and female, hee had a daughter called Alathiella, and shee(according to the common voyce of every one that saw her) was thefayrest Lady then living in all the world. And because the King ofCholcos had wonderfully assisted him, in a most valiant foughtenbattell against a mighty Armie of Arabians, who on a sodaine hadassailed him; he demanded his faire daughter in marriage, whichlikewise was kindly granted to him. Whereupon a goodly andwell-armed Ship was prepared for her, with full furnishment of allnecessary provision, and accompanied with an honourable traine both ofLords and Ladies, as also most costly and sumptuous accoustrements;commending her to the mercy of heaven, in this maner was she sentaway.

　　The time being propitious for their parting thence, the Marinershoised their sayles, leaving the port of Alexandria, and saylingprosperously many dayes together. When they had past the Countrey ofSardinia, and (as they imagined) were well neere to their journeyesend; sodainely arose boysterous and contrary windes, which were soimpetuous beyond all measure, and so tormented the Ship wherein theLady was; that the Mariners seeing no signe of comfort, gave overall hope of escaping with life. Neverthelesse, as men most expert inimplacable dangers, they laboured to their uttermost power, andcontended with infinite blustring tempests, for the space of two dayesand nights together, hoping the third day would prove more favourable.But therein they saw themselves deceyved, for the violence continuedstill, encreasing in the night time more and more, being not any wayable to comprehend either where they were, or what course theytooke, neither by Marinall judgement, or any apprehension elsewhatsoever, the heavens were so clouded, and the nights darkenesseso extreame.Beeing (unknowne to them) neere the Isle of Majorica, they felt theShippe to split in the bottome: by meanes whereof, perceiving now nohope of escaping (every one caring for himselfe, and not any other)they threw foorth a Squiffe on the troubled waves, reposing moreconfidence of safety that way, then abiding any longer in the brokenship. Howbeit such as were first descended downe, made stoutresistance against all other followers, with their drawne weapons: butsafety of life so far prevayled, that what with the Tempests violence,and over lading of the Squiffe, it sunke to the bottome, and allperished that were therein. The Ship being thus split, and more thenhalfe full of water, tossed and tormented by the blustring windes,first one way, and then another: was at last driven into a strond ofthe Isle Majorica, no other persons therein remaining, but onely theLady and her women, all of them (through the rude tempest, and theirowne conceived feare) lying still, as if they were more then halfedead. And there, within a stones cast of the neighboring shore theship (by the rough surging billowes) was fixed fast in the sands,and so continued all the rest of the night, without any furthermolestation of the windes.

　　When day appeared, and the violent stormes were more mildly appeasedthe Ladie, who seemed well-neere dead, lifted up her head, and began(weake as she was) to call first one, and then another: but sheecalled in vaine, for such as she named were farre enough from her.Wherefore, hearing no answere, nor seeing any one, she wondredgreatly, her feares encreasing then more and more. Raising her selfeso well as shee could, she beheld the Ladies that were of her company,and some other of her women, lying still without any stirring:whereupon, first jogging one, and then another, and calling themseverally by their names; shee found them bereft of understanding, andeven as if they were dead, their hearts were so quayled, and theirfeare so over-ruling, which was no meane dismay to the poore Ladyher selfe. Neverthelesse, necessity now being her best counsellor,seeing her selfe thus all alone, and not knowing in what place sheewas, shee used such meanes to them that were living, that (at thelast) they came to better knowledge of themselves. And being unable toguesse, what was become of the men and Marriners, seeing the Ship alsodriven on the sands, and filled with water, she began with them tolament most greevously: and now it was about the houre of mid day,before they could descry any person on the shore, or any els to pitythem in so urgent a necessity.

　　At length, noone being past, a Gentleman named Bajazeth, attended bydivers of his followers on horsebacke, and returning from a Countriehouse belonging to him, chanced to ride by on the sands. Uppon sightof the Ship lying in that case, he imagined truely what had hapned,and commanded one of his men to enter aboord it, which (with somedifficultie) hee did, to resolve his Lord what remained therein. Therehee found the faire yong Lady, with such small store of company as wasleft her, fearefully hidden under the prow of the Ship. So soone asthey saw him, they held up their hands, wofully desiring mercy of him:but he perceiving their lamentable condition, and that hee understoodenot what they saide to him, their affliction grew the greater,labouring by signes and gestures, to give him knowledge of theirmisfortune.

　　The servant gathering what he could by their outward behaviour,declared to his Lord what hee had seene in the Ship; who caused theWomen to be brought on shore, and all the precious things remainingwith them; conducting them with him to a place not far off, where withfood and warmth he gave them comfort. By the rich garments which theLady was cloathed withall, he reputed her to be a Gentlewoman wellderived, as the great reverence done to her by the rest, gave him goodreason to conceive. And although her lookes were pale and wan, as alsoher person mightily altered, by the tempestuous violence of the Sea:yet notwithstanding, she appeared faire and lovely in the eye ofBajazeth, whereupon forthwith he determined, that if she were notmarried, hee would enjoy her as his owne in marriage: or if he couldnot winne her to bee his wife, yet (at the least) shee should be hisfriend, because she remained now in his power.

　　Bajazeth was a man of stearne lookes, rough and harsh both in speechand behaviour; yet causing the Lady to be honourably used divers dayestogether, shee became thereby well comforted and recovered. And seeingher beautie to exceede all comparison, he was afflicted beyondmeasure, that he could not understand her, nor she him, whereby heecould not know of whence or what she was. His amorous flamesencreasing more and more; by kinde, courteous, and affable actions, helaboured to compasse what he aymed at. But all his endeavour proved tono purpose, for she refused all familiar privacie with him, which somuch the more kindled the fury of his fire. This being well observedby the Lady, having now remained there a moneth and more, andcollecting by the customes of the Countrey, that she was among Turkes;and in such a place, where although she were knowne, yet it wouldlittle advantage her; beside, that long protraction of time wouldprovoke Bajazeth by faire meanes or force to obtaine his will: shepropounded to her selfe (with magnanimity of spirit) to tread allmisfortunes under her feete, commanding her Women (whereof shee hadbut three now remaining alive) that they should not disclose whatshe was, except it were in some such place, where manifest signesmight yeeld hope of regaining their liberty. Moreover, sheadmonished them stoutly to defend their honour and chastity;affirming, that she had absolutely resolved with her selfe, that neverany other shou enjoy her, but her intended husband: wherein herwomen did much commend her, promising to preserve their reputation,according as shee had commanded.

　　Day by day, were the torments of Bajazeth wonderfully augmented, yetstill his kinde offers scornefully refused, and he as farre off fromcompassing his desires, as when he first beganne to moove thematter: wherefore, perceiving that all faire courses served to noeffect, hee resolved to compasse his purpose by craft and subtilty,reserving rigorous extremitie for his finall conclusion. And havingonce observed, that wine was verie pleasing to the Lady, she beingnever used to drinke any at all, because (by her Countries Law) it wasforbidden her: and no meane store having beene lately brought toBajazeth in a Barke of Geneway: hee resolved to surprize her by meanesthereof, as a cheefe minister of Venus, to heate the coolest blood.And seeming now in his outward behaviour, as if hee had given over hisamorous pursuite, and which she strove by all her best endeavours towithstand: one night, after a very majesticke and solemne manner,hee prepared a delicate and sumptuous supper, whereto the Lady wasinvited: and hee had given order, that hee who attended on her Cup,should serve her with many Wines compounded and mingled together;which hee accordingly performed, as being cunning enough in suchoccasions.

　　Alathiella mistrusting no such trechery intended against her, andliking the Wines pleasing taste extraordinarily, dranke more thenstoode with her precedent modest resolution, and forgetting all herpassed adversities, became very frolicke and merry: so that seeingsome women dance after the manner observed there in Majorica, she alsofell to dauncing according to the Alexandrian custome. Which whenBajazeth beheld, he imagined the victory to be more then halfewonne, and his hearts desire verie neere the obtaining: plying herstill with wine upon wine, and continuing this revelling the most partof the night.

　　At the length, the invited guests being all gone, the Lady retyredthen to her chamber, attended on by none but Bajazeth himselfe, and asfamiliarly as if he had bene one of her women, shee no waycontradicting his bold intrusion, so farre had wine over-gone hersences, and prevailed against all modest bashfulnesse. These wantonembracings, strange to her that had never tasted them before, yetpleasing beyond measure, by reason of his treacherous advantage;afterward drew on many more of the ike carowsing meetings, withoutso much as thought of her passed miseries, or those more honourableand chaste respects, that ever ought to attend on Ladies.

　　Now, Fortune envying thus their stollen pleasures, and that shee,being the purposed wife of a potent King, should thus become thewanton friend of a much mean man, whose onely glory was her shame;altered the course of their too common pastimes, by preparing afarre greater infelicity for them. This Bajazeth had a Brother, agedabout five and twenty yeeres, of most compleate person, in the verybeauty of his time, and fresh as the sweetest smelling Rose, hebeing named Amurath. After he had once seene this Ladie (whose fairefeature pleased him beyond all womens else) shee seemed in his sodaineapprehension, both by her outward behaviour and civill apparancie,highly to deserve his verie best opinion, for she was not meanelyentred into his favour. Now hee found nothing to his hinderance, inobtaining the heighth of his hearts desire, but onely the strictcustodie and guard, wherein his brother Bajazeth kept her: whichraised a cruell conceite in his minde, wherein followed (not longafter) as cruell an effect.

　　It came to passe, that at the same time; in the Port of theCittie, called Caffa, there lay then a Ship laden with Merchandize,being bound thence for Smyrna, of which Ship two Geneway Merchants(being brethren) were the Patrons and Owners, who had givendirection for hoysing the sailes to depart thence when the windeshould serve. With these two Genewayes Amurath had covenanted, forhimselfe to goe aboord the ship the night ensuing, and the Lady in hiscompany. When night was come, having resolved with himselfe what wasto be done: in a disguised habite hee went to the house of Bajazeth,who stood not any way doubtfull of him, and with certaine of hismost faithfull Confederates (whom he had sworne to the intendedaction) they hid themselves closely in the house. After some part ofthe night was over-past, he knowing the severall lodgings both ofBajazeth and Alathiella, slew his brother soundly sleeping; andseizing on the Lady, whom he found awake and weeping, threatned tokill her also, if she made any noyse. So, being well furnished withthe greater part of worldly jewels belonging to Bajazeth, unheard orundescried by any body, they went presently to the Port, and there(without any further delay) Amurath and the Lady were received intothe Ship, but his companions returned backe againe; when the Mariners,having their sailes ready set, and the winde aptly fitting for them,lanched forth merrily into the maine.

　　You may well imagine, that the Ladie was extraordinarily afflictedwith greefe for her first misfortune; and now this second chancingso sodainely, must needs offend her in greater manner: but Amurath didso kindely comfort her with milde, modest, and manly perswasions, thatall remembrance of Bajazeth was quickely forgotten, and shee becameconverted to lovely demeanor, even when Fortune prepared a freshmiserie for her, as not satisfied with those whereof shee had tastedalready. The Lady being unequalled for beauty (as I said before) herbehaviour also in such exquisit and commendable kinde expressed; thetwo Brethren owners of the Ship, became so deeply enamored of her,that forgetting all their more serious affaires, they studied by allpossible meanes, to be pleasing and gracious in her eye, yet with sucha carefull carriage, that Amurath should neither see, or suspect it.

　　When the Brethren had imparted their loves extreamity each to theother, and plainely perceyved, that though they were equally intheir fiery torments, yet their desires were utterly contrary: theybegan severally to consider, that gaine gotten by Mirchandize,admitted an equall and honest division, but this purchase was of adifferent quality, pleading the title of a sole possession, withoutany partner or intruder. Fearefull and jealous were they both, leasteither should ayme at the others intention, yet willing enough toshake hands, in ridding Amurath out of the way, who onely was thehinderer of their hopes, Whereupon they concluded together, that ona day when the Ship sayled on very swiftly, and Amurath was sittingupon the Decke, studiously observing how the Billowes combatted eachwith other, and not suspecting any such treason in them towards him:stealing softly behinde him, sodainely they threw him into the Sea,the shippe floating on above halfe a Leagues distance, before anyperceived his fall into the Sea. When the Ladie heard thereof, and sawno likely meanes of recovering him againe, she fell to her wontedteares and lamentations: but the two Lovers came quickely to comforther, using kinde words and pithy perswasions (albeit she understoodthem not, or at the most very little) to appease the violence of herpassions; and, to speak uprightly, she did not so much emoane thelosse of Amurath, as the multiplying of her owne misfortunes, stillone succeeding in the necke of another. After divers long and welldelivered Orations, as also very faire and courteous behaviour, theyhad indifferently pacified her complainings: they beganne to discourseand commune with themselves, which of them had most right and title toAlathiella, and consequently ought to enjoy her. Now that Amurathwas gone, each pleaded his priviledge to bee as good as the others,both in the Ship, Goods, and all advantages else whatsoever happening:which the elder brother absolutely denied, alleadging first hispropriety of birth, a reason sufficient, whereby his younger oughtto give him place: Likewise, his right and interest both in the shipand goods, to be more then the others, as being heire to his father,and therefore in justice to be highest preferred. Last of all, thathis strength onely threw Amurath into the Sea, and therefore gavehim the full possession of his prize, no right at all remaining to hisbrother.

　　From temperate and calme speeches, they fell to frownes and ruderLanguage, which heated their blood in such violent manner, thatforgetting brotherly affection, and all respect of Parents or Friends,they drew forth their Ponyards, stabbing each other so often anddesperately, that before any in the shippe had the power or meanesto part them, both of them being very dangerously wounded, the youngerbrother fell downe dead: the elder being in little better case, byreceiving so many perilous hurts, remained (neverthelesse) living.This unhappy accident displeased the Lady very highly, seeing herselfe thus left alone, without the help or counsell of any bodie;and fearing greatly, least the anger of the two Brethrens Parentsand Friends, should now bee laide to her charge, and thereon followseverity of punishment. But the earnest entreaties of the woundedsurviver, and their arrivall at Smirna soone after, delivered him fromthe danger of death, gave some ease to her sorrow, and there withhim she went on shore.Remaining there with him in a common Inne, while he continued inthe Chirurgians cure, the fame of her singular and much admired beautywas soone spread abroad throughout all the City: and amongst the rest,to the hearing of the Prince of Ionia, who lately before (on veryurgent occasions) was come to Smyrna. This rare rumour, made himdesirous to see her, and after he had seene her, shee seemed farrefairer in his eye, then common report had noised her to be, andsuddenly grew so enamored of her, that she was the onely Idea of hisbest desires. Afterward, understanding in what manner shee was broughtthither, he devised how to make her his own, practising all possiblemeanes to accomplish it: which when the wounded Brothers Parents heardof, they not onely made tender of their willingnesse therein, but alsoimmediately sent her to him: a matter most highly pleasing to thePrince, and likewise to the Lady her selfe; because she thought now tobe freed from no meane perill, which (otherwise) the wounded Merchantsfriends might have inflicted uppon her.

　　The Prince perceiving, that beside her matchlesse beauty, shee hadthe true character of Royall behaviour; greeved the more, that hecould not be further informed of what Countrey shee was. His opinionbeing so stedfastly grounded, that (lesse then Noble) she could notbe, was a motive to set a keener edge on his affection towardes her,yet not to enjoy her as in honoirable and loving complement onely, butas his espoused Lady and Wife. Which appearing to her by apparantdemonstrations, though entercourse of speech wanted to confirme it;remembrance of her so many sad disasters, and being now in a mostnoble and respected condition, her comfort enlarged it selfe with asetled hope, her feares grew free from any more mollestations, and herbeauties became the onely theame and argument of private and publikeconference in all Natolia, that (well-neere) there was no otherdiscourse, in any Assembly whatsoever.

　　Heereupon the Duke of Athens, beeing young, goodly, and valiant ofperson as also a neere Kinsman to the Prince, had a desire to see her;and under colour of visiting his noble Kinsman, (as oftentimesbefore he had done) attended with an honourable traine, to Smirna hecame, being there most royally welcommed, and bounteously feasted.Within some few dayes of his there being, conference passed betweenethem, concerning the rare beauty of the Ladie; the Duke questioningthe Prince, whether shee was of such wonder, as fame had acquaintedthe World withall? Whereto the Prince replyed; Much more (Noblekinsman) then can bee spoken of, as your owne eyes shall witnesse,without crediting any words of mine. The Duke soliciting the Princethereto very earnestly, they both went together to see her; and shehaving before heard of their comming, adorned her selfe the moreMajestically, entertaining them with ceremonious demeanor (after herCountries custome) which gave most gracious and unspeakable acception.

　　At the Princes affable motion, shee sate downe betweene them,their delight being beyond expression, to behold her, but abridgedof much more felicitie, because they understood not any part of herLanguage: so that they could have no other conference, but by lookesand outward signes onely; and the more they beheld her, the morethey marvelled at her rare perfections, especially the Duke, whohardly credited that shee was a mortall creature. Thus not perceyving,what deepe carowses of amorous poyson his eyes dranke downe by themeere sight of her, yet thinking thereby onely to bee satisfied, heelost both himselfe and his best sences, growing in love (beyond allmeasure) with her. When the Prince and he were parted from her, andhee was at his owne private amorous- meditations in his Chamber, hereputed the Prince farre happier then any man else whatsoever, bythe enjoying of such a peerelesse beauty.

　　After many intricate and distracted cogitations, which molestedhis braines incessantly, regarding more his loves wanton heate, thenreason, kindred, and honourable hospitality; he resolutelydetermined (whatsoever ensued thereupon) to bereave the Prince ofhis faire felicity, that none but himselfe might possesse such atreasure, which he esteemed to bee the height of all happinesse. Hiscourage being conformable to his bad intent, with all hast it mustbe put in execution; so that equity, justice, and honesty, being quiteabandoned, nothing but subtile stratagems were now his meditations.

　　On a day, according to a fore-compacted treachery which he hadordered with a Gentleman of the Princes Chamber, who was namedChuriacy, he prepared his horses to be in readinesse, and dispatchedall his affaires else for a sodaine departure. The night following,hee was secretly conveyed by the said Churiacy, and a friend of hiswith him (being both armed) into the Princes Chamber, where he(while the Ladie was soundly sleeping) stood at a gazing windowtowards the Sea, naked in his shirt, to take the coole ayre, becausethe season was exceeding hot. Having formerly enstructed his friendwhat was to be done, very softly they stept to the Prince, and runningtheir weapons quite thorow his bodie, immediately they threw him forthof the window.

　　Here you are to observe, that the Pallace was seated on the Seashore, and verie high, and the Window whereat the Prince then stoodlooking foorth, was directly over divers houses, which the longcontinuance of time, and incessant beating on by the surges of theSea, had so defaced and ruined them, as seldome they were visited byany person; whereof the Duke having knowledge before, was the easierperswaded that the falling of the Princes body in so vast a place,could neither bee heard or descryed by any. The Duke and hisCompanion, having thus executed what they came for, proceeded yet intheir cunning a little further; casting a strangling Cord about thenecke of Churiacy, seemed as if they hugged and imbraced him: but drewit with so maine strength, that he never spake word after, and sothrew him downe after the Prince.

　　This done, and plainely perceiving that they were not heard orseene, either by the Lady, or any other: the Duke tooke a light in hishand, going on to the bed, where the Lady lay most sweetelysleeping; whom the more he beheld, the more he admired andcommended: but if in her garments shee appeared so pleasing, whatdid shee now in a bed of such state and Majestie? Being no way dauntedwith his so late committed sin, but swimming rather in surfet ofjoy, his hands all bloody, and his soule much more ugly; he laidehim downe on the bed by her, bestowing infinite kisses and embraces onher, she supposing him to be the Prince all this while, not openingher eyes to bee otherwise resolved. But this was not the delight heaymed at, neither did he thinke it safe for him, to delay time withany longer tarrying there: Wherefore, having his agents at hand fitand convenient for the purpose, they surprized her in such sort,that shee could not make any noyse or outcry, and carrying her throughthe same false posterne, whereat themselves had entred, laying herin a Princely litter; away they went with all possible speede, nottarrying in any place, untill they were arrived neere Athens. Butthither he would not bring her, because himselfe was a married man,but rather to a goodly Castle of his owne, not distant farre fromthe City; where he caused her to bee kept very secretly (to her nolittle greefe and sorrow) yet attended on and served in mosthonourable manner.

　　The Gentlemen usually attending on the Prince, having waited all thenext morning till noone, in expectation of his rising, and hearingno stirring in the Chamber, did thrust at the doore, which was butonely closed together, and finding no body there, they presentlyimagined, that he was privately gone to some other place, where(with the Ladie, whom he so deerely affected) hee might remaine somefew dayes for his more contentment, and so they rested verilyperswaded. Within some few dayes following, while no other doubtcame in question, the Princes Foole, entering by chance among theruined houses, where lay the dead bodies of the Prince and Churiacy:tooke hold of the cord about Churiacyes necke, and so went alongdragging it after him. The dead body being knowne to many, with nomeane mervaile how he should bee murthered in so vile manner: by giftsand faire perswasions they wonne him to bring them to the placewhere he found it. And there (to the no little greefe of the wholeCittie) they found the Princes body also, which they caused to beeintered with all the most Majesticke pompe that might be.

　　Upon further inquisition, who should commit horrid a deede,perceyving likewise that the Duke of Athens was not to be found, butwas closely gone: they judged (according to the truth) that he had hishand in this bloody businesse, and had carried away the Lady with him.Immediately, they elected the Princes brother to be their Lord andSoveraigne, inciting him to revenge so horrid a wrong, and promisingto assist him with their utmost power. The new chosen Prince beingassured afterward, by other more apparant and remarkeable proofes,that his people informed him With nothing but truth: sodainly, andaccording as they had concluded, with the help of neighbors, kindredand frends, collected from divers places; he mustred a good andpowerfull army, marching on towards Athens, to make war against theDuke.

　　No sooner heard he of this warlike preparation made against him, buthe likewise levied forces for his owne defence, and to his succourcame many great States: among whom, the Emperor of Constantinople senthis sonne Constantine, attended on by his Nephew Emanuell, withTroopes of faire and towardly force, who were honoutably welcommed andentertained by the Duke, but much more by the Dutchesse, becauseshee was their sister in Law.

　　Military provision thus proceeding on daily more and more, theDutches making choise of a fit and convenient houre, took these twoPrinces with her to a with-drawing Chamber; and there in flouds ofteares flowing from her eyes, wringing her hands, and sighingincessantly, she recounted the whole History, occasion of the warre,and how dishonourably the Duke dealt with her about this strangewoman, whom hee purposed to keepe in despight of her, as thinking thatshe knew nothing therof, and complaining very earnestly unto them,entreated that for the Dukes honour, and her comfort, they wouldgive their best assistance in this case.

　　The two young Lords knew all this matter, before shee thusreported it to them; and therefore, without staying to listen [to] herany longer, but comforting her so wel as they could, with promise oftheir best emploied paines: being informd by her, in what place theLady was so closely kept they took their leave, and parted from her.Often they had heard the Lady much commended, and her incomparablebeauty highly extolled, yea even by the Duke himselfe; which made themthe more desirous to see her: wherfore earnestly they solicited him tolet them have a sight of her, and he (forgetting what happened tothe Prince, by shewing her so unadvisedly to him) made them promise togrant their request. Causing a very magnificent dinner to be prepared,and in a goodly garden, at the Castle where the Lady was kept: onthe morrow, attended on by a smal traine, away they rode to dinewith her.

　　Constantine being seated at the Table, hee began (as oneconfounded with admiration) to observe her judiciously, affirmingsecretly to his soule that he had never seene so compleat a womanbefore; and allowing it for justice, that the Duke or any otherwhosoever, if (to enjoy so rare a beauty) they had committedtreason, or any mischeefe els beside, yet in reason they ought to beheld excused. Nor did he bestow so many lookes upon her, but hispraises infinitely surpassed them, as thinking that he could notsufficiently commend her, following the Duke step by step inaffection; for being now growne amorous of her, and remembrance of theintended warre utterly abandoned; no other thoughts could comeneerer him but how to bereave the Duke of her, yet concealing hislove, and not imparting it to any one.

　　While his fancies were thus amorously set on fire, the time came,that they must make head against the Prince, who already wasmarching with in the Dukes dominions: wherfore the Duke,Constantine, and all the rest, according to a counsel held among them,went to defend certaine of the Frontiers, to the end that the Princemight passe no further. Remaining there divers dayes together,Constantine (who could thinke on nothing else but the beautifulLady) considered with himself, that while the Duke was now so farrefrom her, it was an easie matter to compasse his intent: Hereupon, thebetter to colour his present returne to Athens, he seemed to besurprized with a sudden extreame sicknesse, in regard whereof (bythe Dukes free license, and leaving all his power to his CosenEmanuel) forthwith he journyed backe to Athens. After someconference had with his sister, about her dishonourable wrongs enduredat his hands onely, by the Lady, he solemnly protested, that if shewere so pleased, hee would aide her powerfully in the matter, bytaking her from the place where shee was, and never more afterward, tobe seene in that Country any more.

　　The Dutchesse being faithfully perswaded, that he would do thisonely for her sake, and not in any affection he bare to the Lady,answered, that it highly pleased her; alwayes provided, that itmight be performed in such sort, as the Duke her husband shouldnever understand, that ever she gave any consent thereto; whichConstantine sware unto her by many deepe oaths, whereby she referredall to his owne disposition. Constantine heereupon secretly preparedin a readinesse a subtile Barke, sending it in an evening, neere tothe Garden where the Lady resorted; having first informed the peoplewhich were in it, fully what was to be done. Afterwards, accompaniedwith some other of his attendants, he went to the Palace to theLady, where he was gladly entertained, not onely by such as waytedon her, but also by the Lady her selfe.

　　Leading her along by the arme towards the Garden, attended on by twoof her servants, and two of his owne; seeming as if he was sent fromthe Duke, to conferre with her: they walked alone to a Port opening onthe Sea, which standing ready open, upon a signe given by him to oneof his complices, the Barke was brought close to the shore; and theLadie being sodainly seized on, was immediately conveyed into it;and he returning backe to her people, with his sword drawne, said: Letno man stirre, or speake a word, except he be willing to loose hislife: for I intend not to rob the Duke of his faire friend, but toexpell the shame and dishonor that he hath offered to my Sister: noone being so hardy as to returne him any answer. Aboord wentConstantine with his consorts, and sitting neere to the Lady, whowrung her hands, and wept bitterly; he commaunded the Mariners tolaunch forth, flying away on the wings of the winde, till about thebreake of day following, they arrived at Melasso. There they tookelanding, and reposed on shore for some few dayes, Constantinelabouring to comfort the Lady, even as if she had bene his owneSister, shee having good cause to curse her infortunate beauty.

　　Going aboord the Barke againe, within few dayes they came toSetalia, and there fearing the reprehension of his father, and leastthe Lady should be taken from him; it pleased Constantine to makehis stay, as in a place of no meane security. And (as before) aftermuch kinde behaviour used towards the Lady, without any meanes inher selfe to redresse the least of all these great extremities, shebecame more milde and affable, for discontentment did not a jot quaileher.

　　While occurrences passed on in this manner, it fortuned, that Osbechthe King of Turky (who was in continuall war with the Emperour) cameby accident to Lajazzo: and hearing there how lasciviously Constantinespent his time in Setalia, with a Lady which he had stolne, beingbut weake and slenderly guarded; in the night with certaine wellprovided ships, his men and he entred the town, and surprized manypeople in their beds, before they knew of their enimies comming,killing such as stood upon their defence against them, (among whom wasConstantine) and burning the whole Towne, brought their booty andprisoners aboord their Shippes, wherewith they returned backe toLajazzo. Being thus come to Lajazzo, Osbech who was a brave andgallant young man, upon a review of the pillage, found the faire Lady,whom he knew to be the beloved of Constantine, because shee wasfound lying on his bed. Without any further delay, he made choice ofher to be his wife; causing his nuptials to be honourablysolemnized, and many moneths he lived there in great joy with her.

　　But before occasions grew to this effect, the Emperour made aconfederacie with Bassano, King of Cappadocia, that hee should descendwith his forces, one way upon Osbech, and he would assault him withhis power on the other. But he could not so conveniently bring this topasse, because the Emperour would not yeeld to Bassano, in anyunreasonable matter he demanded. Neverthelesse, when hee understoodewhat had happened to his Sonne (for whom his greefe was beyond allmeasure) hee graunted the King of Cappadociaes request; soliciting himwith all instancy, to be the more speedy in assayling Osbech. It wasnot long, before hee heard of this conjuration made against him; andtherefore hee speedily mustered up all his forces, ere he would beencompassed by two such potent kings, and marched on to meete the Kingof Cappadocia, leaving his Ladie and Wife (for her safety) at Lajazzo,in the custodie of a true and loyall Servant of his.

　　Within a short while after, he drew neere the Campe belonging to theKing of Cappadocia, where boldly he gave him battell; chancing thereinto be slaine, his Army broken and discomfited, by meanes whereof,the King of Cappadocia remaining Conquerour, marched on towardesLajazzo, every one yeelding him obeysance all the way as he went. Inthe meane space, the servant to Osbech, who was named Antiochus, andwith whom the faire Ladie was left in guard; although hee was aged,yet seeing shee was so extraordinarily beautifull, he fell in lovewith her, forgetting the solemne vowes he had made to his master.One happinesse he had in this case to helpe him, namely, that heunderstood and could speake her Language: a matter of no meane comfortto her, who constrainedly had lived divers yeeres together, in thestate of a deafe or dumbe Woman, because every where else theyunderstoode her not, nor shee them, but by shewes and signes.

　　This benefite of familiar conference, beganne to embolden his hopes,elevate his courage, and make him seeme more youthfull in his owneopinion, then any ability of body could speake unto him, or promisehim in the possession of her, who was so farre beyond him, and sounequall to be enjoyed by him; yet to advance his hopes a greatdeale higher, Newes came, that Osbech was vanquished and slaine, andthat Bassano made every where havocke of all: whereon they concludedtogether, not to tarrie there any longer, but storing themselveswith the goods of Osbech, secretly they departed thence to Rhodes.Being : g seated there in some indifferent abiding, it came topasse, that Antiochus fell into a deadly sickenesse, to whom came aCyprian Merchant, one much esteemed by him, as beeing an intimatefriend and kinde acquaintance, and in whom hee reposed no smallconfidence. Feeling his sickenesse to encrease more and more uponhim dayly, hee determined, not onely to leave such wealth as hee hadto this Merchant, but the faire Lady likewise. And calling them bothto his beds side, he spake in this manner.

　　Deere Love, and my most worthily respected friend, I perceiveplainly and infallibly, that I am drawing neere unto my end, whichmuch discontenteth me; because my hope was to have lived longer inthis world, for the enjoying of your kinde and most esteemedcompany. Yet one thing maketh my death very pleasing and welcome tome; namely, that lying thus in my bed of latest comfort in thislife, I shall expire and finish my course, in the armes of those twopersons, whome I most affected in all this world, as you myever-deerest friend, and you faire Lady, whom (since the very firstsight of you) I loved and honoured in my soule. Irkesome and veriegreevous it is to me, that (if I dye) I shall leave you here astranger, without the counsaile and helpe of any bodie: and yet muchmore offensive would it become, if I had not such a friend as youheere present, who (I am faithfully perswaded) will have the like careand respect of her (even for my sake) as of my selfe, if time hadallotted my longer tarrying here. And therefore (worthy friend) mostearnestly I desire you, that if I dye, all mine affaires and she mayremaine to your trustie care, as being (by my selfe) absolutelycommended to your providence, and so to dispose both of the one andother, as may best agree with the comfort of my soule. As for you(choice beauty) I humbly entreate, that after my death you would notforget me, to the end, I may make my vaunt in another world, that Iwas affected here by the fairest Lady that ever Nature framed. If ofthese two things you will give mee assurance, I shall depart fromyou with no meane comfort.

　　The friendly Merchant, and likewise the Ladie, hearing thesewords, wept both bitterly: and after hee had given over speaking,kindely they comforted him, with promises and solemne Vowes, that ifhee dyed, all should be performed which hee had requested. Within ashort while after, he departed out of this life, and they gave himverie honourable buriall, according to that Country custome. Whichbeing done, the Merchant dispatching all his affaires at Rhodes, wasdesirous to returne home to Cyprus, in a Carracke of the Catelans thenthere being: mooving the Ladie in the matter, to understand how sheestoode enclined, because urgent occasions called him thence to Cyprus.The Lady made answere, that shee was willing to passe thither withhim, hoping for the love hee bare to deceased Antiochus, that heewould respect her as his Sister. The Merchant was willing to giveher any contentment, but yet resolved her, that under the title ofbeing his Sister, it would be no warrant of securitie to them both.Wherefore, hee rather advised her, to stile him as her husband, and hewould terme her his Wife, and so hee should be sure to defend her fromall injuries whatsoever.

　　Being aboord the Carrack, they had a Cabine and small bedconveniently allowed them, where they slept together, that theymight the better be reputed as man and wife; for, to passeotherwise, would have beene very dangerous to them both. Andquestionlesse, their faithfull promise made at Rhodes to Antiochus,sickenesse on the Sea, and mutuall respect they had of each otherscredit, was a constant restraint to all wanton desires, and a motiverather to incite Chastitie, then otherwise, and so (I hope) you areperswaded of them. But howsoever, the windes blewe merrily, theCarracke sayled lustily, and (by this time) they are arrived at Baffa,where the Cyprian Merchant dwelt, and where shee continued a longwhile with him, no one knowing otherwise, but that shee was his wifeindeede.Now it fortuned, that there arrived also at the same Baffa (aboutsome especiall occasions of his) a Gentleman whose name was Antigonus,well stept into yeeres, and better stored with wisedome then wealth:because by medling in many matters, while hee followed the serviceof the King of Cyprus, Fortune had beene very adverse to him. Thisancient Gentleman, passing (on a day) by the house where the Lady lay,and the Merchant being gone about his bussinesse into Armenia: heechanced to see the Lady at a window of the house, and because shee wasvery beautifull, he observed her the more advisedly, recollectinghis sences together, that (doubtlesse) he had seene her before, but inwhat place hee could not remember. The Lady her selfe likewise, whohad so long time beene Fortunes tennis ball, and the terme of her manymiseries drawing now neere an ending: began to conceive (upon the veryfirst sight of Antigonus) that she had formerly seene him inAlexandria, serving her Father in place of great degree. Heereupon,a sodaine hope perswaded her, that by the advice and furtherance ofthis Gentleman, shee should recover her wonted Royall condition: andopportunity now aptly fitting her, by the absence of her pretendedMerchant-husband, shee sent for him, requesting to have a few wordswith him.

　　When he was come into the house, she bashfully demanded of him, ifhe was not named Antigonus of Famagosta, because she knew one like himso called? He answered that he was so named: saying moreover, Madam methinkes I should know you, but I cannot remember where I have seeneyou, wherefore I would entreat (if it might stand with your goodliking) that my memory might be quickned with better knowledge of you.The Lady perceiving him to be the man indeed, weeping incessantly, shethrew her armes about his necke, and soone after asked Antigonus(who stood as one confounded with mervaile) if he had never seeneher in Alexandria? Upon these words, Antigonus knew her immediately tobe Alathiella, daughter to the great Soldane, who was supposed (longsince) to be drowned in the Sea: and offering to do her such reverenceas became him, she would not permit him, but desired that he would beeassistant to her, and willed him also to sit downe awhile by her.

　　A goodly chaire being brought him, in very humble maner hedemanded of her, what had become of her in so long a time, becauseit was verily beleeved throughout all Egypt, that she was drowned inthe Sea. I would it had bin so, answered the Lady, rather then toleade such a life as I have done; and I thinke my Father himselfewould wish it so, if ever he should come to the knowledge thereof.With these words the teares rained downe her faire cheekes:wherefore Antigonus thus spake unto hir. Madam, discomfort not yourselfe before you have occasion; but (if you be so pleased) relate yourpassed accidents to me, and what the course of your life hath bene:perhaps, I shall give you such friendly advice as may stand youinsted, and no way be injurious to you.

　　Fetching a sighe, even as if her heart would have split in sunder,thus she replyed.

　　Ah Antigonus, me thinkes when I looke on thee, I seeme to beholdmy royall Father, and therefore mooved with the like religious zealeand charitable love, as in duty I owe unto him: I wil make known tothee, what I rather ought to conceale and hide from any person living.I know thee to be honourable, discreete, and truely wise, though Iam a fraile, simple, and weake woman, therefore I dare discover tothee, rather then any other that I know, by what strange andunexpected misfortunes I have lived so long obscurely in the world.And if in thy great and grave judgement (after the hearing of mymany miseries) thou canst any way restore me to my former estate, Ipray thee do it: but if thou perceive it impossible to be done, asearnestly likewise I entreate thee, never to reveale to any livingperson, that either thou hast seene mee, or heard any speech of me.After these words, the teares still streaming from her faire eyes, sherecounted the whole passage of her rare mishappes, even from hershipwracke in the sea of Majorica, untill that very instant houre;speaking them in such harsh manner as they hapned, and not sparing anyjot of them.

　　Antigonus being mooved to much compassion, declared how hee pitiedher by his teares; and having bene silent an indifferent while, asconsidering in this case what was best to be done, thus he began.Madam, seeing you have past through such a multitude of misfortunes,yet undiscovered, what and who you are: I will render you asblamelesse to your Father, and estate you as fairely in his love, asat the houre when you parted from him, and afterward make you wifeto the King of Colchos. Shee demanding of him, by what meanes possiblythis could be accomplished, breefely he made it knowne to her, how,and in what manner he would performe it.

　　To cut off further tedious circumstances, forthwith he returned toFamagosta, and going before the King of the country, thus he spaketo him. Sir, you may (if so you will be pleased) in an instant, dome an exceeding honor, who have bene impoverished by your service, andalso a deed of great renowne to your selfe, without any much matter ofexpence and cost. The King demanding how? Antigonus thus answered. Thefaire daughter of the Soldane, so generally reported to be drowned, isarrived at Baffa, and to preserve her honor from blemishing, hathsuffered many crosses and calamities: being at this instant in verypoore estate, yet desirous to revisite her father. If you please tosend her home under my conduct, it will be great honour to you, and nomeane benefite to me: which kindnesse will for ever be thankfullyremembred by the Soldan.

　　The King in royall magnificence, replied sodainly, that he washighly pleased with these good tydings; and having sent honorablyfor hir from Baffa, with great pompe she was conducted to Famagosta,and there most graciously welcommed both by the King and Queene,with solemne triumphes, bankets, and revelling, performed in mostMajesticke manner. Being questioned by the King and Queene, concerningso large a time of strange misfortunes: according as Antigonus hadformerly enstructed her, so did she shape the forme of her answers,and satisfied (with honor) all their demands. So, within few daiesafter, upon her earnest and instant request, with an honourable traineof Lords and Ladies, shee was sent thence, and conducted all the wayby Antigonus, untill she came unto the Soldans Court.

　　After some few dayes of her reposing there, the Soldan wasdesirous to understand, how she could possibly live so long in anyKingdome or Province whatsoever, and yet no knowledge to be taken ofher? The Lady, who perfectly retained by heart, and had all herlessons at her fingers ends, by the warie instruction whichAntigonus had given her, answered her father in this manner. Sir,about the twentieth day after my departure from you, a very terribleand dreadfull tempest overtooke us, so that in dead time of the night,our ship being split in sunder upon the sands, neere to a place calledVarna, what became of all the men that were aboord, I neither know,nor ever heard of. Onely I remember, then when death appeared, and Ibeing recovered from death to life, certaine Pezants of theCountrey, comming to get what they could finde in the ship sowrackt, I was first (with two of my women) brought and set safely onthe shore.

　　No sooner were we there, but certaine rude shagge-haird villainesset upon us, carrying away from me both my women, then haling me alongby the haire of my head: neither teares or intercessions could drawany pitty from them. As thus they dragd me into a spacious Wood, fourehorsemen on a sodaine came riding by, who seeing how dishonourably thevillaines used me, rescued me from them, and forced them to flight.But the foure horsemen, seeming (in my judgement) to bee persons ofpower and authority, letting them go, came to me; urging sundryquestions to me, which neither I understood, or they mine answeres.After many deliberations held among themselves, setting me upon one oftheir horses, they brought me to a Monasterie of religious women,according to the custome of their Law: and there, whatsoever theydid or sayde, I know not, but I was most benignely welcommedthither, and honoured of them extraordinarily; where (with them inDevotion) I dedicated my selfe to the Goddesse of chastity, who ishighly reverenced and regarded among the women of that Countrey, andto her religious service they are wholly addicted.

　　After I had continued some time among them, and learned a littleof their language; they asked me, of whence, and what I was. Reasongave me so much understanding, to be fearefull of telling them thetrueth, for feare of expulsion from among them, as an enemy to theirLaw and Religion: wherefore I answered (according as necessitie urged)that I was daughter to a Gentleman of Cyprus who sent me to beemarried in Candie; but our fortunes (meaning such as had the charge ofme) fell out quite contrary to our expectation, by losses, shipwracke,and other mischances; adding many matters more beside, onely in regardof feare, and yeelding obediently to observe their customes.

　　At length, she that was in cheefest preheminence among these Women(whom they termed by the name of their Ladie Abbesse) demaunded ofmee, whether I was willing to abide in that condition of life, or toreturne home againe into, Cyprus. I answerd, that I desired nothingmore. But shee, being very carefull of mine honour, would never reposeconfidence in any that came for Cyprus, till two honest Gentlemen ofFrance who hapned thither about two moneths since, accompanied withtheir wives, one of them being a neere kinswoman to the LadyAbbesse. And she well knowing, that they travelled in pilgrimage toJerusalem, to visite the holy Sepulcher, where (as they beleeve)that he whom they held for their God was buried, after the jewes hadput him to death; recommended me to their loving trust, with especiallcharge, for delivering mee to my Father in Cyprus. What honourablelove and respect I found in the company of those Gentlemen and theirWives, during our voyage backe to Cyprus, the historie would beovertedious in reporting, neither is it much materiall to our purpose,because your demaund is to another end.

　　Sayling on prosperously in our Ship, it was not long before wearrived at Baga, where being landed, and not knowing any person,neither what I should say to the Gentlemen, who onely were carefullfor delivering me to my Father, according as they were charged bythe reverend Abbesse: it was the will of heaven doubtlesse (in pittyand compassion of my passed disasters) that I was no sooner come onshore at Baffa, but I should there haply meet with Antigonus, whom Icalled unto in our Country language because I would not beunderstood by the Gentlemen nor their wives, requesting him toacknowledge me as his daughter. Quickly he apprehended mine intention,accomplishing what requested, and (according to his poore power)most bounteously feasted the Gentlemen and their wives, conductingme to the King of Cyprus, who received me royally, and sent me home toyou with so much honour, as I am no way able to relate. What elseretnaineth to be said, Antigonus who hath oft heard the whole story ofmy misfortunes, at better leysure will report.

　　Antigonus then turning to the Soldan, saide: My Lord, as shee hathoften told me, and by relation both of the Gentlemen and theirwives, she hath delivered nothing but truth. Onely shee hath forgottensomewhat worth the speaking, as thinking it not fit for her toutter, because indeed it is not so convenient for her. Namely, howmuch the Gentlemen and their wives (with whom she came) commendedthe rare honesty and integrity of life, as also the unspotted vertuewherein shee lived among those chaste religious women, as theyconstantly (both with teares and solemne protestations) avouched tome, when kindly they resigned their charge to me. Of all whichmatters, and many more beside, if I should make discourse to yourExcellencie; this whole day, the night ensuing, and the next daiesfull extendure, are not sufficient to acquaint you withall. Let itsuffice then that I have said so much, as (both by the reports, andmine owne understanding) may give you faithfull assurance, to makeyour Royall vaunt, of having the fairest, most vertuous, and honestLady to your daughter, of any King or Prince whatsoever.

　　The Soldane was joyfull beyond all measure, welcomming both himand the rest in most stately manner, oftentimes entreating the Godsvery heartily, that he might live to requite them with equallrecompence, who had so graciously honored his daughter: but aboveall the rest, the King of Cyprus, who sent her home so Majestically.And having bestowne great gifts on Antigonus, within a few dayesafter, hee gave him leave to returne to Cyprus: with thankfull favoursto the King as well by Letters, as also by Ambassadours expresselysent, both from himselfe and his Daughter.

　　When as this businesse was fully finished, the Soldane, desiringto accomplish what formerly was intended and begun, namely, that shemight be wife to the King of Colchos; hee gave him intelligence of allthat had happened; writing moreover to him, that (if he were sopleased) he wold yet send her in Royall manner to him. The King ofColchos was exceeding joyfull of these glad tydings, and dispatching aworthy traine to fetch her, she was conveyed thither very pompously,and she who had bene imbraced by so many, was received by him as anhonest Virgin, living long time after with him in much joy andfelicity. And therefore it hath bene saide as a common Proverbe: Themouth well kist comes not short of good Fortune, but is stillrenewed like the Moone.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE EIGHT NOVELL

　　WHEREBY ALL MEN MAY PLAINELY UNDERSTAND, THAT LOYALTY

　　FAITHFULLY KEPT TO THE PRINCE (WHAT PERILS SOEVER DOE ENSUE)

　　DOTH YET NEVERTHELESSE RENOWNE A MAN, AND BRING HIM TO FARRE

　　GREATER HONOUR

　　The Count D'Angiers being falsly accused, was banished out ofFrance, and left his two children in England in divers places.Returning afterward (unknowne) thorow Scotland, hee found themadvanced unto great dignitie. Then, repayring in the habite of aServitour, into the King of France his Armie, and his innocenciemade publiquely knowne, hee was reseated in his former honourabledegree.

　　The Ladies sighed verie often, hearing the variety of wofullmiseries happening to Alathiella: but who knoweth, what occasionmooved them to those sighes? Perhappes there were some among them, whorather sighed they could not be so often maried as she was, ratherthen for any other compassion they had of her disasters. But leavingthat to their owne construction, they smiled merrily at the lastspeeches of Pamphilus: and the Queene perceyving the Novell to beended, shee fixed her eye upon Madame Eliza, as signifying thereby,that she was next to succeed in order; which shee joyfullyembracing, spake as followeth. The field is very large and spacious,wherein all this day we have walked, and there is not any one hereso wearied with running the former races, but nimbly would adventureon as many more, so copious are the alterations of Fortune, in sadrepetition of her wonderfull changes: and among the infinity of hervarious courses, I must make addition of another, which I trust,will no way discontent you.

　　When the Romaine Empire was translated from the French to theGermaines, mighty dissentions grew betweene both the Nations,insomuch, that it drew a dismall and a lingering warre. In whichrespect, as well for the safety of his owne Kingdome, as to annoyand disturbe his enemies; the King of France and one of his sonnes,having congregated the forces of their owne Dominions, as also oftheir friends and confederates, they resolved manfully to encountertheir enemies. But before they would adventure any rash proceeding,they held it as the cheefest part of policy and royall providence, notto leave the State without a Chiefe or Governour. And having hadgood experience of Gualtier, Count D'Angiers, to be a wise andworthy Lord, singularly expert in military discipline and faithfull inall affaires of the Kingdome (yet fitter for ease and pleasure, thenlaborious toyle and travalle:) he was elected Lieutenant Governourin their sted, over the whole kingdom of France, and then they went onin their enterprize.

　　Now began the Count to execute the office committed to his trust, byorderly proceeding, and with great discretion, yet not entering intoany businesse, without consent of the Queene and her faire daughter inLaw: who although they were left under his care and custodie, yet(notwithstanding) he honoured them as his superiours, and as thedignity of their quality required. Here you are to observe, concerningCount Gualtier himselfe, that he was a most compleate person, agedlitle above forty yeeres, as affable and singularly conditioned, asany Nobleman possibly could be, nor did those times affoord aGentleman, that equalled him in all respects. It fortuned, that theKing and his sonne being busy in the aforenamed war, the wife and Ladyof Count Gualtier died in the mean while, leaving him onely a sonneand a daughter very yong, and of tender yeeres, which made his ownehome the lesse welcom to him, having lost his deere Love, and secondselfe.

　　Heereupon, he resorted to the Court of the said Ladies the morefrequently, often conferring with them, about the waighty affairesof the Kingdome: in which time of so serious interparlance, theKings sonnes wife, threw many affectionate regards upon him, convayingsuch conspiring passions to her heart (in regard of his person andvertues) that her love exceeded all capacity of governement. Herdesires out-stepping al compasse of modesty, or the dignity of herPrincely condition, throwes off all regard of civill and soberthoughts, and guides her into a Labyrinth of wanton imaginations. For,she regards not now the eminency of his high Authority, his gravity ofyeares, and those parts that are the true conducts to honour: butlookes upon her owne loose and lascivious appetite, her young,gallant, and over-ready yeelding nature, comparing them with hiswant of a wife, and likely hope thereby of her sooner prevailing;supposing, that nothing could be her hindrance, but onely bashfullshamefastnesse, which she rather chose utterly to forsake and setaside, then to faile of her hot enflarned affection, and therefore shewould needs be the discoverer of her owne disgrace.

　　Upon a day, being alone by her selfe, and the time seemingsuteable to her intention: shee sent for the Count, under colour ofsome other important conference with him. The Count D'Aongiers,whose thoughts were quite contrary to hers: immediately went to her,where they both sitting downe together on a beds side in herChamber, according as formerly shee had plotted her purpose; twice heedemaunded of her, upon what occasion she had thus sent for him. Shesitting a long while silent, as if she had no answere to make him,pressed by the violence of her amorous passions, a Vermillion tinctureleaping up into her face, yet shame enforcing teares from her eyes,with words broken and halfe confused, at last she began to deliver herminde in this manner.

　　Honourable Lord, and my deerely respected Friend, being so wise aman as you are, it is no difficult matter for you to know, what afrayle condition is imposed both on men and women; yet (for diversoccasions) much more upon the one, then the other. Whereforedesertfully, in the censure of a just and upright judge, a fault ofdivers conditions (in respect of the person) ought not to bee censuredwith one and the same punnishment. Beside, who will not say, that aman or woman of poore and meane estate, having no other helpe formaintainance, but laborious travaile of their bodies, shouldworthily receive more sharpe reprehension, in yeelding to amorousdesires, or such passions as are incited by love; then a wealthyLady whose living relieth not on her pains or cares, neither wantethany thing that she can wish to have: I dare presume, that you yourselfe will allow this to be equall and just. In which respect, I am ofthe minde, that the fore-named allegations, ought to serve as asufficient excuse, yea, and to the advantage of her who is sopossessed, if the passions of love should over-reach her: alwayesprovided, that shee can pleade in her owne defence, the choice of awise and vertuous friend, answerable to her owne condition andquality, and no way to be taxt with a servile or vile election.

　　These two speciall observations, allowable in my judgement, andliving now in mee, seizing on my youthfull blood and yeeres, havefound no mean inducement to love, in regard of my husbands fardistance from me, medling in the rude uncivill actions of warre,when he should rather be at home in more sweet imployment. You seeSir, that these Oratours advance themselves here in your presence,to acquaint you with the extremity of my over-commanding agony: and ifthe same power hath dominion in you, which your discretion(questionlesse) cannot be voide of; then let me entreate such advicefrom you, as may rather helpe, then hinder my hopes. Beleeve it thenfor trueth Sir, that the long absence of my husband from me, thesolitary condition wherein I am left, il agreeing with the hot bloodrunning in my veines, and the temper of my earnest desires: have soprevailed against my strongest resistances, that not onely so weakea woman as I am, but any man of much more potent might, (living inease and idlenesse as I do) cannot withstand such continuall assaults,having no other helpe then flesh and blood.

　　Nor am I so ignorant, but publike knowledge of such an error in mee,would be reputed a shrewd taxation of honesty: whereas (on the otherside) secret carriage, and heedfull managing such amorous affaires,may passe for currant without any reproach. And let me tel you,noble Count, that I repute love highly favourable to mee, by guidingmy judgement with such moderation, to make election of a wise, worthy,and honorable friend, fit to enjoy the grace of a farre greater Ladythen I am, and the first letter of his name, is the Count D'Angiers.For if error have not misled mine eye, as in love no Lady can beeasily deceived: for person, perfections, and all parts most to beecommended in a man, the whole Realme of France containeth not yourequall. Observe beside, how forward Fortune sheweth her selfe to usboth in this case; you to bee destitute of a wife, as I am of anhusband; for I account him as dead to me, when he denies me the dutiesbelonging to a wife. Wherefore, in regard of the unfained affectionI beare you, and compassion which you ought to have of a RoyallPrincesse, even almost sicke to death for your sake, I earnestlyentreat you, not to deny mee your loving society, but pittying myyouth and fiery affections (never to be quenched but by yourkindnesse) I may enjoy my hearts desire.

　　As shee uttered these words, the teares streamed aboundantly downeher faire cheekes, preventing her of any further speech: so thatdejecting her head into her bosome, overcome with the predominanceof her passions, she fell upon the Counts knee, whereas else sheehad falne uppon the ground. When he, like a loyall and most honourableman, sharpely reprehended her fond and idle love: And when sheewould have embraced him about the necke to have kissed him; herepulsed her roughly from him, protesting upon his honourablereputation, that rather then hee would so wrong his Lord andMaister, he would endure a thousand deaths.

　　The Ladie seeing her desire disappointed, and her fond expectationutterly frustrated: grew instantly forgetfull of her intemperate love,and falling into extremity of rage, converted her former gentle andloving speeches, into this harsh and ruder language. Villaine (quothshe) shall the longing comforts of my life, be abridged by thy baseand scornefull deniall? Shall my destruction be wrought by thy mostcurrish unkindenesse, and all my hoped joyes be defeated in amoment? Know Slave, that I did not so earnestly desire thy sweeteembracements before, but now as deadly I hate and despise them;which either thy death or banishment shall deerely pay for. Nosooner had she thus spoken, but tearing her haire, and renting hergarments in peeces, she ranne about like a distracted Woman, cryingout alowd; Helpe, helpe, the Count D'Angiers will forcibly dishonourmee, the lustfull Count will violate mine honour.

　　D'Angiers seeing this, and fearing more the malice of theover-credulous Court, then either his owne Conscience, or anydishonourable act by him committed, beleeving likewise, that herslanderous accusation would be credited, above his true andspotlesse innocency: closely he conveyed himselfe out of the Court,making what hast he could, home to his owne house, which being tooweake for warranting his safety upon such pursuite as would be usedagainst him, without any further advice or counsell, he seated his twochildren on horsebacke, himselfe also being but meanly mounted, thusaway thence he went to Calice.

　　Upon the clamour and noise of the Lady, the Courtiers quicklyflocked thither; and, as lies soone winne beleefe in hasty opinions,upon any silly or shallow surmise: so did her accusation passe forcurrant, and the Counts advancement being envied by many, made hishonest carriage (in this case) the more suspected. In hast and maddingfury, they ran to the Counts houses, to arrest his person, and carryhim to prison: but when they could not finde him, they raced hisgoodly buildings downe to the ground, and used all shamefullviolence to them. Now, as ill newes sildome wants a speedyMessenger; so, in lesse space then you will imagine, the King andDolphin heard thereof in the Campe,-and were therewith so highlyoffended, that the Count had a sodaine and severe condemnation, allhis progeny being sentenced with perpetuall exile, and promises ofgreat and bountifull rewards, to such as could bring his body alive ordead.

　　Thus the innocent Count, by his overhasty and sodaine flight, madehimselfe guilty of this foule imputation: and arriving at Callice withhis children, their poore and homely habites, hid them from beingknowne, and thence they crossed over into England, staying no whereuntill hee came to London. Before he would enter into the City, hegave divers good advertisements to his children, but especially twoprecepts above all the rest. First, with patient soules to support thepoore condition, whereto Fortune (without any offence in him orthem) had thus dejected them. Next, that they should have mostheedfull care, at no time to disclose from whence they came, orwhose children they were, because it extended to the perill of theirlives. His Sonne, being named Lewes, and now about nine yeares old,his Daughter called Violenta, and aged seaven yeares, did both observetheir fathers direction, as afterward it did sufficiently appeare. Andbecause they might live in the safer securitie, hee thought it for thebest to change their names, calling his Sonne Perotto, and hisDaughter Gianetta, for thus they might best escape unknowne.

　　Being entred into the City, and in the poore estate of beggars, theycraved every bodies mercy and almes. It came to passe, that standingone morning at the Cathedrall Church doore, a great Lady of Englandbeing then wife to the Lord high Marshal, comming forth of the Church,espied the Count and his children there begging. Of him she demandedwhat Countrey-man he was? and whether those children were his owne, orno? The Count replyed, that he was borne in Piccardy, and for anunhappy fact committed by his eldest Sonne (a stripling of morehopefull expectation, then proved) hee was enforced, with those histwo other children, to forsake his country. The Lady being by naturevery pittifull, looking advisedly on the young Girle beganne to growin good liking of her; because (indeede) she was amiable, gentle,and beautifull, whereupon shee saide. Honest man, thy daughter hatha pleasing countenance, and (perhaps) her inward disposition mayproove answerable to her outward good parts: if therefore thou canstbee content to leave her with me, I will give her entertainment, andupon her dutifull carriage and behaviour, if she live to such yearesas may require it, I will have her honestly bestowne in marriage. Thismotion was very pleasing to the Count, who readily declared hiswilling consent thereto, and with the teares trickling downe hischeekes, in thankfull maner he delivered his pretty daughter to theLady.

　　She being thus happily bestowne, he minded to tarry no longer inLondon; but, in his wonted begging manner, travailing thorough theCountry with his sonne Perotto, at length he came into Wales: butnot without much weary paine and travell, being never used before,to journey so far on foot. There dwelt another Lord, in office ofMarshalship to the King of England, whose power extended over thoseparts: a man of very great authority, keeping a most noble andbountifull house, which they termed the President of Wales hisCourt; whereto the Count and his Son oftentimes resorted, as findingthere good releefe and comfort. On a day, one of the Presidentssons, accompanied with divers other Gentlemens children, wereperforming certaine youthfull sports, and pastimes, as running,leaping, and such like, wherein Perotto presumed to make one amongthem, excelling all the rest in such commendable manner, as none ofthem came any thing nere him. Divers times the President had takennotice thereof, and was so well pleased with the Lads behaviour,that he enquired of whence he was? Answere was made, that he was apoore mans Son, that every day came for an almes to his gate.

　　The President being desirous to make the boy his, the Count (whosedayly prayers were to the same purpose) frankly gave his Son to theNobleman: albeit naturall and fatherly affection, urged someunwillingnesse to part so with him; yet necessity and discretion,found it best for the benefit of them both. Being thus eased of carefor his Son and Daughter, and they (though in different places) yetunder good and worthy government; the Count would continue no longerin England: but, as best hee could procure the meanes, passed overinto Ireland, and being arrived at a place called Stanford, becameservant to an Earle of that Country, a Gentleman professing Armes,on whom he attended as a serving man, and lived a long while in thatestate very painfully.

　　His daughter Violenta, clouded under the borrowed name ofGianetta, dwelling with the Lady at London, grew so in yeares, beauty,comelinesse of person, and was so gracefull in the favour of herLord and Lady, yea, of every one in the house beside, that it waswonderfull to behold. Such as but observed her usuall carriage, andwhat modesty shined clearely in her eyes, reputed her well worthy ofhonourable preferment; in regard, the Lady that had received her ofher Father, not knowing of whence, or what shee was; but as himselfehad made report, intended to match her in honourable marriage,according as her vertues worthily deserved. But God, the just rewarderof all good endeavours, knowing her to be noble by birth, and(causelesse) to suffer for the sinnes of another; disposed otherwiseof her: and that so worthy a Virgin might be no mate for a man ofill conditions, no doubt ordained what was to be done, according tohis owne good pleasure.The Noble Lady, with whom poore Gianetta dwelt, had but one onelySonne by her Husband, and he most deerely affected of them both, aswell in regard he was to be their heire, as also for his vertues andcommendable qualities, wherein he excelled many young Gentlemen.Endued he was with heroycall valour, compleate in all perfections ofperson, and his minde every way answerable to his outward behaviour,exceeding Gianetta about sixe yeeres in age. Hee perceiving her tobe a faire and comely Maiden, grew to affect her so entirely, that allthings else he held contemptible, and nothing pleasing in his eyebut shee. Now, in regard her parentage was reputed poore, he kepthis love concealed from his Parents, not daring to desire her inmarriage: for loath he was to loose their favour, by disclosing thevehemency of his afflictions, which proved a greater torment to him,then if it had beene openly knowne.

　　It came to passe, that love over-awed him in such sort, as he fellinto a violent sicknesse, and store of Physicions were sent for, tosave him from death, if possibly it might be. Their judgementsobserving the course of his sicknesse, yet not reaching to the causeof the disease, made a doubtfull question of his recovery; which wasso displeasing to his parents, that their griefe and sorrow grewbeyond measure. Many earnest entreaties they moved to him, to know theoccasion of his sickenesse, whereto he returned no other answere,but heart-breaking sighes, and incessant teares, which drew him moreand more into weakenesse of body.

　　It chanced on a day, a Physicion was brought unto him, being youngin yeeres, but well experienced in his practise: and as hee madetriall of his pulse, Gianetta (who by his Mothers command, attended onhim very diligently) upon some especiall occasion entred into theChamber, which when the young Gentleman perceived, and that sheeneither spake word, nor so much as looked towards him, his heartgrew great in amorous desire, and his pulse did beate beyond thecompasse of ordinary custome; whereof the Physicion made goodobservation, to note how long that fit would continue. No sooner wasGianetta gone forth of the Chamber, but the pulse immediately gaveover beating, which perswaded the Physicion, that some part of thedisease had now discovered it selfe apparantly.

　　Within a while after, pretending to have some speech withGianetta, and holding the Gentleman still by the arme, the Physicioncaused her to be sent for; and immediately shee came. Upon her veryentrance into the Chamber, the pulse began to beate againe extreamely,and when shee departed, it presently ceased. Now was he thorowlyperswaded, that he had found the true effect of his sicknesse, whentaking the Father and mother aside, thus he spake to them. If you bedesirous of your Sons health, it consisteth not either in Physicion orphysicke, but in the mercy of your faire Maide Gianetta; formanifest signes have made it knowne to me, and he loveth theDamosell very dearely: yet (for ought I can perceive, the Maide dothnot know it:) now if you have respect of his life, you know (in thiscase) what is to be done. The Nobleman and his Wife hearing this,became somewhat satisfied, because there remained a remedy to preservehis life: but yet it was no meane griefe to them, if it should sosucceede, as they feared, namely, the marriage betweene this theirSonne and Gianetta.

　　The Physicion being gone, and they repairing to their sicke Sonne,the Mother began with him in this manner. Sonne, I was alwayesperswaded, that thou wouldest not conceale any secret from me, orthe least part of thy desires; especially, when without enjoying them,thou must remaine in the danger of death. Full well art thouassured, or in reason oughtest to be, that there is not any thingfor thy contentment, be it of what quality soever, but it shouldhave beene provided for thee, and in as ample manner as for mineowne selfe. But though thou hast wandred so farre from duty, andhazarded both thy life and ours, it commeth so to passe, that Heavenhath beene more mercifull to thee, then thou wouldest be to thy selfe,or us. And to prevent thy dying of this disease, a dreame this nighthath acquainted me with the principall occasion of thy sickenesse,to wit extraordinary affection to a young Maiden, in some such placeas thou hast seene her. I tell thee Sonne, it is a matter of nodisgrace to love, and why shouldst thou shame to manifest as much,it being so apt and convenient for thy youth? For if I were perswaded,that thou couldst not love, I should make the lesse esteeme of thee.Therefore deare Sonne, be not dismayed, but freely discover thineaffections. Expell those disastrous drouping thoughts, that haveindangered thy life by this long lingering sicknesse. And let thysoule be faithfully assured, that thou canst not require any thingto be done, remaining within the compasse of my power, but I willperforme it; for I love thee as dearely as mine owne life. Settherefore aside this nice conceit of shame and feare, revealing thetruth boldly to me, if I may stead thee in thy love; resolving thyselfe unfaignedly, that if my care stretch not to compasse thycontent, account me for the most cruell Mother living, and utterlyunworthy of such a Sonne.

　　The young Gentleman having heard these protestations made by hisMother, was not a little ashamed of his owne follie; butrecollecting his better thoughts together, and knowing in his soule,that no one could better further his hopes, then shee; forgettingall his former feare, he returned her this answere; Madam, and mydearely affected Mother, nothing hath more occasioned my loves sostrict concealement, but an especiall errour, which I finde by dailyproofe in many, who being growne to yeeres of grave discretion, doenever remember, that they themselves have bin yong. But because hereinI find you to be both discreet and wise, I will not onely affirme whatyou have seen in me to be true, but also will confesse, to whom it is:upon condition, that the effect of your promise may follow it,according to the power remaining in you, whereby you onely maysecure my life.

　　His Mother, desirous to bee resolved, whether his confession wouldagree with the Physitians words, or no, and reserving anotherintention to her selfe: bad him feare nothing, but freely discover hiswhole desire, and forthwith she doubted not to effect it. ThenMadame (quoth hee) the matchlesse beauty, and commendable qualities ofyour Maid Gianetta, to whom (as yet) I have made no motion, tocommisserate this my languishing extremity, nor acquainted anyliving creature with my love: the concealing of these afflictions tomyselfe, hath brought mee to this desperate condition: and if somemeane bee not wrought, according to your constant promise, for thefull enjoying of my longing desires, assure your selfe (most NobleMother) that the date of my life is very short. The Lady well knowing,that the time now rather required kindest comfort, then any severeor sharpe reprehension, smiling on him, said: Alas deere sonne, wastthou sicke for this? Be of good cheare, and when thy strength isbetter restored, then referre the matter to me. The young Gentleman,being put in good hope by his Mothers promise, began (in short time)to shew apparant signes of well-forwarded amendment, to the Mothersgreat joy and comfort, disposing her selfe dayly to proove, how inhonor she might keepe promise with her sonne.

　　Within a short while after, calling Gianetta privately to her, ingentle manner, and by the way of pleasant discourse, she demanded ofhir, whither she was provided of a Lover, or no. Gianetta, being neveracquainted with any such questions, a scarlet Dye covering all hermodest countenance, thus replyed. Madam, I have no neede of any Lover,and very unseemely were it, for so poore a Damosell as I am, to haveso much as a thought of Lovers, being banished from my friends andkinsfolke, and remaining in service as I do.

　　If you have none (answered the Ladie) wee will bestow one on you,which shall content your minde, and bring you to a more pleasing kindeof life; because it is farre unfit, that so faire a Maid as youare., should remaine destitute of a Lover. Madam, said Gianetta,considering with my selfe, that since you received me of my pooreFather, you have used me rather like your daughter, then a servant; itbecommeth mee to doe as pleaseth you. Notwithstanding, I trust (in theregard of mine owne good and honour) never to use any complaint insuch a case: but if you please to bestow a husband on me, I purpose tolove and honor him onely, and not any other. For, of all theinheritance left me by my progenitors, nothing remaineth to me buthonourable honesty, and that shall be my Legacie so long as I live.

　　These wordes, were of a quite contrary complexion, to those whichthe Lady expected from her, and for effecting the promise made untohir Sonne: howbeit (like a wise and noble Ladie) much she inwardlycommended the maids answers, and said unto her. But tell meGianetta, what if my Lord the King (who is a gallant youthfull Prince,and you so bright a beautie as you are) should take pleasure in yourlove, would ye denie him? Sodainly the Maide returned this answer:Madame, the King perhaps might enforce me, but with my free consent,hee shall never have any thing of me that is not honest. Nor did theLady dislike her Maides courage and resolution, but breaking of allher further conference, intended shortly to put her project in proofe,saying to her son, that when he was fully recovered, he should haveprivate accesse to Gianetta, whom shee doubted not but would betractable enough to him; for she helde it no meane blemish to herhonour, to moove the Maide any more in the matter, but let himcompasse it as he could.

　　Farre from the yong Gentlemans humour was this answer of his Mother,because he aimed not at any dishonourable end: true, faithfull, andhonest love was the sole scope of his intention, foule and loathsomelust he utterly defied; whereupon he fell into sickenesse againe,rather more violently then before. Which the Lady perceiving, revealedher whole intent to Gianetta, and finding her constancie beyond commoncomparison, acquainted her Lord with all she had done, and bothconsented (though much against their mindes) to let him enjoy her inhonourable marriage: accounting it better, for preservation of theironely sons life, to match him farre inferiour to his degree, then bydenying h desire, to let him pine and dye for her love.

　　After great consultation with Kindred and Friends, the match wasagreed upon, to the no little joy of Gianetta, who devoutly returnedinfinite thankes to heaven, for so mercifully respecting herdejected poore estate, after the bitter passage of so many miseries,and never tearming her selfe any otherwise, but the daughter of apoore Piccard. Soone was the yong Gentleman recovered and married,no man alive so well contented as he, and setting downe an absolutedetermination, to lead a loving life with his Gianetta.

　　Let us now convert our lookes to Wales, to Perotto; being leftethere with the other Lord Marshall, who was the President of thatCountrey. On hee grew in yeeres, choisely respected by his Lord,because hee was most comely of person, and forward to all valiantattempts: so that in Tourneyes, joustes, and other actions of Armes,his like was not to bee found in all the Island, being named onelyPerotto the valiant Piccard, and so was he famed farre and neere. AsGod had not forgotten his Sister, so in mercy he became as mindefullof him; for, a contagious mortalitie hapning in the Country, thegreater part of the people perished thereby, the rest flying thenceinto other partes of the Land, whereby the whole Province becamedispeopled and desolate.

　　In the time of this plague and dreadful visitation, the LordPresident, his Lady, Sonnes, Daughters, Brothers, Nephewes, andKindred dyed, none remaining alive, but one onely Daughtermarriageable, a few of the houshold servants, beside Perotto, whom(after the sickenesse was more mildly asswaged) with counsell andconsent of the Countrey people, the young Lady accepted to be herhusband, because hee was a man so worthy and valiant; and of all theinheritance left by her deceased Father, she made him Lord, and solecommander. Within no long while after, the King of Englandunderstanding that his President of Wales was dead, and Fame liberallyrelating the vertues, valour, and good parts of Perotto the Piccard,hee created him President thereof, and to supply the place of hisdeceased Lord. These faire fortunes, within the compasse of so short atime, fell to the two innocent children of the Count D'Angiers afterthey were left by him as lost and forlorne.

　　Eighteene yeeres were now fully overpast, since the CountD'Angiers fled from Paris, having suffered (in miserable sort) manyhard and lamentable adversities; and seeing himselfe now to begrowne aged, hee was desirous to leave Ireland, and to know (if heemight) what was become of both his Children. Heereupon, perceiving hiswonted forme to be so altered, that such as formerly had conversedmost with him, could now not take any knowledge of him, and feelinghis body (through long labour and exercise endured in service) morelustie then in his idle youthfull yeeres, especially when he leftthe Court of France, hee purposed to proceede in his determination.Being verie poore and simple in apparrel, he departed from the IrishEarle his Master, with whom he had continued long in service, to noadvantage or advancement, and crossing over into England, travayled tothe place in Wales, where he left Perotto, and where he found him tobe Lord Marshall and President of the country, lusty and in goodhealth, a man of goodly feature, and most honorably respected andreverenced of the people.

　　Well may you imagine, that this was no small comfort to the pooreaged Countes heart, yet would he not make himselfe knowne to him, orany other about him, but referred his joy to a further enlarging anddiminishing, by sight of the other limbe of his life, his deerelyaffected daughter Gianetta, denying rest to his bodie in any place,until such time as he came to London. Making there secret enquiryconcerning the Ladie with whom hee had left his daughter; heeunderstoode, that a young Gentlewoman, named Gianetta, was marriedto that Ladies onely Son, which made a second addition of joy to hissoule, accounting all his passed adversities of no valew, both hischildren being living, and in so high honour.

　　Having found her dwelling, and (like a kinde Father) being earnestlydesirous to see her; he dayly resorted nere to the house, where SirRoger Mandevile (for so was Gianettaes husband named) chauncing to seehim, being moved to compassion, because he was both poore and aged:commaunded one of his men, to take him into the house, and to give himsome foode for Gods sake, which (accordingly) the servant performed.Gianetta had divers children by her husband, the eldest being buteight yeeres of age, yet all of them so faire and comely as couldbe. As the old Count sate eating his meate in the Hall, the childrencame all about him, embracing, hugging, and making much of him, evenas if Nature had truly instructed them, that this was their aged(though poor) Grandfather, and hee as lovingly receiving these kilderelations from them, wisely and silently kept all to himselfe, withsighes, teares, and joyes intermixed together. Insomuch that thechildren would not part from him though their Tutor and Mastercalled them often, which being tolde to their Mother, shee came foorthof the neere adjoyning Parlour, and threatned to beate them, if theywould not doe what their Maister commanded them.

　　Then the Children began to cry, saying; that they would tarriestil by the good olde man, because he loved them better then theirMaster did; whereat both the Lady and the Count began to smile. TheCount, a poore Begger, and not as Father to so great a Lady, arose,and did her humble reverence, because she was now a Noble Woman,conceyving wonderfull joy in his soule, to see her so faire and goodlya creature: yet could she take no knowledge of him, Age, want, andmisery had so mightily altered him; his head all white, his beardwithout any comly forme, his Garments so poore, and his face sowrinkled, leane and meager, that he seemed rather some Carter, thena Count. And Gianetta perceiving that when her Children were fetchtaway, they returned againe to the olde man, and would not leave him,she desired their Maister to let them alone.While thus the Children continued making much of the good olde man,Lord Andrew Mandevile, Father to Sir Roger, came into the Hall, asbeing so willed to doe by the Childrens Schoolemaster. He being ahastie-minded man, and one that ever-despised Gianetta before, butmuch more since her marriage to his sonne, angerly said; Let themalone with a mischeefe, and so befall them, their best company oughtto bee with beggers, for so they are bred and borne by the Mothersside: and therefore it is no mervaile, if like will to like, a beggersbrats to keepe company with beggers. The Count hearing thesecontemptible wordes, was not a little greeved thereat; and althoughhis courage was greater then his poore condition would permit him toexpresse; yet, clouding all injuries with noble patience, hangingdowne his head, and shedding many a salt teare, endured this reproach,as hee had done many, both before and after.

　　But honourable Sir Roger, perceiving what delight his Children tookein the poore mans company; albeit he was offended at his Fathers harshwords, by holding his wife in such base respect: yet favoured thepoore Count so much the more, and seeing him weepe, did greatlycompassionate his case, saying to the poore man, that if he wouldaccept of his service, he willingly would entertaine him. Wheretothe Count replyed, that very gladly he would embrace his kindeoffer: but he was capeable of no other service, save onely to be anhorsekeeper, wherein he had imployed the most part of his time.Heereupon, more for pleasure and pitty then any necessity of hisservice, he was appointed to the keeping of an Horse, which wasonely for his Daughters saddle, and daily after he had done hisdiligence about the Horse, he did nothing else but play with thechildren. While Fortune pleased thus to dally with the poore CountD'Angiers, and his children, it came to passe, that the King of France(after divers leagues of truces passed betweene him and the Germaines)died, and next after him, his Son the Dolphin was crowned King, and itwas his wife that wrongfully caused the Counts banishment. Afterexpiration of the last league with the Germains, the warres began togrow much more fierce and sharpe, and the King of England, (uponrequest made to him by his new brother of France) sent him veryhonourable supplies of his people, under the conduct of Perotto, hislately elected President of Wales, and Sir Roger Mandevile, Son to hisother Lord high Marshall; with whom also the poore Count went, andcontinued a long while in the Campe as a common Souldier, where yetlike a valiant Gentleman (as indeed he was no lesse) both in adviceand actions; he accomplished many more notable matters, then wasexpected to come from him.

　　It so fell out, that in the continuance of this warre, the Queene ofFrance fell into a grievous sicknesse, and perceiving her selfe tobe at the point of death, shee became very penitently sorrowfull forall her sinnes, earnestly desiring that shee might be confessed by theArchbishop of Roane, who was reputed to be an holy and vercuous man.In the repetition of her other offences; she revealed what great wrongshe had done to the Count D'Angiers, resting not so satisfied, withdisclosing the whole matter to him alone; but also confessed thesame before many other worthy persons, and of great honour, entreatingthem to worke so with the King, that (if the Count were yet living, orany of his Children) they might be restored to their former honouragaine.

　　It was not long after, but the Queene left this life, and was mostroyally enterred, when her confession being disclosed to the King,after much sorrow for so injuriously wronging a man of so great valourand honour: Proclamation was made throughout the Campe, and in manyother parts of France beside, that whosoever could produce the CountD'Angiers, or any of his Children, should richly be rewarded foreach one of them; in regard he was innocent of the foule imputation,by the Queenes owne confession, and for his wrongfull exile so long,he should be exalted to his former honour with farre greaterfavours, which the King franckely would bestow upon him. When theCount (who walked up and downe in the habite of a common servitor)heard this Proclamation, forth-with hee went to his Master Sir RogerMandevile, requesting his speedy repaire to Lord Perotto, that beingboth assembled together, he would acquaint them with a serious matter,concerning the late Proclamation published by the King. Being bythemselves alone in the Tent, the Count spake in this manner toPerotto. Sir, S. Roger Mandevile here, your equall competitor inthis military service, is the husband to your naturall sister,having as yet never received any dowry with her, but her inherentunblemishable vertue and honor. Now because she may not stil remaindestitute of a competent Dowry: I desire that Sir Roger, and noneother, may enjoy the royall reward promised by the King. You LordPerotto, whose true name is Lewes, manifest your selfe to be noblyborne, and Sonne to the wrongfull banished Count D'Angiers: avouchmoreover, that Violenta, shadowed under the borrowed name of Gianetta,is your owne Sister; and deliver me up as your Father, the long exiledCount D'Angiers. Perotto hearing this, beheld him more advisedly,and began to know him: then, the tears flowing abundantly from hiseyes, he fell at his feete, and often embracing him, saide: My deereand noble Father! a thousand times more deerely welcome to yourSonne Lewes.

　　Sir Roger Mandevile, hearing first what the Count had saide, andseeing what Perotto afterward performed; became surprized with suchextraordinary joy and admiration, that he knew not how to carryhimselfe in this case. Neverthelesse, giving credite to his words, andbeing somewhat ashamed, that he had not used the Count in morerespective manner, and remembring beside, the unkinde language ofhis furious Father to him: he kneeled downe, humbly craving pardon,both for his Fathers rudenes and his owne, which was courteouslygranted by the Count, embracing him lovingly in his armes.

　　When they had a while discoursed their severall fortunes, sometimein teares, and then againe in joy; Perotto and Sir Roger, would havethe Count to be garmented in better manner, but in no wise he wouldsuffer it; for it was his onely desire, that Sir Roger should beeassured of the promised reward, by presenting him in the Kingspresence, and in the homely habit which he did weare, to touch himwith the more sensible shame, for his rash beleefe, and injuriousproceeding. Then Sir Roger Mandevile, guiding the Count by the hand,and Perotto following after, came before the King, offering to presentthe Count and his children, if the reward promised in the Proclamationmight be performed. The King immediately commanded, that a reward ofinestimable valew should be produced; desiring Sir Roger upon thesight thereof, to make good his offer, for forthwith presenting theCount and his children. Which hee made no longer delay of, but turninghimselfe about, delivered the aged Count, by the title of his servant,and presenting Perotto next, saide. Sir, heere I deliver you theFather and his Son, his Daughter who is my wife, cannot soconveniently be here now, but shortly, by the permission of heaven,your Majesty shall have a sight of her.

　　When the King heard this, stedfastly he looked on the Count; and,notwithstanding his wonderfull alteration, both from his wontedfeature and forme: yet, after he had very seriously viewed him, heknew him perfectly; and the teares trickling downe his cheekespartly with remorsefull shame, and joy also for his so happy recovery,he tooke up the Count from kneeling, kissing, and embracing him verykindely, welcomming Perotto in the selfe same manner. Immediately alsohe gave commaund, that the Count should be restored to his honors,apparell, servants, horses, and furniture, answerable to his highestate and calling, which was as speedily performed. Moreover, the Kingreatly honoured Sir Roger Mandevile, desiring to be made acquaintedwith all their passed fortunes.

　　When Sir Roger had received the royall reward, for thus surrenderingthe Count and his Sonne, the Count calling him to him, saide. Takethat Princely remuneration of my soveraigne Lord and King, andcommending me to your unkinde Father, tell him that your Childrenare no beggars brats, neither basely borne by their Mothers side.Sir Roger returning home with his bountifull reward, soone afterbrought his Wife and Mother to Paris, and so did Perotto his Wifewhere in great joy and triumph, they continued with while with thenoble Count; who had all his goods and honours restored to him, infarre greater measure then ever they were before: his Sonnes in Lawreturning home with their Wives into England, left the Count withthe King at Paris, where he spent the rest of his dayes in greathonour and felicity.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THAT BY OVERLIBERALL COMMENDING THE

　　CHASTITY OF WOMEN, IT FALLETH OUT (OFTENTIMES) TO BE VERY

　　DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY BY THE MEANES OF TREACHERERS WHO YET

　　(IN THE ENDE) ARE JUSTLY PUNNISHED FOR THEIR TREACHERY

　　Bernardo, a Merchant of Geneway, being deceived by another Merchant,named Ambroginolo, lost a great part of his goods. And commandinghis innocent Wife to be murthered, she escaped, and (in the habiteof a man) became servant to the Soldane. The deceiver being found atlast, shee compassed such meanes, that her Husband Bernardo cameinto Alexandria, and there, after due punnishment inflicted on thefalse deceiver, she resumed the garments againe of a woman, andreturned home with her Husband to Geneway.

　　Madam Eliza having ended her compassionate discourse, which indeedehad moved all the rest to sighing; the Queene, who was faire, comelyof stature, and tarrying a very majesticall countenance, smilingmore familarly then the other, spake to them thus. It is verynecessary, that the promise made to Dioneus, should carefully be kept,and because now there remaineth none, to report any more Novels, butonely he and my selfe: I must first deliver mine, and he (who takes itfor an honour) to be the last in relating his owne, last let him befor his owne deliverance. Then pausing a little while, thus shebegan againe. Many times among vulgar people, it hath passed as acommon Proverbe: That the deceiver is often trampled on, by such as hehath deceived. And this cannot shew it selfe (by any reason) to betrue, except such accidents as awaite on treachery, doe really makea just discovery thereof. And therefore according to the course ofthis day observed, I am the woman that must make good what I havesaide for the approbation of that Proverbe: no way (I hope)distastfull to you in the hearing, but advantageable to preserve youfrom any such beguiling.

　　There was a faire and goodly Inne in Paris, much frequented bymany great Italian Merchants, according to such variety of occasionsand businesse, as urged their often resorting thither. One night amongmany other, having had a merry Supper together, they began todiscourse on divers matters, and falling from one relation to another;they communed in very friendly manner, concerning their wives, lefteat home in their houses. Quoth the first, I cannot well imagine whatmy wife is now doing, but I am able to say for my selfe, that if apretty female should fall into my company: I could easily forget mylove to my wife, and make use of such an advantage offered.

　　A second replyed; And trust me, I should do no lesse, because I amperswaded, that if my wife be willing to wander, the law is in herowne hand, and I am farre enough from home: dumbe walles blab notales, and offences unknowne are sildome or never called inquestion. A third man unapt in censure, with his former fellowes ofthe Jury; and it plainely appeared, that all the rest were of the sameopinion, condemning their wives over-rashly, and alledging, thatwhen husbands strayed so far from home, their wives had wit enoughto make use of their time.

　　Onely one man among them all, named Bernardo Lomellino, and dwellingin Geneway, maintained the contrary; boldly avouching, that by theespeciall favour of Fortune, he had a wife so perfectly compleate inall graces and vertues, as any Lady in the world possibly could be,and that Italy scarsely contained her equall. But, she was goodly ofperson, and yet very young, quicke, quaint, milde, and courteous,and not any thing appertaining to the office of a wife, either fordomesticke affayres, or any other imployment whatsoever, but inwomanhoode shee went beyond all other. No Lord, Knight, Esquire, orGentleman, could bee better served at his Table, then himselfe daylywas, with more wisedome, modesty and discretion. After all this, heepraised her for riding, hawking, hunting, fishing, fowling, reading,writing, enditing, and most absolute keeping his Bookes of accounts,that neither himselfe, or any other Merchant could therein excell her.After infinite other commendations, he came to the former point oftheir argument, concerning the easie falling of women intowantonnesse, maintaining (with a solemne oath) that no womanpossibly could be more chaste and honest then she: in which respect,he was verily perswaded, that if he stayed from her ten years space(yea all his life time) out of his house; yet never would sheefalsifie her faith to him, or be lewdly allured by any other man.

　　Amongst these Merchants thus communing together, there was a youngproper man, named Ambroginolo of Placentia, who began to laugh atthe last prayses which Bernardo had used of his Wife, and seeming tomake a mockerie thereof, demaunded, if the Emperour had given him thispriviledge, above all other married men? Bernardo being somewhatoffended, answered: No Emperour hath done it, but the especiallblessing of heaven, exceeding all the Emperours on the earth in grace,and thereby have received this favour; whereto Ambroginolo presentlythus replyed. Bernardo, without all question to the contrary, Ibeleeve that what thou hast said, is true; but (for ought I canperceive) thou hast slender judgement in the Nature of things:because, if thou diddst observe them well, thou couldst not be of sogrosse understanding. For, by comprehending matters in their truekinde and nature, thou wouldst speake of them more correctly then thoudoest. And to the end, thou mayest not imagine, that we who havespoken of our Wives, doe thinke any otherwise of them, then as welland honestly as thou canst of thine, nor that any thing else didurge these speeches of them, or falling into this kinde ofdiscourse, but onely by a naturall instinct and admonition, I wilproceede familiarly, a little further with thee, uppon the matteralreadie propounded. I have evermore understoode, that man was themost noble creature, formed by God to live in this World, and woman inthe next degree to him: but man, as generally is beleeved, and as isdiscerned by apparant effects is the most perfect of both. Having thenthe most perfection in him, without all doubt, he must be so muchthe more firme and constant. So in like manner, it hath beene, andis universally graunted, that Woman is more various and mutable, maybe approved by and the reason thereof may be approved by many naturallcircumstances, which were needlesse now to make any mention of. If aman then be possessed of the greater stability, and yet cannotcontaine himselfe from condiscending, I say not to one thatentreates him, but to desire any other that please him; and beside, tocovet the enjoying of his owne pleasing contentment (a thing notchancing to him once in a moneth, but infinite times in a dayesspace). What can you then conceive of a fraile Woman, subject (bynature) to entreaties, flatteries, giftes, perswasions, and a thousandother inticing meanes, which a man (that is affected to her) canuse? Doest thou thinke then that she hath any power to containe?Assuredly, though thou shouldest rest so resolved, yet cannot I beof the same opinion. For I am sure thou beleevest, and must needesconfesse it, that thy wife is a Woman, made of flesh and blood, asother women are: if it be so, she cannot bee without the same desires,and the weaknesse or strength as other women have, to resistnaturall appetites as her owne are. In regard whereof, it is meerelyimpossible (although she be most honest) but she must needs doe thatwhich other Women doe: for there is nothing else possible, either tobe denied or affirmed to the contrary, as thou most unadvisedly hastdone.

　　Bernardo answered in this manner. I am a Merchant, and noPhilosopher, and like a Merchant I meane to answer thee. I am not tolearne, that these accidents by thee related, may happen to fooles,who are voide of understanding or shame: but such as are wise, andendued with vertue, have alwayes such a precious esteeme of theirhonour, that they wil containe those principles of constancie, whichmen are meerely carelesse of, and I justifie my wife to be one ofthem. Beleeve me Bernardo, replyed Ambroginolo, if so often as thywives minde is addicted to wanton folly, a badge of scorne shouldarise on thy forehead, to render testimony of hir female frailty, Ibeleeve the number of them would be more, then willingly you wouldwish them to be. And among all married men in every degree, thenotes are so secret of their wives imperfections, that the sharpestsight is not able to discerne them: and the wiser sort of men arewilling not to know them; because shame and losse of honour is neverimposed, but in cases evident and apparant.

　　Perswade thy selfe then Bernardo, that what women may accomplishin secret, they will rarely faile to doe: or if they abstaine, it isthrough feare and folly. Wherefore, hold it for a certaine rule,that that is onely chaste, that never was solicited personally, orif she endured any such suite, either shee answered yea, or no. Andalbeit I know this to be true, by many infallible and naturallreasons, yet could I not speak so exactly as I doe, if I had not triedexperimentally, the humours and affections of divers Women. Yea, andlet me tell thee more Bernardo, were I in private company with thywife, howsoever thou presumest to thinke her to be, I should accountit a matter of no impossibility, to finde in her the selfesamefrailty.

　　Bernardoes blood now began to boyle, and patience being a little putdowne by choller, thus he replyed. A combat of words requiresover-long continuance; for I maintaine the matter which thoudeniest, and all this sorts to nothing in the end. But seeing thoupresumest, that all women are so apt and tractable, and thy selfe soconfident of thine owne power: I willingly yeeld (for the betterassurance of my wifes constant loyalty) to have my head smitten off,if thou canst winne her to any such dishonest act, by any meaneswhatsoever thou canst use unto her; which if thou canst not doe,thou shalt onely loose a thousand duckets of Gold. Now beganAmbroginolo to be heated with these words, answering thus. Bernardo,if I had won the wager, I know not what I should doe with thy head;but if thou be willing to stand upon the proofe, pawne downe fivethousand Duckets of gold, (a matter of much lesse value then thy head)against a thousand Duckets of mine, granting me a lawfull limitedtime, which I require to be no more then the space of three moneths,after the day of my departing hence. I will stand bound to goe forGeneway, and there winne such kinde consent of thy Wife, as shall beto mine owne content. In witnesse whereof, I will bring backe withme such private and especiall tokens, as thou thy selfe shalt confessethat I have not failed. Provided, that thou doe first promise upon thyfaith, to absent thy selfe thence during my limitted time, and be nohinderance to me by thy Letters, concerning the attempt by meundertaken.

　　Bernardo saide, Be it a bargaine, am the man that will make goodmy five thousand Duckets; and albeit the other Merchants then present,earnestly laboured to breake the wager, knowing great harme must needsensue thereon: yet both the parties were so hot and fiery, as allthe other men spake to no effect, but writings was made, sealed, anddelivered under either of their hands, Bernardo remaining at Paris,and Ambroginolo departing for Geneway. There he remained some fewdayes, to learne the streetes name where Bernardo dwelt, as also theconditions and qualities of his Wife, which scarcely pleased himwhen he heard them; because they were farre beyond her Husbandsrelation, and shee reputed to be the onely wonder of women; whereby heplainely perceived, that he had undertaken a very idle enterprise, yetwould he not give it over so, but proceeded therein a little further.

　　He wrought such meanes, that he came acquainted with a poorewoman, who often frequented Bernardoes house, and was greatly infavour with his wife; upon whose poverty he so prevailed, by earnestperswasions, but much more by large gifts of money, that he won her tofurther him in this manner following. A faire and artificiall Chest hecaused to be purposely made, wherein himselfe might be aptlycontained, and so conveyed into the House of Bernardoes Wife, undercolour of a formall excuse; that the poore woman should be absent fromthe City two or three dayes, and shee must keepe it safe till shereturne. The Gentlewoman suspecting no guile, but that the Chest wasthe receptacle of all the womans wealth; would trust it in no otherroome, then her owne Bed-chamber, which was the place whereAmbroginolo most desired to bee.

　　Being thus conveyed into the Chamber, the night going on apace,and the Gentlewoman fast asleepe in her bed, a lighted Taper stoodburning on the Table by her, as in her Husbands absence shee ever usedto have: Ambroginolo softly opened the Chest, according as cunninglyhee had contrived it, and stepping forth in his sockes made of cloath,observed the scituation of the Chamber, the paintings, pictures, andbeautifull hangings, with all things else that were remarkable,which perfectly he committed to his memory. Going neere to the bed, hesaw her lie there sweetly sleeping, and her young Daughter in likemanner by her, she seeming then as compleate and pleasing acreature, as when shee was attired in her best bravery. No especiallnote or marke could hee descrie, whereof he might make crediblereport, but onely a small wart upon her left pappe, with some fewhaires growing thereon, appearing to be as yellow as gold.

　　Sufficient had he seene, and durst presume no further; but takingone of her Rings, which lay upon the Table, a purse of hers, hangingby on the wall, a light wearing Robe of silke, and her girdle, allwhich he put into the Chest; and being in himselfe, closed it fastas it was before, so continuing there in the Chamber two severallnights, the Gentlewoman neither mistrusting or missing any thing.The third day being come, the poore woman, according as formerly wasconcluded, came to have home her Chest againe, and brought it safelyinto her owne house; where Ambroginolo comming forth of it,satisfied the poore woman to her owne liking, returning (with allthe forenamed things) so fast as conveniently he could to Paris.

　　Being arrived there long before his limmitted time, he called theMerchants together, who were present at the passed words and wager;avouching before Bernardo, that he had won his five thousandDuckets, and performed the taske he undertooke. To make good hisprotestation, first he described the forme of the Chamber, the curiouspictures hanging about it, in what manner the bed stood, and everycircumstance else beside. Next he shewed the severall things, which hebrought away thence with him, affirming that he had received them ofher selfe. Bernardo confessed, that his description of the Chamber wastrue, and acknowledged moreover, that these other things did belong tohis Wife: But (quoth he) this may be gotten, by corrupting someservant of mine, both for intelligence of the Chamber, as also ofthe Ring, Purse, and what else is beside; all which suffice not to winthe wager, without some other more apparant and pregnant token. Introth, answered Ambroginolo, me thinkes these should serve forsufficient proofes; but seeing thou art so desirous to know more: Iplainely tell thee, that faire Genevra thy Wife, hath a small roundwart upon her left pappe, and some few little golden haires growingthereon.

　　When Bernardo heard these words, they were as so many stabs to hisheart, yea, beyond all compasse of patient sufferance, and by thechanging of his colour, it was noted manifestly, (being unable toutter one word) that Ambroginolo had spoken nothing but the truth.Within a while after, he saide; Gentlemen, that which Ambroginolo hathsaide, is very true, wherefore let him come when he will, and he shallbe paide; which accordingly he performed on the very next day, even tothe utmost penny, departing then from Paris towards Geneway, with amost malitious intention to his Wife: Being come neere to the City, hewould not enter it, but rode to a Country house of his, standing abouttenne miles distant thence. Being there arrived, he called aservant, in whom hee reposed especiall trust, sending him to Genewaywith two Horses, writing to his Wife, that he was returned, and sheeshould come thither to see him. But secretly he charged his servant,that so soone as he had brought her to a convenient place, he shouldthere kill her, without any pitty or compassion, and then returne tohim againe.

　　When the servant was come to Geneway, and had delivered his Letterand message, Genevra gave him most joyfull welcome, and on themorrow morning mounting on Horse-backe with the servant, rodemerrily towards the Country house; divers things shee discoursed on bythe way, till they descended into a deepe solitary valey, very thicklybeset with high and huge spreading Trees, which the servant supposedto be a meete place, for the execution of his Masters command.Suddenly drawing forth his Sword, and holding Genevra fast by thearme, he saide; Mistresse, quickly commend your soule to God, foryou must die, before you passe any further. Genevra seeing the nakedSword, and hearing the words so peremptorily delivered, fearefullyanswered; Alas deare friend, mercy for Gods sake; and before thou killme, tell me wherein I have offended thee, and why thou must kill me?Alas good Mistresse replied the servant, you have not any way offendedme, but in what occasion you have displeased your Husband, it isutterly unknowne to me: for he hath strictly commanded me, withoutrespect of pitty or compassion, to kill you by the way as I bring you,and if I doe it not, he hath sworne to hang me by the necke. Youknow good Mistresse, how much I stand obliged to him, and howimpossible it is for me, to contradict any thing that he commandeth.God is my witnesse, that I am truly compassionate of you, and yet(by no meanes) may I let you live.

　　Genevra kneeling before him weeping, wringing her hands, thusreplyed. Wilt thou turne Monster, and be a murtherer of her that neverwronged thee, to please another man, and on a bare command? God, whotruly knoweth all things, is my faithfull witnesse, that I nevercommitted any offence, whereby to deserve the dislike of my Husband,much lesse so harsh a recompence as this is. But flying from mine ownejustification, and appealing to thy manly mercy, thou mayest (wertthou but so well pleased) in a moment satisfie both thy Master and me,in such manner as I will make plaine and apparant to thee. Take thoumy garments, spare me onely thy doublet, and such a Bonnet as isfitting for a man, so returne with my habite to thy Master, assuringhim, that the deede is done. And here I sweare to thee, by that lifewhich I enjoy but by thy mercy, I will so strangely disguise my selfe,and wander so far off from these Countries, as neither he or thou, norany person belonging to these parts, shall ever heare any tydings ofme.

　　The servant, who had no great good will to kill her, very easilygrew pittifull, tooke off her upper garments, and gave her a pooreragged doublet, a sillie Chapperone, and such small store of moneyas he had, desiring her to forsake that Country, and so left her towalke on foote out of the valley. When he came to his Maister, and haddelivered him her garments, he assured him, that he had not onelyaccomplished his commaund, but also was most secure from anydiscovery: because he had no sooner done the deede, but foure orfive very ravenous Woolves, came presently running to the deadbodie, and gave it buriall in their bellyes. Bernardo soone afterreturning to Geneway, was much blamed for such unkinde cruelty tohis wife; but his constant avouching of her treason to him(according then to the Countries custome) did cleare him from allpursuite of Law.

　　Poor Genevra was left thus alone and disconsolate, and nightstealing fast upon her, shee went to a silly village neereadjoyning, where (by the meanes of a good olde woman) she got suchprovision as the place afforded, making the doublet fit to her body,and converting her petticoate to a paire of breeches, according to theMariners fashion: then cutting her haire, and quaintly disguisedlike unto a Saylor, she went to the Sea coast. By good fortune, shemet there with a Gentleman of Cathalogna, whose name was SigniorEnchararcho, who came on land from his Ship, which lay hulling thereabout Albagia, to refresh himselfe at a pleasant Spring. Enchararchotaking her to be a man, as shee appeared no otherwise by her habite;upon some conference passing betweene them, shee was entertaynedinto his service, and being brought aboord the Ship, she went underthe name of Sicurano da Finale. There shee had better apparrellbestowne on her by the Gentleman, and her service proved so pleasingand acceptable to him, that hee liked her care and diligence beyondall comparison.

　　It came to passe within a short while after, that this Gentlemanof Cathalogna sayled (with some charge of his) into Alexandria,carrying thither certaine Faulcons, which he presented to theSoldan, who oftentimes welcommed this Gentleman to his table, where heobserved the behaviour of Sicurano, attending on his MaistersTrencher, and therewith was so highly pleased; that hee requested tohave him from the Gentleman, who (for his more advancement)willingly parted with his so lately entertained servant. Sicuranowas so ready and discreet in his daily services, that he grew in asgreat grace with the Soldan, as before hee had done with Enchararcho.

　　At a certaine season in the yeare, as customary order (thereobserved) had formerly beene, in the City of Acres which was under theSoldanes subjection, there yeerely met a great assembly ofMerchants, as Christians, Moores, jewes, Sarazens, and many otherNations besides, as at a common Mart or Fayre. And to the end, thatthe Merchants (for the better sale of their goods) might be there inthe safer assurance, the Soldane used to send thither some of hisordinarie Officers, and a strong guard of Souldiers beside, todefend them from all injuries and molestation, because he reapedthereby no meane benefit. And who should be now sent about thisbusinesse, but his new elected favourite Sicurano, because she wasskilfull and. perfect in the Languages.

　　Sicurano being come to Acres, as Lord and Captaine of the Guardfor the Merchants, and for the safety of their Merchandizes, shedischarged her office most commendably, walking with her trainethorough every part of the Fayre, where she observed a worthycompany of Merchants, Sicilians, Pisans, Genewayes, Venetians, andother Italians, whom the more willingly she noted, in remembrance ofher native Country. At one especiall time among other, chancing into aShop or Booth belonging to the Venetians, she espied (hanging upwith other costly wares) a Purse and a Girdle, which sodainly sheremembred to be sometime her owne; whereat she was not a littleabashed in her minde. But without making any such outward shew,courteously she requested to know whose they were, and whether theyshould be sold, or no.

　　Ambroginolo of Placentia, was likewise come thither, and great storeof Merchandizes hee had brought with him, in a Carracke appertainingto the Venetians, and hee hearing the Captaine of the Guard demaundwhose they were, stepped foorth before him, and smiling, answered:That they were his, but not to be solde; yet if hee liked them, gladlyhe would bestow them on him. Sicurano seeing him smile, suspectedleast himselfe had (by some unfitting behaviour) beene the occasionthereof: and therefore, with a more setled countenance, hee said:Perhaps thou smilest, because I that am a man, professing Armes,should question after such womanish toyes. Ambroginolo replyed, MyLord, pardon mee, I smile not at you, or at your demaund, but at themanner how I came by these things.

　　Sicurano, upon this answere, was ten times more desirous thenbefore, and saide: If Fortune favoured thee in friendly maner, bythe obtaining of these things: if it may be spoken, tell mee howthou hadst them. My Lord (answered Ambroginolo) these things (withmany more besides) were given me by a Gentlewoman of Geneway, namedMadam Genevra, the wife to one Bernardo Lomellino, in recompence ofone nights lodging with her, and she desired me to keepe them forher sake. Now, the maine reason of my smiling, was the remembranceof her husbands folly, in waging five thousand Duckets of Gold,against one thousand of mine, that I should not obtaine my will of hisWife; which I did, and thereby won the wager. But hee, who betterdeserved to be punished for his folly, then shee, who was but sicke ofall womens disease; returning from Paris to Geneway, caused her tobe slaine, as afterward it was reported by himselfe.

　　When Sicurano heard this horrible lye, immediately shee conceived,that this was the occasion of her husbands hatred to her, and allthe hard haps which she had since suffered: whereupon, shee reputed itfor more then a mortall sinne, if such a villaine should passe withoutdue punishment. Sicurano seemed to like well this report, and grewinto such familiarity with Ambroginolo, that (by her perswasions) whenthe Fayre was ended, she tooke him higher with her into Alexandria,and all his Wares along with him, furnishing him with a fit andconvenient shop, where he made great benefite of his Merchandizes,trusting all his monies in the Captaines custody, because it was thesafest course for him, and so hee continued there with no meanecontentment.

　　Much did shee pitty her Husbands perplexity, devising by what goodand warrantable meanes she might make knowne her innocency to him;wherein her place and authority did greatly sted her, and shewrought with divers gallant Merchants of Geneway that then remained inAlexandria, and by vertue of the Soldans friendly letters beside, tobring him thither upon an lall occasion. Come he did, albeit inespeciall in poore and meane order, which soone was better alteredby her appointment, and he verie honourably (though in private)entertained by divers of her woorthie friends, till time did favourwhat she further intended.

　　In the expectation of Bernardoes arrivall, shee had so prevayledwith Ambrogiriolo, that the same tale which he formerly told to her,he delivered againe in presence of the Soldan, who seemed to be welpleased with it. But after shee had once seene her Husband, sheethought upon her more serious businesse; providing her selfe of an aptopportunity, when shee entreated such favour of the Soldan, thatboth the men might bee brought before him; where if Ambroginolowould not confesse (without constraint) that which he had made hisvaunt of concerning Bernardoes wife, he might be compelled theretoperforce.Sicuranoes word was a Law with the Soldane, so that Ambroginolo andBernardo being brought face to face, the Soldane with a sterne andangry countenance, in the presence of a most Princely Assembly,commanded Ambroginolo to declare the truth, upon perill of his life,by what meanes he won the Wager of the five thousand Golden Duckets hereceived of Bernardo. Ambroginolo seeing Sicurano there present,upon whose favour he wholly relyed, yet perceiving her lookes likewiseto be as dreadful as the Soldans, and hearing her threaten him withmost greevous torments except he revealed the truth indeed; you mayeasily guesse in what condition he stood at that instant.

　　Frownes and fury he beheld on either side, and Bernardo standingbefore him, with a world of famous witnesses, to heare his lyeconfounded by his owne confession, and his tongue to denie what it hadbefore so constantly avouched. Yet dreaming on no other pain orpenalty, but restoring backe the five thousand Duckets of gold, andthe other things by him purloyned, truly he revealed the whole formeof his falshood. Then Sicurano according as the Soldane had formerlycommanded him, turning to Bernardo, saide. And thou, upon thesuggestion of this foule lye, what didst thou to thy Wife? Being(quoth Bernardo) overcome with for the losse of my money, and thedishonor I supposed to receive by my Wife; I caused a servant ofmine to kill her, and as hee credibly avouched, her body wasdevoured by ravenous Wolves in a moment after.

　　These things being thus spoken and heard, in the presence of theSoldan, and no reason (as yet) made knowne, why the case was soseriously urged, and to what end it would succeede: Sicurano spakein this manner to the Soldane. My gracious Lord, you may plainlyperceive, in what degree that poore Gentlewoman might make hervaunt, beeing so well provided, both of a loving friend, and ahusband. Such was the friends love, that in an instant, and by awicked lye, hee robbed her both of her renowne and honour, andbereft her also of her husband. And her husband, rather creditinganothers falshoode, then the invincible trueth, whereof he hadfaithfull knowledge, by long and very honorable experience; caused herto be slaine, and made foode for devouring Wolves. Beside all this,such was the good will and affection borne to that Woman both byfriend and husband, that the longest continuer of them in her company,makes them alike in knowledge of her. But because your great wisedomknoweth perfectly what each of them have worthily deserved: if youplease (in your ever-knowne gracious benignity) to permit thepunishment of the deceiver, and pardon the partie so diceyved; Iwill procure such meanes, that she shall appeare here in yourpresence, and theirs.

　　The Soldane, being desirous to give Sicurano all manner ofsatisfaction, having followed the course so indistriously, bad himto produce the Woman, and hee was well contented. Whereat Bernardostoode much amazed, because he verity beleeved that she was dead.And Ambroginolo foreseeing already a preparation for punishment,feared, that the repayment of the money would not now serve his turne:not knowing also, what he should further hope or suspect, if the womanher selfe did personally appeare, which hee imagined would be amiracle. Sicurano having thus obtained the Soldanes permission,teares, humbling her selfe at his feete, in a moment she lost hermanly voyce and demeanour, as knowing that she was now no longer touse them, but must truly witnesse what she was indeed, and thereforethus spake.

　　Great Soldane, I am the miserable and unfortunate Genevra, thatfor the space of sixe whole yeeres, have wandered through the world,in the habite of a man, falsely and most maliciously slaundered, bythis villainous Traytor Ambroginolo, and by this unkinde cruellhusband, betraied to his servant to be slaine, and left to be devouredby savage beasts. Afterward, desiring such garments as better fittedfor her, and shewing her breasts, she made it apparant before theSoldane and his assistants, that shee was the very same woman indeede.Then turning her selfe to Ambroginolo, with more then manly courage,she demanded of him, when, and where it was, that he lay with her,as (villainously) he was not ashamed to make his vaunt? But hee,having alreadie acknowledged the contrarie, being stricken dumbewith shamefull disgrace, was not able to utter one word.

　　The Soldane, who had alwayes reputed Sicurano to be a man, havingheard and seene so admirable an accident; was so amazed in hisminde, that many times he was very doubtfull, whether this was adreame, or an absolute relation of trueth. But, after hee had moreseriously considered thereon, and found it to be reall and infallible:with extraordinary gracious praises, he commended the life, constancy,condition and vertues of Genevra, whom (til that time) he hadalwayes called Sicurano. So committing her to the company ofhonourable Ladies, to be changed from her manly habite; he pardonedBernardo her husband (according to her request formerly made) althoughhee had more justly deserved death: which likewise himselfe confessed,and falling at the feet of Genevra, desired her (in teares) to forgivehis rash transgression, which most lovingly she did, kissing andembracing him a thousand times.

　　Then the Soldane strictly commaunded, that on some high andeminent place of the Citie, Ambroginolo should be bound and impaled ona stake, having his naked body nointed all over with hony, and neverto bee taken off, untill (of it selfe) it fell in peeces, which,according to the sentence, was presently performed. Next, he gaveexpresse charge, that all his mony and goods should be given toGenevra, which valued above ten thousand double Duckets. Forthwith asolemne Feast was prepared, wherein much honor was done to Bernardo,being the husband of Genevra: and to her, as to a most worthy woman,and matchlesse wife, he gave in costly jewels, as also vessels of goldand silver plate, so much as did amount to above ten thousand doubleDuckets more.

　　When the feasting was finished, he caused a Ship to be furnished forthem, graunting them license to depart from Geneway when they pleased;whither they returned most richly and joyfully, being welcomed homewith great honour, especially Madam Genevra, whom every one supposedto be dead; and alwayes after, so long as she lived, shee was mostfamous for her manifold vertues. But as for Ambroginolo, the veriesame day that hee was impaled on the stake, annointed with honey,and fixed in the place appointed, to his no meane torment: he notonely died, but likewise was devoured to the bare bones, by Flies,Waspes, and Hornets, whereof the Countrey notoriously aboundeth. Andhis bones, in full forme and fashion, remained strangely blacke fora long time after, knit together by the sinewes; as a witnesse to manythousands of people, which afterward beheld the Carkasse of hiswickednesse against so good and vertuous a Woman, that had not so muchas a thought of any evill towards him. And thus was the Proverbe trulyverified, that shame succeedeth after ugly sinne, and the deceiveris trampled and trod, by such as himselfe hath deceived.

　　THE SECOND DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN OLDE MEN ARE WITTILY REPREHENDED, THAT WILL MATCH

　　THEMSELVES WITH YOUNGER WOMEN THEN IS FIT FOR THEIR YEERES,

　　AND INSUFFICIENT, NEVER CONSIDERING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO THEM

　　Pagamino da Monaco, a roving Pyrate on the Seas, carried away thefayre Wife of Signior Ricciardo de Chinzica, who understanding whereshee was, went thither; and falling into friendship with Pagamino,demanded his Wife of him; whereto he yeelde, provided, that sheewould willing goe away with him. She denied to part thence with herHusband, and Signior Ricciardo dying, she became the wife of Pagamino.

　　Every one in this honest and gracious assembly, most highlycommended the Novell re-counted by the Queene: but especially Dioneus,who remained to finish that dayes pleasure with his owne Discourse,and after many praises of the former tale were past, thus he began.Faire Ladies, part of the Queenes Novell hath made an alteration of myminde, from that which I intended to proceede next withall, andtherfore I will report another. I cannot forget the unmanlyindiscretion of Bernardo, but much more the base arrogance ofAmbroginolo, how justly deserved shame fell upon him, as well it mayhappen to all other, that are so vile in their owne opinions, as heapparantly approved himselfe to be. For, as men wander abroad in theworld, according to their occasions in diversity of Countries andobservations of the peoples behaviour; so are their humours asvariously transported. And if they finde women wantonly disposedabroade, the like judgement they give of their Wives at home; as ifthey had never knowne their birth and breeding, or made proofe oftheir loyall carriage towards them. Wherefore, the Tale that I purposeto relate, will likewise condemne all the like kind of men, but moreespecially such as thinke themselves endued with more strength thenNature meant to bestow on them, foolishly beleeving, that they cancover their owne defects by fabulous demonstrations, and thinking tofashion other of their owne complexions, that are meerely strangers tosuch grosse follies.Know then, that there lived in Pisa (some hundred yeeres beforeTuscany and Liguria embraced the Christian faith) a judge betterstored with wisedome and ingenuity, then corporall abilities of thebody, named Signior Ricciardo di Cinzica. He being more then halfeperswaded, that hee could content a woman with such satisfaction ashee daily bestowed on his studies, being a widdower, and extraordinarywealthy, laboured with no meane paines, to enjoy a faire and youthfullwife in marriage: both which qualities hee should much rather haveavoyded, if he could have ministred as good counsell to himselfe, ashe did to others, resorting to him for advice. Upon this his amorousand diligent inquisition, it came so to passe, that a worthyGentlewoman, called Bertolomea, one of the fairest and choisest yongmaids in Pisa, whose youth did hardly agree with his age; but muck wasthe motive of this mariage, and no expectation of mutuall contentment.The Judge being married, and the Bride brought solemnly home to hishouse, we need make no question of brave cheare and banquetting,well furnished by their friends on either side: other matters were nowhammering in the judges head, for thogh he could please all hisClients with counsel, yet now such a suit was commenced againsthimselfe, and in Beauties Court of continuall requests, that the Judgefailing in plea for his own defence, was often nonsuited by lack ofanswer; yet he wanted not good wines, drugs, and all sorts ofrestoratives to comfort the heart, and encrease good blood: but allavailed not.

　　But well fare a good courage, where performance faileth, hee couldliberally commend his passed joviall daies, and make a promise of asfaire felicities yet to come; because his youth would renew it selfelike to the Eagle, and his vigour in as full force as before. Butbeside all these ydle allegations, would needs instruct his wife in anAlmanacke or Kalender, which he had (formerly) bought at Ravenna,and wherein he plainely shewed her, that there was not one day inthe yeere, but it was dedicated to some Saint or other. In reverenceof whom, and for their sakes, he approved by divers arguments andreasons, that a man and his wife ought to abstaine from beddingtogether. Adding withall, that those Saints dayes had their Fastsand Feasts, beside the foure seasons of the yeer, the vigils of theApostles, and a thousand other holy dayes, with Fridayes,Saterdayes, and Sundayes, in honor of our Lords rest, and al theholy time of Lent; as also certain observations of the Moone, andinfinit other exceptions beside; thinking perhaps, that it was asconvenient for men to refraine from their wives conversation, as hedid often time from sitting in the Court. These were his daylydocuments to his young wife, wherewith (poore soule) she became sotyred, as nothing could be more irksom to her, and very careful hewas, lest any other should teach her what belonged to working daies,because he would have her know none but holy daies. It came topasse, that the season waxing extremely hot, Signior Ricciardo wouldgo to recreate himselfe at his house in the country, neere to theblacke Mountaine, where for his faire wives more contentment, hecontinued divers daies together. And for her further recreation, hegave order to have a day of fishing, he going aboord a small Pinnaceamong the Fishers, and she in another, consorted with divers otherGentlewomen, in whose company she was very well pleased. Delightmade them launch further into the Sea, then either the Judge waswilling they should have done, or agreed with their owne safety. Forsodainly a Galliot came upon them, wherein was one Pagamino a famousPyrate, who espying the two Pinnaces, made presently to them, andseized on that wherein the women were. When he beheld there so faire ayoung Woman, he coveted after no other purchase; but mounting her intohis Galliot, in the sight of Signior Ricciardo, who by this time wasfearefully landed, he carried her away with him. When Signior Judgehad seene this theft (he being so jealous of his wife, as scarselyhe would let the ayre breathe on her) it were needlesse to knowwhether he was offended, or no. He made complaint at Pisa, and inother places beside, what injurie he had sustained by those Pyrates,in carrying away his wife from him: but all in vaine, he neither (asyet) knew the man, nor what was become of him. Pagamino perceivingwhat a beautifull woman shee was, made the more precious esteeme ofhis purchase, and being himselfe a Batchelor, intended to keepe her ashis owne, comforting her with kinde and pleasing speeches, not usingany ill demeanor to her, because she wept and lamented greevously. Butwhen night came, her husbands Kalender falling from her girdle, andall the fasts and feasts quite out of her remembrance, she receivedsuch curtesies from Pagamino, that before they could arrive at Monaco,the Judge and his Law cases were almost out of memory; such was hisaffable behaviour to her, and she began to converse with him in morefriendly manner, and he entreated her as honourably, as if she had binhis espoused wife.

　　Within a short while after, report had acquainted the Judge, whereand how his wife was kept from him; whereupon hee determined, not tosend, but rather to go himselfe in person, and to redeeme her from thePyrate, with what summes of money he should demand. By sea he passedto Monaco, where he saw his wife, and she him, as (soone after) sheemade known to Pagamino. The next morning, Signior Ricciardo meetingwith Pagamino, made meanes to be acquainted with bim, and within lessethen an houres space, they grew into familiar conference; Pagamino yetpretending not to know him, but expected what issue this talke wouldsort to. When time served, the Judge discoursed the occasion of hiscomming thither, desiring him to demand what ransome he pleased, andthat he might have his wife home with him. Whereto Pagamino answered.

　　My Lord Judge, you are welcome hither, and to answer you breefelyvery true it is, that I have a yong Gentlewoman in my house, whom Ineither know to be your wife, or any other mans else whatsoever: for Iam ignorant both of you and her, albeit she hath remained a while herewith me. If you be her husband, as you seeme to avouch, I will bringher to you, for you appeare to be a worthy Gentleman, and(questionlesse) she cannot chuse but know you perfectly. If she doconfirme that which you have saide, and be willing to depart hencewith you: I shal rest well satisfied, and will have no otherrecompence for her ransome (in regard of your grave and reverendyeeres) but what your selfe shall please to give me. But if it fallout other then you have affirmed, you shal offer me great wrong, inseeking to get her from me; because I am a young man, and can aswell maintaine so faire a wife as you, or any man else that I know.Beleeve it certainly, replyed the judge, that she is my wife, and ifyou please to bring me where she is, you shall soone perceive it:for she will presently cast her armes about my necke, and I durstadventure the utter losse of her, if she deny to do it in yourpresence. Come on then, saide Pagamino, and let us delay the time nolonger.

　　When they were entred into Pagaminos house, and sat downe in theHall, he caused her to be called, and she (being readily preparedfor the purpose), came forth of her Chamber before them both, wherefriendly they sate conversing together; never uttering any word untoSignieur Ricciardo, or knowing him from any other stranger, thatPagamino might bring into the house with him. Which when my Lord theJudge beheld, (who expected to finde a farre more gracious welcome) hestoode as a man amazed, saying to himselfe. Perhaps theextraordinary greefe and melancholly suffered by me since the timeof her losse, hath so altred my wonted complexion, that shee is notable to take knowledge of me. Wherefore, going neerer to her, hesaide: Faire Love, deerely have I bought your going on fishing,because never man felt the like afflictions as I have done since theday when I lost you: but by this your uncivil silence, you seeme as ifyou did not know me. Why deerest love, seest thou not that I am thyhusband Ricciardo, who am come to pay what ransome this Gentlemanshall demaund, even in the house where now we are, so to convey theehome againe, upon his kind promise of thy deliverance, after thepayment of thy ransome?

　　Bertolomea turning towards him, and seeming as if shee smiled to herselfe, thus answered. Sir, speake you to me? Advise your selfe well,least you mistake me for some other, for mine owne part, I never sawyou till now. How now quoth Ricciardo? Consider better what you say,looke more circumspectly on me, and then you will remember, that Iam your loving husband, and my name is Ricciardo di Cinzica. Youmust pardon me Sir, replyed Bertolomea, I know it not so fitting for amodest; woman to stand gazing in the faces of men: and let me lookeuppon you never so often, certaine I am, that (till this instant) Ihave not seene you. My Lord Judge conceived in his minde, that thusshe denied all knowledge of him, as standing in feare of Pagamino, andwould not confesse him in his presence. Wherefore hee entreated ofPagamino, to affoord him so much favour, that he might speake alonewith her in her Chamber. Pagamino answered, that he was well contentedtherewith, provided, that he should not kisse her against her will.Then he requested Bartolomea, to goe with him alone into herChamber, there to heare what he could say, and to answere him asshee found occasion. When they were come into the Chamber, and nonethere present but he and shee, Signior Ricciardo began in this manner.Heart of my heart, life of my life, the sweetest hope that I have inthis world; wilt thou not know thine owne Ricciardo, who loveth theemore then he doth himselfe? Why art thou so strange? Am I sodisfigured, that thou knowest me not? Behold me with a more pleasingeye, I pray thee.

　　Bartolomea smiled to her self and without suffering him to proceedany further in speech, returned him this answere. I would have youto understand Sir, that my memory is not so oblivious, but I knowyou to be Signior Ricciardo di Cinzica, and my husband by name ortitle, but during the time that I was with you, it very ill appearedthat you had any knowledge of me. For if you had bene so wise andconsiderate, as (in your own judgement) the world reputed you to be,you could not be voide of so much apprehension, but did apparantlyperceive, that I was yong, fresh, and cheerefully disposed; and so (byconsequent) meet to know matters requisite for such young women,beside allowance of food and garments, though bashfulnesse and modestyforbid to utter it. But if studying the Lawes were more welcome to youthen a wife, you ought not to have maried, and you loose the worthyreputation of a judge, when you fall from that venerable profession,and make your selfe a common proclaimer of feasts and fasting dayes,lenten seasons, vigils, and solemnities due to Saints, which prohibitethe houshold conversation of husbands and wives.

　　Here am I now with a worthy Gentleman, that entertaineth me withvery honourable respect, and here I live in this Chamber, not somuch as hearing of any feasts or fasting dayes; for, neither Fridaies,Saturdaies, vigils of Saints, or any lingering Lent, enter at thisdoore: but heere is honest and civill conversation, better agreeingwith a youthfull disposition, then those harsh documents wherewith yoututord me. Wherefore my purpose is to continue here with him, as beinga place sutable to my minde and youth, referring feasts, vigils, andfasting daies, to a more mature and stayed time of age, when thebody is better able to endure them, and the mind may be prepared forsuch ghostly meditations: depart therefore at your owne pleasure,and make much of your Calender, without enjoying any company ofmine, for you heare my resolved determination.

　　The Judge hearing these words, was overcome with exceeding griefe,and when she was silent, thus he began. Alas deare Love, what ananswere is this? Hast thou no regard of thine owne honor, thy Parents,and friends? Canst thou rather affect to abide here, for the pleasuresof this man, and so sin capitolly, then to live at Pisa in the stateof my wife? Consider deare heart, when this man shall waxe weary ofthee, to thy shame and his owne disgrace, he will reject thee. Imust and shall love thee for ever, and when I dye, I leave thee Ladyand commandresse of all that is mine. Can an inordinate appetite,cause thee to be carelesse of thine honour, and of him that loves theeas his owne life? Alas, my fairest hope, say no more so, but returnehome with me, and now that I am acquainted with thy inclination; Iwill endeavour heereafter to give thee better contentment. Wherefore(deare heart) doe not denie me, but change thy minde, and goe with me,for I never saw merry day since I lost thee.Sir (quoth she) I desire no body to have care of mine honour,beside my selfe, because it cannot be here abused. And as for myParents, what respect had they of me, when they made me your wife?If then they could be so carelesse of mee, what reason have I toregard them now? And whereas you taxe me, that I cannot live herewithout capitall sin; farre is the thought thereof from me: for,here I am regarded as the wife of Pagamino, but at Pisa, you reputedme not worthy your society: because, by the point of the Moone, andthe quadratures of Geometrie; the Planets held conjunction betweeneyou and me, whereas here I am subject to no such constellations. Yousay beside, that hereafter you will strive to give me bettercontentment then you have done; surely, in mine opinion it is no waypossible, because our complexions are so farre different, as yce isfrom fire, or gold from drosse. As for your allegation, of thisGentlemans rejecting me, when his humour is satisfied; should it proveto be so (as it is the least part of my feare) what fortune soevershall betide me, never will I make any meanes to you, what miseries ormisadventures may happen to me; but the world will affoord me oneresting place or other, and more to my contentment, then if I werewith you. Therefore I tell you once againe, to live secured from alloffence to holy Saints, and not to injure their feasts, fasts,vigills, and other ceremonious seasons: here is my demourance, andfrom hence I purpose not to part.

　　Our Judge was now in a wofull perplexity, and confessing hisfolly, in marying a wife so young, and far unfit for his age andabilitie: being halfe desperate, sad and displeased, he came forthof the Chamber, using divers speeches to Pagamino, whereof he madelittle or no account at all: and in the end, without any othersuccesse, left his wife there, and returned home to Pisa. Therefurther afflictions fell upon him, because the people began toscorne him, demanding dayly of him, what was become of his gallantyoung wife, making hornes, with ridiculous pointings at him: wherebyhis sences became distracted, so that he ran raving about thestreetes, and afterward died in very miserable manner. Which newescame no sooner to the eare of Pagamino, but, in the honourableaffection hee bare to Bertolomea, he maried her, with great solemnity;banishing all Fasts, Vigils, and Lents from his house, and living withher in much felicity. Wherfore (faire Ladies) I am of opinion, thatBernardo of Geneway, in his disputation with Ambroginolo; might haveshewne himselfe a great deale wiser, and sparing his rash proceedingwith his wife.

　　This tale was so merrily entertained among the whole company, thateach one smiling upon another, with one consent commended Dioneus,maintaining that he spake nothing but the truth, and condemningBernardo for his cruelty. Upon a generall silence commanded, the Queenperceiving that the time was now very farre spent, and every one haddelivered their severall Novels, which likewise gave a period to herRoyalty: she gave the Crowne to Madam Neiphila, pleasantly speaking toher in this order. Heereafter, the government of these few people iscommitted to your trust and care, for with the day concludeth mydominion. Madam Neiphila, blushing; at the honor done unto her, hercheekes appeared of a vermillion tincture, her eyes glittering withgracefull desires, and sparkeling like the morning Starre. And afterthe modest murmure of the Assistants was ceased, and her courage inchearfull manner setled, seating her selfe higher then she did before,thus she spake.

　　Seeing it is so, that you have elected me your Queene, to variesomewhat from the course observed by them that went before me, whosegovernement you have all so much commended: by approbation of yourcounsell, I am desirous to speake my mind, concerning what I wold haveto be next followed. It is not unknowne to you all, that to morrowshal be Friday, and Saturday the next day following, which are daiessomewhat molestuous to the most part of men, for preparation oftheir weekly food and sustenance. Moreover, Friday ought to bereverendly respected, in remembrance of him, who died to give us life,and endured his bitter passion, as on that day; which makes me to holdit fit and expedient, that wee should mind more weight), matters,and rather attend our prayers and devotions then the repetition oftales or Novels. Now concerning Saturday, it hath bin a customeobserved among women, to bath and wash themselves from suchimmundicities as the former weekes toile hath imposed on them. Beside,it is a day of fasting, in honour of the ensuing Sabbath, whereon nolabor may be done, but the observation of holy exercises.

　　By that which hath bin saide, you may easily conceive, that thecourse which we have hitherto continued, cannot bee prosecuted inone and the same manner: where. fore, I would advise and do hold it anaction wel performed by us, to cease for these few dayes, fromrecounting any other Novels. And because we have remained here fouredaies already, except we would allow the enlarging of our company,with some other friends that may resort unto us: I thinke it necessaryto remove from hence, and take our pleasure in another place, which isalready by me determined. When we shalbe there assembled, and haveslept on the discourses formerly delivered, let our next argument bestill the mutabilities of Fortune, but especially to concerne suchpersons, as by their wit and ingenuity, industriously have attained tosome matter earnestly desired, or else recovered againe, after thelosse. Heereon let us severally study and premeditate, that thehearers may receive benefit thereby, with the comfortablemaintenance of our harmelesse recreations; the priviledge of Dioneusalwayes reserved to himselfe.

　　Every one commended the Queens deliberation, concluding that itshold be accordingly prosecuted: and thereupon, the master of thehoushold was called, to give him order for that evenings Tableservice, and what else concerned the time of the Queenes Royalty,wherein he was sufficiently instructed: which being done, thecompany arose, licensing every one to doe what they listed. The Ladiesand Gentlemen walked to the Garden, and having sported themselvesthere a while; when the houre of supper came, they sate downe, andfared very daintily. Being risen from the Table, according to theQueenes command, Madam Aemilia led the dance, and the ditty following,was sung by Madam Pampinea, being answered by all the rest, as aChorus.

　　THE SONG

　　And if not I, what Lady else can sing,

　　Of those delights, which kind contentment bring?

　　Come, come, sweet Love, the cause of my chiefe good,

　　Of all my hopes, the firme and full effect;

　　Sing wee together, but in no sad mood,

　　Of sighes or teares, which joy doth countercheck:

　　Stolne pleasures are delightfull in the taste,

　　But yet Loves fire is oftentimes too fierce;

　　Consuming comfort with ore-speedy haste,

　　Which into gentle hearts too far doth pierce.

　　And if not I, etc.

　　The first day that I felt this fiery heate,

　　So sweete a passion did possesse my soule,

　　That though I found the torment sharp, and great;

　　Yet still me thought t'was but a sweete controule.

　　Nor could I count it rude, or rigorous,

　　Taking my wound from such a piercing eye:

　　As made the paine most pleasing, gracious,

　　That I desire in such assaults to die.

　　And if not I, etc.

　　Grant then great God of Love, that I may still

　　Enjoy the benefit of my desire;

　　And honour her with all my deepest skill,

　　That first enflam'd my heart with holy fire.

　　To her my bondage is free liberty,

　　My sicknesse health, my tortures sweet repose;

　　Say shee the word, in full felicity

　　All my extreames joyne in an happy close.

　　Then if not I, what Lover else can sing,

　　Of those delights which kind contentment bring?

　　After this Song was ended, they sung divers other beside, and havinggreat variety of instruments' they played to them as many pleasingdances. But the Queene considering that the meete houre for rest wascome, with their lighted Torches before them, they all repaired totheir Chambers; sparing the other dayes next succeeding, for thosereasons by the Queene alledged, and spending the Sunday in solemnedevotion.

　　The morning put on a vermillion countenance and made the Sunne torise blushing red, when the Queene (and all the faire company) werecome abroad forth of their Chambers; the Seneshall or great Masterof the Houshold, having (long before); sent all things necessary tothe place of their next intended meeting. And the people whichprepared there every needfull matter, suddainely when they saw theQueene was setting forward, charged all the rest of their followers,as if it had beene prepatation for a Campe; to make hast away with thecarriages, the rest of the Familie remaining behind, to attend uponthe Ladies and Gentlemen.

　　With a milde, majesticke, and gentle pace, the Queene rode on, beingfollowed by the other Ladies, and the three young Gentlemen, takingtheir way towards the West; conducted by the musicall notes ofsweete singing Nightingales, and infinite other pretty Birds beside,riding in a tract not much frequented, but richly abounding with fairehearbes and flowres, which by reason of the Sunnes high mounting,beganne to open their bosome.

　　But, after the dayes warmth was more mildely qualified, and everyone had made benefit of their best content: they went (by order sentfrom the Queene) into the Meadow where the Fountaine stood, andbeing set about it, as they used to do in telling their Tales (theargument appointed by the Queene being propounded) the first thathad the charge imposed, was Philostratus, who began in this manner.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THAT VIRGINITY IS VERY HARDLY TO BE

　　KEPT IN ALL PLACES

　　Massetto di Lamporechio, by counterfetting himselfe to be dumbe,became a Gardiner in a Monastery of Nunnes, where he had familiarconversation with them all.

　　Most worthy Ladies, there wants no store of men and women, thatare so simple, as to credit for a certainty, that so soon as a yongvirgin hath the veile put on hir head, and the black Cowle given tocover withall, she is no longer a woman, nor more sensible of feminineaffections, then as if in turning Nun, shee became converted to astone. And if (perchance) they heard some matters, contrary to theirformer perswasion; then they grow so furiously offended, as if one hadcommitted a most foule and enormous sinne, directly against the courseof Nature. And the torrent of this opinion burries them on soviolently, that they wil admit no leisure to consider, how (in sucha scope of liberty) they have power to doe what they list, yeabeyond all meanes of sufficient satisfying, never remembring howpotent the priviledge of idlenes is, especially when it is backt bysolitude. In like manner, there are other people now, who verilybeleeve, that the Spade and Pickaxe, grosse feeding and labour, doquench al sensual and fleshly concupiscence, yea, in such as tilland husband the ground, by making them dull, blockish, and (almost)meere senslesse of understanding. But I will approve (according as theQueene hath commanded me, and within the compasse of her direction) bya short and pleasant Tale; how greatly they are abused by errour, thatbuild upon so weake a foundation.

　　Not farre from Alexandria, there was a great and goodlyMonasterie, belonging to the Lord of those parts, who is termed theAdmirall. And therein, under the care and trust of one woman, diversvirgins were kept as recluses, or Nuns, vowed to chastity of life; outof whose number, the Soldan of Babylon (under whom they lived insubjection) at every three yeers end, had usually three of thesevirgins sent him. At the time wherof I am now to speake, thereremained in the Monastery, no more but eight religious Sisters only,beside the Lady Abbesse, and an honest poor man, who was a Gardiner,and kept the Garden in commendable order.

　　His wages being small, and he not well contented therewith, wouldserve there no longer: but making his accounts even, with the Factotumor Bayliffe belonging to the house, returned thence to the villageof Lamporechio, being a native of the place. Among many other thatgave him welcom home, was a yong Hebrew pezant of the country, sturdy,strong and yet comely of person, being named Masset. But because hewas born not farre off from Lamporechio, and had there bin broughtup all his yonger dayes, his name of Masset (according to their vulgarspeech) was turnec to Massetto, and therefore he was usually calledand knowne by the name of Massetto of Lamporechio.

　　Massetto, falling in talke with the honest poore man, whose name wasLurco, demanded of him what services hee had done in the Monasterie,having continued there so long a time? Quoth Lurco, I laboured inthe Garden, which is very faire and great; then I went to the Forestto fetch home wood, and cleft it for their Chamber fuell, drawing upall theyr water beside, with many other toilsome services else: butthe allowance of my wages was so little, as it would not pay for theshoes I wore. And that which was worst of all, they being all women, Ithinke the divel dwels among g them, for a man cannot doe any thing toplease them. When I have bene busie at my worke in the garden, onewould come and say, Put this heere, put that there; and others wouldtake the dibble out of my hand, telling me, that I did not performeany thing well, making me so weary of their continuall trifling, asI have lefte all busines, given over the Garden, and what for onemollestation, as also many other; I intended to tarry no longer there,but came away, as thou seest. And yet the Factotum desired me at mydeparting, that if I knew any one who would undertake the aforesaidlabours, I should send him thither, as (indeed) I promised to do:but let mee fall sicke and dye, before I helpe to send them any.

　　When Massetto had heard the words of Lurco, hee was so desirous todwell among the Nunnes, that nothing else now hammered in his head:for he meant more subtilly than poore Lurco did, and made no doubtto please them sufficiently. Then considering with himselfe, howbest he might bring his intent to effect; which appeared not easily tobee done. He could question no further therein with Lurco, but onelydemaunded other matter of him, saying: Introth thou didst wellLurco, to come away from so tedious a dwelling, had he need to be morethen a man that is to live with such women? It were better for himto dwell among so many divels, because they understand not the tenthpart that womens wily wits can dive into.

　　After their conference was ended, Massetto began to beate hisbraines how he might compasse to dwell among them, and knowing that hecould wel enough performe all the labours whereof Lurco had mademention, he cared not for any losse he should sustaine thereby, butonely stood in doubt of his entertainment, because he was too yong andsprightly. Having pondered on many imaginations, he said tohimselfe. The place is farre enough distant hence, and none therecan take knowledge of mee; if I have wit sufficient, cleanely tomake them beleeve that I am dumbe, then (questionles) I shal bereceived. And resolving to prosecute this determination, he tooke aSpade on his shoulder, and without revealing to any body whether heewent, in the disguise of a poore labouring Countryman, he travelled tothe Monastery.

　　When he was there arrived, he found the great gate open, andentering in boldly, it was his good hap to espy the Fac-totum in thecourt, according as Lurco had given description of him. Makingsignes before him, as if he were both dumbe and deafe; hemanifested, that he craved an Almes for Gods sake, making shewesbeside, that if need required, he could cleave wood, or doe anyreasonable kinde of service. The Factotum gladly gave him food, andafterward shewed him divers knotty logs of wood, which the weakestrength of Lurco had left uncloven; but this fellow being more activeand lusty, quickly rent them all to pieces. Now it so fell out, thatthe Fac-totum must needs go to the Forrest, and tooke Massetto alongwith him thither: where causing him to fell divers Trees, by signes hebad him to the two Asses therewith, which commonly carried home allthe wood, and so drive them to the Monasterie before him, whichMassetto knew well enough how to do, and performed it veryeffectually.

　　Many other servile Offices were there to bee done, which causedthe Fac-totum to make use of his paines divers other dayes beside;in which time, the Lady Abbesse chancing to see him, demanded of theFactotum what he was? Madani (quoth hee) a poore labouring man, who isboth deafe and dumbe, hither he came to crave an almes the otherday, the which in charity I could do no lesse but give him; for which,hee hath done many honest services about the house. It seemesbeside, that hee hath pretty skill in Gardening, so that if I canperswade him to continue here, I make no question of his ableservices: for the old silly man is gon, and we have need of such astout fellow, to do the busines belonging to the Monastery, and onefitter for the turne, comes sildome hither. Moreover, in regard of hisdouble imperfections, the Sisters can sustaine no impeachment byhim. Whereto the Abbesse answered, saying; By the faith of my body,you speake but the truth: understand then, if hee have any knowledgein Gardening, and whether hee will dwell heere, or no: whichcompasse so kindly as you can. Let him have a new paire of shoes, fillhis belly daily full of meate, flatter, and make much of him, forwee shall finde him worke enough to do. All which, the Fac-totumpromised to fulfill sufficiently.

　　Massetto, who was not far off from them all this while, but seemedseriously busied about sweeping and making cleane the Court, heard allthese speeches; and being not a little joyfull of them; said tohimselfe. If once I come to worke in your Garden, let the proofe yeeldpraise of my skill and knowledge. When the Fac-totum perceived, thathe knew perfectly how to undergo his businesse, and had questioned himby signes, concerning his willingnesse to serve there still, andreceived the like answere also, of his dutifull readinesse thereto; hegave him order to worke in the Garden, because the season did nowrequire it; and to leave all other affayres for the Monastery,attending now onely the Gardens preparation.

　　As Massetto was thus about his Garden emploiment, the Nunnes beganto resort thither, and thinking the man to be dumbe and deafe indeede,were the more lavish of their language, mocking and flowting himvery immodestly, as being perswaded, that he heard them not. And theLady Abbesse, thinking he might as well be an Eunuch, as deprived bothof hearing and speaking, stood the lesse in feare of the Sisterswalkes, but referred them to their owne care and providence. On a day,Massetto having laboured somewhat extraordinarily, lay downe to resthimselfe awhile under the trees, and two delicate yong Nunnes, walkingthere to take the aire, drew neere to the place where he dissembledsleeping; and both of them observing his comelinesse of person,began to pitty the poverty of his condition; but much more themisery of his great defectes. Then one of them, who had a littlelivelier spirit then the other, thinking Massetto to be fastasleepe, began in this manner.

　　Sister (quoth she) if I were faithfully assured of thy secrecie, Iwould tell thee a thing which I have often thought on, and it may(perhaps) redound to thy profit. Sister, replyed the other Nun, speakeyour minde boldly, and beleeve it (on my Maidenhead) that I will neverreveale it to any creature living. Encouraged by this solemne answere,the first Nun thus prosecuted her former purpose, saying. I know notSister, whether it hath entred into thine understanding or no,strictly we are here kept and attended, never any man daring toadventure among us, except our good and bonest Fac-totum, who isvery aged; and this dumbe fellow, maimed, and made imperfect bynature, and therefore not worthy the title of a man. Ah Sister, ithath oftentimes bin told me, by Gentlewomen comming hither to visiteus, that all other sweetes in the world, are mockeries, to theincomparable pleasures of man and woman, of which we are barred by ourunkind parents, binding us to perpetuall chastity, which they werenever able to observe themselves.

　　A Sister of this house once told me, that before her turne came tobe sent to the Soldane, she fell in frailty with a man that was bothlame and blinde, and discovering the same to her Ghostly Father inconfession; he absolved her of that sinne; affirming, that she had nottransgressed with a man, because he wanted his rationall andunderstanding parts. Behold Sister, heere lyes a creature, almostformed in the self-same mold, dumbe and deafe, which are two themost rationall and understanding parts that do belong to any man,and therefore no Man, wanting them. If folly and frailty would becommitted with him (as many times since hee came hither it hath run inmy minde) hee is by Nature, sworne to such secrecie, that he cannot(if he would) be a blabbe thereof. Beside, the Lawes andconstitution of our Religion doth teach us, that a sinne soassuredly concealed, is more then halfe absolved.

　　Ave Maria Sister (saide the other Nun) what kinde of words are theseyou utter? Doe not you know, that we have promised our virginity toGod? Oh Sister (answered the other) how many things are promised tohim every day, and not one of a thousand kept or performed? If weehave made him such a promise, and some of our weakerwitted sistersdo performe it for us, no doubt but he will accept it in part ofpayment. Yea but Sister, replied the second Nun againe, there isanother danger lying in the way: If we prove to be with childe, howshall we doe then? Sister (quoth our couragious wench) thou artaffraide of harme before it happen: if it come so to passe, let usconsider on it then: thou art but a Novice in matters of suchmoment, we are provided of a thousand meanes, whereby to preventconception. Or, if they should faile, we are so surely fitted, thatthe world shall never know it. Let it suffice, our lives must not beby any so much as suspected, our Monastery questioned, or our Religionrashly scandalized. Thus shee schooled her younger Sister in wit,albeit as forward as shee in will, and longed as desirouslie, toknow what kinde of creature man was.

　　After some other questions, how this intention of theirs might beesafely brought to full effect: the sprightly Nun that had wit at will,thus answered. You see Sister (quoth she) it is now the houre ofmidday, when all the rest of our sisterhood are quiet in theirChambers, because we are then allowed to sleep, for our earlier risingto morning Mattins. Here are none in the Garden now but our selves,and while I awake him, bee you the watch, and afterward follow meein my fortune, for I will valiantly leade you the way. Massettoimmitating a Dogges sleepe, heard all this conspiracie intendedagainst him, and longed as earnestly till shee came to awake him.Which being done, he seeming very simple and sottish, and she chearinghim with flattering behaviour: into the close Arbour they went,which the Sunnes bright eye could not pierce into, and there I leaveit to the Nunnes owne approbation, whether Massetto was a manrationall, or no. Ill deeds require longer time to contrive, then act;and both the Nuns having bene with Massetto at this new forme ofconfession, were enjoyned (by him) such an easie and silent penance,as brought them the oftner to shrift, and made him to proove a veryperfect Confessour.

　　Desires obtayned, but not fully satisfied, doe commonly urge morefrequent accesse, then wisedome thinkes expedient, or can continuewithout discovery. Our two joviall Nunnes, not a little proud of theirprivate stolne pleasures, so long resorted to the close Arbour, tillanother Sister, who had often observed their haunt thither, bymeanes of a little hole in her Window; that shee began to suspect themwith Massetto, and imparted the same to two other Sisters, all threeconcluding, to accuse them before the Lady Abbesse. But upon a furtherconference had with the Offenders, they changed opinion, tooke thesame oath as the forewomen had done; and because they would be freefrom any taxation at all: they revealed their adventures to theother three ignorants, and so fell all eight into one formallconfederacie, but by good and warie observation, least the Abbesse herselfe should descry them; finding poore Massetto such plenty ofGarden-worke, as made him verie doubtfull in pleasing them all.

　　It came to passe in the end, that the Lady Abbesse who all thiswhile imagined no such matter, walking all alone in the garden on aday, found Massetto sleeping under an Almond tree, having then verylitle businesse to doe, because he had wrought hard all the nightbefore. She observed him to be an hansome man, young, lusty,well-limbde and proportioned, having a mercifull commisseration of hisdumbenesse and deafenes, being perswaded also in like manner, thatif hee were an Eunuch too, hee deserved a thousand times the more tobe pittied. The season was exceeding hot, and he lay downe socarelesly to sleepe, that somthing was noted wherein shee intendedto be better resolved, almost falling sicke of the other Nunnesdisease. Having awaked him, she commanded him by signes that he shouldfollow her to her chamber, where he was kept close so long, that theNunnes grew offended, because the Gardiner came not to his dailylabour.

　　Well may you imagine that Massetto was no misse-proud man now, to bethus advanced from the Garden to the Chamber, and by no worse womanthen the Lady Abbesse her selfe: what signes, shews, or whatlanguage he speaks there, I am not able to expresse; onely itappeared, that his behaviour pleased her so well, as it procured hisdaily repairing thether; and acquainted her with such familiarconversation, as she would have condemned in the Nunnes her daughters,but that they were wise enough to keepe it from her. Now beganMassetto to consider, that hee had undertaken a taske belonging togreat Hercules, in giving content to so many, and by continuingdumbe in this maner, it would redound to his no meane detriment.Whereupon, as he was one night sitting by the Abbesse, the string thatretained his tongue from speech, brake on a sodaine, and thus hespake.

　　Madam, I have often heard it said, that one Cocke may doe service toten several Hennes, but ten men can very hardly even with all theirbest endeavour, give full satisfaction every way to one woman; and yetI am tied to content nine, which is farre beyond the compasse of mypower to do. Already have I performed so much Garden and Chamber-work,that I confesse my selfe starke tired, and can travaile no further,and therefore let me entreate you to lycense my departure hence, orfinde some meanes for my better ease. The Abbesse bearing himspeake, who had so long ben there stricken into admiration, andaccounting it almost a miracle, said. How commeth this to passe? Iverily beleeved thee to be dumbe. Madam (quoth Massetto) so I wasindeed, but not by Nature; onely I had a long lingering sickneswhich bereft me of speech, and which I have not onely recovered againethis night, but shal ever remaine thankfull to you for it.

　　The Abbesse verily credited his answer, demanding what he meant insaying, that he did service to nine? Madam, quoth he, this were adangerous question, and not easily answered before fore the eightSisters. Upon this reply, the Abbesse plainely perceived, that notonely she had fallen into foll but all the Nunnes likewise criedguilty too: wherfore being a woman of sound discretion, she wouldnot grant that Massetto should depart, but to keepe him still aboutthe Nunnes businesse, because the Monastery should not bescandalized by him. And the Fac-totum being dead a little before,his strange recovery of speech revealed, and some things else moreneerely concerning them: by generall consent, and with the good likingof Massetto, he was created the Fac-totum of the Monasterie.

　　All the neighboring people dwelling thereabout, who knew Massetto tobe dumbe, by fetching home wood daily from the Forest, and diversemployments in other places, were made to beleeve, that by theNunnes devout prayers and discipline, as also the merite of the Saint,in whose honour the Monastery was built and erected, Massetto hadhis long restrained speech restored, and was now become their soleFactotum, having power now to employ others in drudgeries, and easehimselfe of all such labours. And albeit he made the Nunnes to befruitfull, by encreasing some store of yonger sisters, yet all matterswere so close and cleanly catried, as it was never talkt of, tillafter the death of the Ladie Abbesse, when Massetto beganne to grow ingood yeeres, and desired to returne home to his native abiding,which (within a while after) was granted him.

　　Thus Massetto being rich and olde, returned home like a wealthyfather, taking no care for the nursing of his children, but bequeathedthem to the place where they were bred and borne, having (by his witand ingenious apprehension) made such a benefit of his youthfullyeeres, that now he merrily tooke ease in his age.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS SIGNIFIED, THE PROVIDENCE OF A WISE MAN, WHEN

　　HE SHALL HAVE REASON TO USE REVENGE. AND THE CUNNING MEANES

　　OF ANOTHER, WHEN HEE  COMPASSETH CRAFT TO DEFEND HIMSELFE

　　FROM PERILL

　　A querry of the Stable, belonging to Agilulffo, King of theLombardes, found the meanes of accesse to the Queenes bed, without anyknowledge or consent in her. This being secretly discovered by theKing, and the party known, he gave him a marke, by shearing thehaire of his head. Whereupon, he that was so shorne, shearedlikewise the heads of all his fellowes in the lodging, and soescaped the punishment intended towards him.

　　When the Novel of Philostratus was concluded, which made some of theLadies blush, and the rest to smile: it pleased the Queene, that MadamPampinea should follow next, to second the other gone before; whenshe, smiling on the whole assembly, began thus. There are some menso shallow of capacity, that they will (neverthelesse) make shew ofknowing and understanding such things, as neither they are able todoe, nor appertaine to them: whereby they will sometimes reprehendother new errours, and such faults as they have unwillingly committed,thinking thereby to hide their owne shame, when they make it much moreapparant and manifest. For proofe whereof, faire company, in acontrary kinde I will shew you the subtill cunning of one, who(perhaps) may bee reputed of lesse reckning then Massetto; and yethe went beyond a King, that thought himselfe to be a much wiser man.

　　Agilulffo, King of Lombardie, according as his Predecessours haddone before him, made the principall seate of his Kingdome, in theCitie of Pavia, having embraced in mariage, Tendelinga, the lateleft widdow of Vetario, who likewise had beene King of the Lombards; amost beautifull wife and vertuous Lady, but made unfortunate by amischance. The occurrences and estate of the whole Realme, being in anhonourable, quiet and well setled condition, by the discreete care andprovidence of the King; a Querrie appertaining to the Queenes Stableof Horse, being a man but of meane and low quality, though comely ofperson, and of equall stature to the King; became immeasurably amorousof the Queene. And because his base and servile condition, hadendued him with so much understanding, as to know infallibly, that hisaffection was mounted beyond the compasse of conveniencie: wisely heconcealed it to himselfe, not acquainting any one therewith, or daringso much, as to discover it either by lookes, or any other affectionatebehaviour.

　　And although hee lived utterly hopelesse, of ever attaining to hishearts desires; yet notwithstanding, hee proudly gloried, that hislove had soared so high a pitch, as to be enamoured of a Queene. Anddayly, as the fury of his flame encreased; so his cariage was farreabove his fellowes and companions, in the performing of all suchserviceable duties, as any way he imagined might content the Queene.Whereon ensued, that whensoever shee roade abroad to take the ayre,shee used oftner to mount on the Horse, which this Querrie broughtwhen shee made her choise, then any of the other that were led byhis fellowes. And this did he esteeme as no meane happinesse to him,to order the stirrope for her mounting, and therefore gave dayly hisdue attendance: so that, to touch the Stirrop, but (much more) toput her foote into it, or touch any part of her garments, he thoughtit the onely heaven on earth.

　　But, as we see it oftentimes come to passe, that by how much thelower hope declineth, so much the higher love ascendeth; even sofell it out with this poore Querry; for, most irkesome was it tohim, to endure the heavy waight of his continuall oppressions, nothaving any hope at all of the very least mitigation. And being utterlyunable to relinquish his love divers times he resolved on somedesperate conclusion, which might yet give the world an evidenttestimony, that he dyed for the love he bare to the Queene. And uponthis determination, hee grounded the successe of his future fortune,to dye in compassing some part of his desire, without eitherspeaking to the Queene, or sending any missive of his love; for tospeake or write, were meerely in vaine, and drew on a worserconsequence then death, which he could bestow on himselfe more easily,and when he listed.

　　No other course now beleagers his braines, but onely for secretaccesse to the Queenes bed, and how he might get entrance into herChamber, under colour of the King, who (as he knew very well) sleptmany nights together from the Queene. Wherefore, to see in whatmanner, and what the usuall habit was of the King, when he came tokeepe companie with his Queene: he hid himselfe divers nights in aGallery, which was betweene both their lodging Chambers. At length, hesaw the King come forth of his Chamber, himselfe all alone, with afaire night-mantle wrapt about him, carrying a lighted Taper in theone hand, and a small white Wand in the other, so went he on to theQueenes lodging; and knocking at the doore once or twice with thewand, and not using any word, the doore opened, the light was leftwithout, and he entered the Chamber, where he stayed not long,before his returning backe againe, which likewise very diligently heobserved.

　　So familiar was he in the Wardrobe, by often fetching andreturning the King and Queenes furnitures; that the fellowes to thesame Mantle which the King wore when he went to the Queene, verysecretly he conveighed away thence with him, being provided of aLight, and the very like Wand. Now bestowes he costly bathings onhis body, that the least sent of the Stable might not be felt abouthim; and finding a time sutable to his desire, when he knew the Kingto bee at rest in his owne Lodging, and all else sleeping in theirbed; closely he steals into the Gallery, where alighting his Taper,with the Tinder purposely brought thither, the Mantle folded abouthim, and the Wand in his hand, valiantly he adventures upon hislives perill. Twice hee knockt softly at the doore, which a waytingwoman immediately opened, and receyving the Light, went forth into theGallery, while the supposed King, was conversing with the Queene.

　　Alas good Queene, heere is a sinne commited without any guiltiethought in thee, as (within a while after) it plainely appeared.For, the Querry having compassed what he most coveted, and fearingto forfelte his life by delay, when his amorous desire wasindifferently satisfied: returned backe as he came, the sleepy waitingwoman not so much as looking on him, but rather glad, that she mightget her to rest againe. Scarcely was the Querrie stept into his bed,unheard or discerned by any of his fellowes, divers of them lodgingboth in that and the next Chamber: but it pleased the King to visitethe Queene, according to his wonted manner, to the no littlemervaile of the drowsie wayting woman, who was never twice troubled ina night before. The King being in bed, whereas alwayes till then,his resort to the Queene, was altogether in sadnesse andmelancholly, both comming and departing without speaking one word: nowhis Majestie was become more pleasantly disposing, whereat theQueene began not a little to mervaile. Now trust mee Sir, quothshee, this hath beene a long wished, and now most welcomealteration, vouchsafing twice in a night to visite me, and both withinthe compasse of one houre; for it cannot be much more, since yourbeing here, and now comming againe.

　　The King hearing these words, sodainely presumed, that by somecounterfeit person or other, the Queene had beene this night beguiled:wherefore (very advisedly) hee considered, that in regard the partywas unknowne to her, and all the women about her; to make no outwardappearance of knowing it, but rather concealed it to himselfe. Farrefrom the indiscretion of some haire-braind men, who presently wouldhave answered and sworne; I came hither this night, till now.Whereupon many dangers might ensue, to the dishonour and prejudiceof the Queene: beside, her error being discovered to her, mightafterward be an occasion, to urge a wandring in her appetite, and tocovet after change againe. But by this silence, no shame redoundedto him or her, whereas prating, must needs be the publisher of openinfamie: yet was hee much vexed in his minde, which neither bylookes or words hee would discover, but pleasantly said to the Queene,Why Madam, although I was once heere before to night, I hope youmislike not my second seeing you, nor if I should please to comeagaine. No truly Sir, quoth she, I onely desire you to have care ofyour health. Well, said the King, I will follow your counsaile, andnow returne to mine owne lodging againe, committing my Queene to hergood rest.

　　His blood boyling with rage and distemper, by such a monstrousinjurie offered him; he wrapt his night-mantle about out and leavinghis Chamber, imagining, that whatsoever he was, needs he must be oneof his owne house: he tooke a light in his hand, and convayed itinto a little Lanthorne, purposing to be resolved in his suspition. Noguests or strangers were now in his Court, but onely such asbelonged to his houshold, who lodged altogether about the Escurieand Stables, being there appointed to divers beds. Now, this was hisconceite, that whosoever had beene so lately familiar with the Queene,his heart and his pulse could (as yet) be hardly at rest, but ratherwould be troubled with apparant agitation, as discovering the guilt ofso great an offender. Many Chambers had he passed thorow, where allwere soundly sleeping, and yet he felt both their brests and pulses.

　　At last he came to the lodging of the man indeede, that had soimpudently usurped his place, who could not as yet sleepe, for joyof atchieved adventure. When he espied the King come in, knowingwell the occasion of his search, he began to waxe very doubtfull, sothat his heart and pulse beating extreamely, he felt a furtheraddition of feare, as being confidently perswaded, that there wasnow no other way but death, especially if the King discovered hisagony. And although many considerations were in his braine, yetbecause he saw that the King was unarmed, his best refuge was, to makeshew of sleepe, in expectation what the King intended to doe. Amongthem all he had sought, yet could not find any likelihood, wherebyto gather a grounded probability; he came to this Querry, whoseheart and pulses laboured so strongly, that he said to himselfe, Yeamary, this is th man that did the deede.

　　Nevertheless, purposing to make no apparance of his furtherintention, he did nothing else to him, but drawing forth a paire ofsheares, which purposely he brought thither with him, he clippedaway a part of his lockes, which (in those times) they used to wearevery long, to the end that he might the better know him the nextmorning, and so returned backe to his lodging againe. The Querry,who partly saw, but felt what was done to him; perceived plainely(being a subtill ingenious fellow) for what intent he was thus marked.Wherefore, without any longer dallying, up he rose, and taking a paireof sheares, wherewith they used to trim their Horses; softly he wentfrom bed to bed, where they all lay yet soundly sleeping, and cliptaway each mans locke from his right eare, in the selfe same manneras the King had done his, and being not perceived by any one ofthem, quietly he laide him downe againe.

　　In the morning, when the King was risen, he gave command that beforethe Pallace gates were opened, all his whole Family should come beforehim, as instantly his will was fulfilled. Standing all uncovered inhis presence, he began to consider with himselfe, which of them wasthe man that he had marked. And seeing the most part of them to havetheir lockes cut, all after one and the selfe same manner;marvailing greatly, he saide to himselfe. The man whom I seeke for,though he be but of meane and base condition, yet it plainelyappeareth, that he is of no deject or common understanding. Andseeing, that without further clamour and noyse, he could not findout the party he looked for, he concluded, not to win eternallshame, by compassing a poore revenge: but rather (by way ofadmonition) to let the offender know in a word, that he was both notedand observed. So turning to them all, he saide; He that hath doneit, let him be silent, and doe so no more, and now depart about yourbusinesse.

　　Some other turbulent spirited man, no imprisonments, tortures,examinations, and interrogations, could have served his turne; bywhich course of proceeding, he makes the shame to be publikely knowne,which reason requireth to keepe concealed. But admit that condignevengeance were taken, it diminisheth not one tittle of the shame,neither qualifieth the peoples bad affections, who will lash out asliberally in scandal, and upon the very least babling rumor. Suchtherfore as heard the Kings words, few though they were, yet trulywise; marvelled much at them, and by long examinations amongthemselves, questioned, but came far short of his meaning; the manonely excepted whom indeed they concerned, and by whom they were neverdiscovered, so long as the King lived, neither did he dare at any timeafter, to hazard his life in the like action, under the frownes orfavour of Fortune.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　DECLARING, THAT THE LEWD QUALITIES OF SOME PERSONS, OFTENTIMES

　　MISGUIDE GOOD PEOPLE, INTO GREAT AND GREEVOUS ERRORS.

　　Under colour of Confession, and of a most pure conscience, a faireyong Gentlewoman, being amourously affected to an honest man,induced a devoute and solemne religious Friar, to advise her in themeanes (without his suspition or perceiving) how to enjoy thebenefit of her friend, and bring her desires to their full effect.

　　When Madam Pampinea sate silent, and the Querries boldnesse equalledwith his crafty cunning, and great wisedom in the King had passedamongst them with a generall applause; the Queene turning her selfe toMadam Philomena, appointed her to follow next in order as the rest haddone before her: whereupon Philomena began after this maner.

　　It is my purpose, to acquaint you with a notable mockerie, which wasperformed (not in jest, but earnest) by a faire Gentlewoman, to agrave and devoute Religious Friar, which will yeelde so much themore pleasure and recreation, to every secular understander, if butdiligently he or she doe observe, how commonly those Religious persons(at least the most part of them) like notorious fooles, are theinventers of new courses and customes, as thinking themselves morewise and skilful in all things then any other; yet prove to be of noworth or validity, addicting the verie best of all their devices, toexpresse their owne vilenesse of mind, and fatten themselves intheir styes like to pampered Swine. And assure your selves worthyLadies, that I doe not tell this tale onely to follow the orderenjoyned me; but also to informe you that such Saint-like holy Sirs,of whom we are too opinionate and credulous, may be, yea and are(divers times) cunningly met withall, in theyr craftinesse, notonely by men, but likewise some of our owne sexe, as shall make itapparant to you.

　　In our owne City (more full of craft and deceit, then love orfaithfull dealing) there lived not many yeeres since, a Gentlewoman ofgood spirit, highly minded, endued with beauty and all commendablequalities, as any other woman (by nature) could be. Her name, or anyothers, concerned in this Novel, I meane not to make manifest,albeit I know them, because some are yet living, and thereby may bescindalized; and therefore it shall suffice to passe them over witha smile. This Gentlewoman, seeing her selfe to be descended of verygreat parentage, and (by chance) married to an Artezan, a Cloathyer orDraper, that lived by the making and selling of cloth. Shee couldnot (because he was a Tradesman) take downe the height of her minde;conceiving, that no man of meane condition (how rich soever) wasworthy to enjoy a Gentlewoman in marriage. Observing moreover, thatwith all his wealth and treasure, he understood nothing better, thento open skeines of yarne, fill shuttles lay webbes in his Loomes, ordispute with his Spinsters, about their businesse.

　　Being thus over-swayed with her proud opinion, she would no longerbe embraced or regarded by him in any manner, saving only becauseshe could not refuse him, but would find some other for her bettersatisfaction, who might seeme more worthy of her respect, then theDraper her Husband did. Heereupon shee fell so deepe in love with averie honest man of our City also, and of indifferent yeeres, aswhat day shee saw him not, shee could take no rest the nightensuing. The man himselfe knew nothing hereof, and therefore was themore carelesse: and she being curious, nice, yet wisely considerate,durst not let him understand it, neither by any womans closeconveyed message, nor yet by Letters, as fearing the perils whichhappen in such cases. But her eye observing his dayly walkes andresorts, gave her notice of his often conversing with a religiousFriar, who albeit he was a fat and corpulent man, yet notwithstanding,because he seemed to leade a sanctimonious life, and was reported tobe a most honest man, she perswaded her selfe, that he might be thebest meanes betweene her and her friend.

　　Having considered with her selfe, what course was best to beobserved in this case; uppon a day apt and convenient, she went to theConvent where he kept, and having caused him to be called, shee toldhim, that if his leysure so served, very gladly would she beconfessed, and onely had made her choice of him. The holy man seeingher to be a Gentlewoman (as indeed she was) willingly heard her; andwhen she had confessed what she could, she had yet another matter toacquaint him withall, and thereupon thus she began.

　　Holy Father, it is no more then convenient that I should haverecourse to you, to be assisted by your helpe and counsell, in amatter which I will impart unto you. I know, that you are not ignorantof my parents and husband, of whom I am affected as deerely as hislife, for proofe whereof, there is not any thing that I can desire,but immediately I have it of him, he being a most rich man, and mayvery sufficiently affoord it. In regard whereof, I love him equally asmy selfe, and (setting aside my best endevours for him) I must tellyou one thing quite contrary to his liking and honour: no womancould more worthily deserve death, then my selfe. Understand then(good Father) that there is a man, whose name I know not, but heseemeth to be honest, and of good worth; moreover (if I am notdeceived) he resorteth oftentimes to you, being faire and comely ofperson, going alwayes in blacke garments of good price and value. Thisman, imagining (perhaps) no such minde in mee, as truely there is;hath often attempted mee, and never can I be at my doore, or window,but hee is alwayes present in my sight, which is not a littledispleasing to me; he watcheth my walks, and much I mervaile, thathe is not now heere.

　　Let me tell you holy Sir, that such behaviours doe many times laybad imputations upon very honest women, yet without any offence inthem. It hath often run in my mind, to let him have knowledgethereof my min by my brethren: but afterward I considered, that men(many times) deliver messages in such sort, as draw on very ungentleanswers, whereon grow words, and words beget actions. In which regard,because no harme or scandall should ensue, I thought it best to besilent; determining, to acquaint you rather therewith, then to anyother, as wel because you seem to be his friend, as also in regardof your office, which priviledgeth you to correct such abuses, notonely in friends, but also in strangers. Enow other women there are,(more is the pitty) who perhaps are better disposed to such suitesthen I am, and can both like and allow of such courting, otherwisethen I can doe; as being willing to embrace such offers, and (happily)loath to yeeld deniall. Wherefore, most humbly I entreate you goodFather (even for our blessed Ladies sake) that you would give him afriendly reprehension, and advise him to use such unmanly meanes nomore heereafter. With which words, she hung downe her bead in herbosome, cunningly dissembling, as if shee wept, wiping her eyes withher Handkerchife, when not a teare fel from them, but indeed weredry enough.

　　The holy Religious man, so soone as he heard her description ofthe man, presently knew whom shee meant, and highly commending theGentlewoman for her good and vertuous seeming disposition, beleevedfaithfully all that shee had said: promising her, to order thematter so well and discreetly, as shee should not any more beeoffended. And knowing her to be a woman of great wealth (after alltheir usuall manner, when they cast forth their fishing nets forgaine:) liberally he commeuned Almesdeeds, and dayly workes ofCharity, recounting to her beside his owne particular necessities.Then, giving him two peeces of Gold, she said: I pray you (goodFather) to be mindfull of me, and if he chance to make any deniall,tell him, that I spake it my selfe to you, and by the way of a sadcomplaint her confession being ended, and penance easie enoughenjoyned her, she promised to make her parents bountifullBenefactors to the Convent, and put more money into his hand, desiringhim in his Masses, to remember the soules of her deceased friends, andso returned home to her house.

　　Within a short while after her departure, the Gentleman, of whomeshe made this counterfeit complaint, came thither, as was his usuallmanner, and having done his duty to the holy Father, they sate downetogether privately, falling out of one discourse into another. Atthe length, the Friar (in very loving and friendly sort) mildlyreproved him for such amorous glaunces, and other pursuites, which (ashe thought) he dayly used to the Gentlewoman, according to her ownespeeches. The Gentleman mervalled greatly thereat, as one that hadnever seene her, and very sildome passed by the way where sheedwelt, which made him the bolder in his answeres; wherein theConfessour interrupting him, saide. Never make such admiration atthe matter, neyther waste more words in deniall, because they cannotserve thy turne; I tell thee plainely, I heard these words even fromher owne selfe, in a very sorowfull and sad complaint. And though(perhaps) heereafter, thou canst very hardly refraine such follies;yet let me tell thee so much of her (and under the seale of absoluteassurance) that she is the onely woman of the world, who to myjudgement, doth abhorre all such base behaviour. In regard thereforeof thine owne honour, as also not to vex and prejudice so vertuous aGentlewoman, I pray thee refraine such idlenesse henceforward, andsuffer her to live in peace.

　　The Gentleman being a little wiser then his ghostly Father,perceived immediately, the notable pollicy of the Woman. Whereupon,making somewhat bashfull appearance of any error already committed, hesaid; He would afterward be better advised. So departing from theFriar, hee went on directly, to passe by the house where theGentlewoman dwelt, and shee stood alwayes ready on her watch, at alittle Window, to observe when he would walke that way. And seeing himcomming, shee shewed her selfe so joyfull and gracious to him, as heeasily understood, whereto the substance of the holy Fathers chidingtended. And from that time forward, he used dayly though in covertmanner (to the no litle liking of the Gentlewoman and himselfe) tomake his passage thorough that street, under colour of someimportant occasions there concerning him.

　　Soone after, it being plainely discerned on either side, that theone was as well contented with these walkes, as the other could be:she desired to enflame him a little further, by a more liberallillustration of her affection towards him, when time and placeaffoorded convenient opportunity. To the holy Father againe shewent, (for she had beene too long from shrift) and kneeling downe athis feete, intended to begin her confession in teares; which the Friarperceiving, sorrowfully demanded of her; what accident had happened?Holy Father (quoth shee) no novell accident, only your wicked andungracious friend, by whom (since I was heere with you, yea, no longeragoe then yesterday) I have been so wronged, as I verily beleevethat he was borne to bee my mortall enemy, and to make me dosomthing to my utter disgrace for ever; and whereby I shall not dareto be seene any more of you my deare Father. How is this? answered theFriar, hath he not refrained from afflicting you so abusively?

　　Pausing a while, and breathing foorth many a dissembled sighe,thus shee replyed. No truely, holy Father, there is no likelyhood ofhis abstaining; for since I made my complaint to you, he belike takingit in evil part, to bee contraried in his wanton humours, hath(meerely in despight) walked seaven times in a day by my doore,whereas formerly he never used it above once or twice. And well wereit (good Father) if he could be contented with those walkes, andgazing glances which hee dartes at me: but growne he is so bolde andshamelesse, that even yesterday, (as I tolde you) hee sent a womanto me, one of his Pandoraes, as it appeared, and as if I had wantedeither Purses or Girdies, hee sent me by her, a Purse and a Girdle.Whereat I grew so greevously offended, as had it not bene for my duerespect and feare of God, and next the sacred reverence I beare to youmy ghostly Father, doubtlesse I had done some wicked deede.Neverthelesse, happily I withstood it, and wil neither say or do anything in this case, till first I have made it knowne to you.

　　Then I called to minde, that having redelivered the Purse and Girdleto his shee-Messenger, which brought them with lookes sufficient todeclare my discontentment: I called her backe againe, fearing leastshe would keep them to her selfe, and make him beleeve that I hadreceived them (as I have heard such kinde of women use to dosometimes) and in anger I snatcht them from her, and have brought themyou, to the end, that you may give him them againe; and tell him, Ihave no need of any such things, thankes be to heaven and myhusband, as no woman can be better stored then I am. Wherefore goodFather, purposely am I now come to you, to let him know, that if hewill not abstaine from thus molesting me, I will disclose it to myHusband, Father, and Brethren, whatsoever befall. For I had ratherhe should receive the injury, then I to be causelessly blamed for him;wherein good Father tell me, if I dooe not well. With manycounterfet sobbes, sighes, and teares these words were delivered;and drawing foorth from under her gowne, a very faire and richpurse, as also a Girdle of great worth, she threw them into the Friarslappe.

　　He verily beleeving all this false report, being troubled in hisminde thereat beyond measure, tooke the Gentlewoman by the hand,saying: Daughter, if thou be offended at these impudent follies,assuredly I cannot blame thee, nor will any wiseman reproove theefor it; and I commend thee for following my counsell. But let me alonefor schooling of my Gentleman, ill hath he kept his promise made tome; wherefore, in regard of his former offence, as also this otherso lately committed, I hope to set him in such heate, as shall makehim leave off from further injurying thee. Suffer not thy selfe tobe conquerd by choller, in disclosing this to thy kindred orhusband, because too much harme may ensue thereon. But feare not anywrong to thy selfe; for I am a true witnesse of thine honesty andvertue.

　　Now began she to seeme better comforted, and forbearing to play onthis string any longer, as well knowing the covetousnes of him and hisequals, she said: Holy Father, some few nights past, me thought inmy sleepe, that divers spirits of my kindred appeared to me in avision, who me thought were in very great pains, and desired nothingels but Almes; especially my Godmother, who seemed to be afflictedwith such extrem poverty, that it was most Pittifull to behold. AndI am halfe perswaded, that her torments are the greater, seeing metroubled with such an enemy to goodnesse. Wherefore (good Father) todeliver her soule and the others out of those fearfull flames, amongyour infinite other devout prayers, I would have you to say theforty Masses of S. Gregory, as a means for their happy deliverance,and so she put ten ducates into his hand. Which the holy man acceptedthankfully, and with good words, as also many singular examples,confirmed her bountifull devotion: and when he had given her hisbenediction, home she departed.

　　After that the Gentlewoman was gone, hee sent for his friend whomshe so much seemed to be troubled withall; and when he was come, heebeholding his Holy Father to looke discontentedly, thought, that nowhe should heare some newes from his Mistresse, and thereforeexpected what he would say. The Friar, falling into the course ofhis former reprehensions, but yet in more rough and impatientminner, sharpely checkt him for his immodest behaviour towards theGentlewoman, in sending her the Purse and Girdle. The Gentleman, whoas yet could not guesse whereto his speeches tended; somewhat coldlyand temperately, denied the sending of such tokens to her, to theend that he would not bee utterly discredited with the good man, if sobee the Gentlewoman had shewne him any such things. But then theFrier, waxing much more angry, sternly said. Bad man as thou art,how canst thou deny a manifest truth? See sir, these are none ofyour amorous tokens? No, I am sure you doe not know them, nor ever sawthem till now.

　　The Gentleman, seeming as if he were much ashamed, saide. TruelyFather I do know them, and confesse that I have done ill, and verygreatly offended: but now I will sweare unto you, seeing Iunderstand how firmely she is affected, that you shall never heare anymore complaint of me. Such were his vowes and protestations, as in theend the ghostly Father gave him both the Purse and Girdle: thenafter he had preached, and severely conjured him, never more to vexeher with any gifts at all, and he binding himselfe thereto by asolemne promise, he gave him license to depart. Now grew the Gentlemanvery jocond, being so surely certifyed of his Mistresses love, andby tokens of such worthy esteeme; wherefore no sooner was he gone fromthe Frier, but he went into such a secret place, where he could lether behold at her Window, what precious tokens he had received fromher, whereof she was extraordinarily joyfull, because her devices grewstill better and better; nothing now wanting, but her husbandsabsence, upon some journey from the City, for the full effecting ofher desire.

　　Within a few dayes after, such an occasion hapned, as her husband ofnecessity must journey to Geneway; and no sooner was he mounted onhorsebacke, taking leave of her and all his friends: but she, beingsure he was gone, went in all hast to her Ghostly Father; and, after afew faigned outward shewes, thus she spake. I must now plainely tellyou, holy Father, that I can no longer endure this wicked friend ofyours; but because I promised you the other day, that I would not doany thing, before I had your counsell therein, I am now come to tellyou, the just reason of my anger, and full purpose to avoid allfurther mollestation.

　　Your friend cannot terme him, but (questionlesse) a very divell ofhell: this morning, before the breake of day, having heard (but how, Iknow not) that my husband was ridden to Geneway: got over the wallinto my Garden, and climbing up a tree which standeth close beforemy Chamber window, when I was fast asleepe, opened the Casement, andwould have entred in at the window. But, by great good fortune, Iawaked, and made shew of an open outcry: but that he entreated me,both for Gods sake and yours, to pardon him this error, and neverafter he would presume any more to offend me. When he saw, that (foryour sake) I was silent, he closed fast the window againe, departed ashe came, and since I never saw him, or heard any tidings of him. NowJudge you, holy Father, whether these be honest courses or no, andto be endured by any civill Gentlewoman; neither would I sopatiently have suffered this, but onely in my dutifull reverence toyou.

　　The Ghostly Father hearing this, became the sorrowfullest man in theworld, not knowing how to make her any answere, but only demanded ofher divers times, whether she knew him so perfectly, that she didnot mistake him for some other? Quoth she, I would I did not knowhim from any other. Alas deere daughter (replied the Frier) what canmore be sayd in this case, but that it was over-much boldnesse, andvery ill done, and thou shewedst thy selfe a worthy wise woman, insending him away so mercifully, as thou didst. Once more I wouldentreat thee (deere and vertuous daughter) seeing grace hathhitherto kept thee from dishonor, and twice already thou hast creditedmy counsell, let me now advise thee this last time. Spare speech, orcomplaining to any other of thy friends, and leave-it to me, to try ifI can overcome this unchained divell, whom I tooke to be a much moreholy man. If I can recall him from this sensuall appetite, I shallaccount my labour well employed; but if I cannot do it, henceforward(with my blessed benediction) I give thee leave to do, even what thyheart will best tutor thee to. You see Sir (said shee) what mannerof man he is, yet would I not have you troubled or disobeyed, only Idesire to live without disturbance, which worke (I beseech you) asbest you may: for I promise you, good Father, never to solicite youmore uppon this occasion: And so, in a pretended rage, she returnedbacke from the ghostly Father.

　　Scarsely was she gone forth of the Church, but in commeth the manthat had (supposedly) so much transgressed; and the Fryer taking himaside, gave him the most injurious words that could be used to aman, calling him disloyall, perjured, and a traitor. He who hadformerly twice perceived, how high the holy mans anger mounted, didnothing but expect what he would say; and, like a man extreamlyperplexed, strove how to get it from him, saying; Holy Father, howcome you to be so heinously offended? What have I done to incenseyou so strangely? Heare me dishonest wretch answered the Frier, listenwhat I shall say unto thee. Thou answerest me, as if it were a yeareor two past, since so foule abuses were by thee committed, and theyalmost quite out of thy remembrance. But tell me wicked man; wherewast thou this morning, before breake of the day? Wheresoever I was,replyed the Gentleman, mee thinkes the tidings come very quickly toyou. It is true, said the Frier, they are speedily come to meindeed, and upon urgent necessity.

　　After a little curbing in of his wrath, somewhat in a milderstraine, thus he proceeded. Because the Gentlewomans husband isjourneyed to Geneway, proves this a ladder to your hope, that toembrace her in your armes, you must climbe over the Garden wall,like a treacherous robber in the night season, mount up a treebefore her Chamber window, open the Casement, as hoping to compassethat by importunity, which her spotlesse chastity will never permit.There is nothing in the world, that she can hate more then you, andpossibly yet you will love her whether [she] will or no. Manydemonstrations her selfe hath made to you, how retrograde you are toany good conceit of her, and my loving admonishments might have hadbetter successe in you, then as yet they shew of outward apparance.But one thing I must tell you, her silent sufferance of yourinjuries all this while, hath not bin in any respect of you, but at myearnest entreaties, and for my sake. But now she w be patient nolonger, and I have given her free license, if ever heereafter youoffer to attempt her any more, to make her complaint before herBrethren, which will redound to your no meane danger.

　　The Gentleman, having wisely collected his Love-lesson out of theHoly Fathers angry words, pacified the good old man so well as hecould with very solemne promises and protestations, that he shouldheare no more) any misbehaviour of his. And being gone from him,followed the instructions given in her complaint, by climbing over theGarden Wall, ascending the Tree, and entering at the Casement,standing ready open to welcome him. Thus the Friers simplicity,wrought on by her most ingenious subtiltie, made way to obtaine boththeir longing desires.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, WHAT CRAFT AND SUBTILTY SOME WILY WITS

　　CAN DEVISE, TO DECEIVE THE SIMPLE, AND COMPASSE THEIR OWNE

　　DESIRES.

　　A yong Scholler, named Felice, enstructed Puccio di Rinieri, howto become rich in a very short time. While Puccio made experience ofthe instructions taught him; Felice obtained the favour of hisDaughter.

　　After that Philomena had finished her Tale, she sate still; andDioneus (with faire and pleasing Language) commended theGentlewomans quaint cunning, but smiling at the Confessors witlessesimplicity. Then the Queene, turning with chearefull looks towardPamphilus, commaunded him to continue on their delight; who gladlyyeelded, and thus began. Madame, many men there are, who while theystrive to climbe from a good estate, to a seeming better; doe becomein much worse condition then they were before. As happened to aneighbour of ours, and no long time since, as the accident will betteracquaint you withall.

　　According as I have heard it reported, neere to Saint Brancazio,there dwelt an honest man, and some-what rich, who was called Pucciodi Rinieri, and who addicted all his paines and endeavours to Alchimy:wherefore, he kept no other family, but onely a widdowed daughter, anda servant; and because he had no other Art or exercise, he usedoften to frequent the market place. And in regard he was but a weakewitted man and a gourmand or grosse feeder; his language was themore harsh and rude; like to our common Porters or sottish men, andhis carriage also absurd, boore-like, and clownish. His daughter,being named Monna Isabetta, aged not above eight and twenty, or thirtyyeeres; was a fresh indifferent faire, plumpe, round woman, cherrycheekt, like a Queene-Apple; and, to please her Father, fed not sosparingly, as otherwise she would have done, but when she communedor jested with any body, she would talke of nothing, but onelyconcerning the great vertue in Alchimy, extolling it above all otherArts.

　　Much about this season of the yeare, there returned a young Schollerfrom Paris, named Felice, faire of complexion, comely of person,ingeniously witted and skilfully learned, who (soone after) grewinto familiarity, with Puccio: now because he could resolve him inmany doubts, depending on his profession of Alchimy, (himselfehaving onely practise, but no great learning) he used many questionsto him, shewed him very especiall matters of secrecy, entertaining himoften to dinners and suppers, whensoever he pleased to come andconverse with him; and his daughter likewise, perceiving with whatfavour her Father respected him, became the more familiar with him,allowing him good regard and reverence.

　　The young man continuing his resort to the House of Puccio, andobserving the widdow to be faire, fresh, and prettily formall; hebegan to consider with himselfe, what those things might be, whereinshe was most wanting; and (if he could) to save anothers labour,supply them by his best endeavours. Thus not alwayes carrying his eyesbefore him, but using many backe and circumspect regards, he proceededso farre in his wylie apprehensions, that (by a few sparkes close kepttogether) he kindled part of the same fire in her, which began toflame apparantly in him. And hee very wittily observing the same, asoccasion first smiled on him, and allowed him favourableopportunity, so did hee impart his intention to her.

　　Now albeit he found her plyant enough, to gaine physicke for herowne griefe, as soone as his; yet the meanes and manner were (asyet) quite out of all apprehension. For shee in no other part of theWorld, would trust her selfe in the young mans company, but onely inher Fathers house; and that was a place out of all possibility,because Puccio (by a long continued custome) used to watchwell-neere all the night, as commonly he did, each night afterother, never stirring foorth of the roomes, which much abated the edgeof the young mans appetite. After infinite intricate revolvings,wheeling about his busied braine, he thought it not altogether anHerculian taske, to enjoy his happinesse in the house, and without anysuspition, albeit Puccio kept still within doores, and watched ashee was wont to doe.

　　Upon a day as he sate in familiar conference with Puccio, he beganto speake unto him in this manner; I have many times noted, kindefriend Puccio, that all thy desire and endeavour is, by what meanesthou mayst become very rich, wherein (me thinkes) thou takest too widea course, when there is a much neerer and shorter way, which MighellScotus, and other his associates, very diligently observed andfollowed, yet were never willing to instruct other men therein;whereby the mysterie might bee drowned in oblivion, and prosecutedby none but onely great Lords, that are able to undergoe it. Butbecause thou art mine especiall friend, and I have received fromthee infinite kind favours; whereas I never intended, that any man (byme) should be acquainted with so rare a secret; if thou wilt imitatethe course as I shall shew thee, I purpose to teach it thee in fullperfection. Puccio being very earnestly desirous to understand thespeediest way to so singular a mysterie, first began to entreat him(with no meane instance) to acquaint him with the rules of so rich aScience; and afterward sware unto him, never to disclose it to anyperson, except hee gave his consent thereto; affirming beside, that itwas a rarity, not easie to bee comprehended by very apprehensivejudgements. Well (quoth Felice) seeing thou has: made me such asound and solemne promise, I will make it knowne unto thee.

　　Know then friend Puccio, the Philosophers do hold, that such ascovet to become rich indeed, must understand how to make the Stone: asI will tell thee how, but marke the manner very heedfully. I do notsay, that after the Stone is obtained, thou shalt bee even as richas now thou art; but thou shalt plainly perceive, that the verygrosest substances, which hitherto thou hast seene, all of them shalbemade pure golde: and such as afterward thou makest, shall be morecertaine, then to go or come with Aqua fortis, as now they do. Mostexpedient is it therefore, that when a man will go diligently aboutthis businesse, and purposeth to prosecute such a singular labour,which will and must continue for the space of 40 nights, he mustgive very carefull attendance, wholly abstaining from sleepe,slumbering, or so much as nodding all that while.

　　Moreover, in some apt and convenient place of thy house, theremust be a forge or furnace erected, framed in decent and formallfashion, and neere it a large table placed, ordered in such sort, asstanding upright on feete, and leaning the reines of thy backe againstit; thou must stande stedfastly in that manner every night, withoutthe least motion or stirring, untill the breake of day appeareth,and thine eyes still uppon the Furnace fixed, to keepe ever in memory,the true order which I have prescribed. So soone as the morning isseene, thou mayest (if thou wilt) walke, or rest a little upon thybed, and afterward go about thy businesse, if thou have any. Then goto dinner, attending readily till the evenings approch, preparing suchthings as I will readily set thee downe in writing, without whichthere is not any thing to bee done; and then returne to the same taskeagaine, not varying a jot from the course directed. Before the time befully expired, thou shalt perceive many apparant signes, that thestone is still in absolute forwardnesse, but it will bee utterlylost if thou fayle in the least of all the observances. And when theexperience hath crowned thy labour, thou art sure to have thePhilosophers stone, and thereby shalt be able to enrich all, and workewonders beside.

　　Puccio instantly replyed. Now trust me Sir, there is no greatdifficultie in this labour, neither doth it require anyextraordinary length of time: but it may very easily be followed andperformed, and (by your friendly favor, in helping to direct theFurnace and Table, according as you imagine most convenient) on Sundayat night next, I will begin my taske.The place which Puccio had chosen, for his hopefull attaining tothe Philosophers Stone, was close to the Chamber where his daughterlay having no other separation or division, but an old ruinoustottring wall. So that, when the Scholler was playing his prize,Puccio heard an unwonted noise in the house, which he had neverobserved before, neither knew the wall to have any such motion:wherefore, not daring to stirre from his standing, least all should bemarrd in the very beginning, he called to his daughter, demanding,what busle labour she was about? The widdow, being much addicted tofrumping according as questions were demanded of her, and (perhaps)forgetting who spake to her, pleasantly replied: Whoop Sir, whereare we now? Are the Spirits of Alchimy walking in the house, that wecannot lye quietly in our beds?

　　Pucclo mervalling at this answere, knowing she never gave him thelike before; demanded againe, what she did? The subtle wench,remembring that she had not answered as became her, said: Pardon meeFather, my wits were not mine owne, when you demanded such a sodainequestion; and I have heard you say an hundred times, that when folkego supperles to bed, either they walke in their sleepe, or beingawake, talke very idely, as (no doubt) you have discern'd by me. Naydaughter (quoth he) it may be, that I was in a waking dreame, andthought I heard the olde wall totter: but I see I was deceived, for noit is quiet and still enough. Talke no more good Father, saide she,least you stirre from your place, and hinder your labour: take no carefor mee, I am able enough to have care of my selfe.

　　To prevent any more of these nightly disturbances, they went tolodge in another part of the house, where they continued out thetime of Puccioes paines, with equall contentment to them both, whichmade her divers times say to Felice: You teach my father the cheefegrounds of Alchimy, while we helpe to waste away his treasure. Thusthe Scholler being but poore, yet well forwarded in Learning, made useof Puccioes folly, and found benefit thereby, to keepe him out ofwants, which is the bane and overthrow of numberlesse good wits. AndPuccio dying, before the date of his limited time, because he failedof the Philosophers Stone, Isabetta joyned in marriage with Felice, tomake him amends for instructing her father, by which meanes he came tobe her husband.

　　THE THIRD DAY THE FIFTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DESCRIBED THE FRAILETY OF SOME WOMEN, AND FOLLY OF

　　SUCH HUSBANDS, AS LEAVE THEM ALONE TO THEIR OWNE DISPOSITION

　　Ricciardo surnamed the Magnifico, gave a Horse to SigniorFrancesco Vergillisi, on condition that he might speake to his wife inhis presence; which he did, and she not returning him any answer, madeanswer to himselfe on her behalfe, and according to his answer, so theeffect followed.

　　Pamphilus having ended his novell of Puccio the Alchimist, theQueene fixing her eye on Madam Eliza, gave order, that shee shouldsucceed. She looking somewhat more austerely then any of the restnot in any spleen, but as it was her usuall manner, thus began. Theworld containeth some particular people, who beleeve (because theyknow something) that others are ignorant in all things, who for themost part, while they intend to make a scorne of other men, upontriall, finde themselves to carry away the scorne. Therefore, Iaccount it no meane folly in them, who (upon no occasion) wil temptthe power of another mans wit or experience. But because all men andwomen are not of my opinion; I meane that you shall perceive it moreapparantly, by an accident happening to a Knight of Pistoia, as youshall heare by me related.

　　In the Town of Pistoia, bordering upon Florence, there lived notlong since, a Knight named Signieur Francesco, descended of the linageor family of the Vergellisi, a man very rich, wise, and in many thingsprovident, but gripple, covetous, and too close handed, withoutrespect to his worth and reputation. He being called to the Officeof Podesta in the City of Millaine, furnished himselfe with all things(in honourable manner) beseeming such a charge; onely, a comelyhorse for his owne saddle excepted, which he knew not by any meaneshow to compasse, so loath hee was lay out money, albeit his creditmuch depended thereon.

　　At the same time, there lived in Pistoya likewise, a young man,named Ricciardo, derived of meane birth, but very wealthy, quickewitted, and of commendable person, alwayes going so neate, fine, andformall in his apparrell, that he was generally tearmed the Magnifico,who had long time affected, yea, and closely courted, (though anyadvantage or successe) the Lady and wife of Signior Francesco, who wasvery beautifull, vertuous, and chaste. It so chanced, that thisMagnifico had the very choisest and goodliest ambling Gelding in allTuscany, which hee loved dearely, for his faire forme, and othergood parts. Upon a flying rumor throughout Pistoia, that he daily madelove to the foresaid Ladie, some busie-body put it into the head ofSignior Francesco, that if he pleased to request the Gelding, theMagnifico would frankely give it him, in regard of the love he bare tohis wife.

　　The base-minded Knight, coveting to have the Horse, and yet not topart with any money, sent for the Magnifico, desiring to buy his fayreGelding of him, because he hoped to have him of free gift. TheMagnifico hearing this request, was very joyfull, and thus answered;Sir, if you would give me all the wealth which you possesse in thisworld, I wil not sell you my horse, rather I wil bestow him on youas a Gentlemans gift: but yet upon this condition, that before youhave him delivered, I may with your license, and in your presencespeake a few words to your vertuous Ladie, and so farre off indistance from you, as I may not be heard by any, but onely herselfe. Signior Francesco, wholly conducted by his base avariciousdesire, and meaning to make a scorne at the Magnifico, made answer,that he was well contented to let him speak with her when he would;and leaving him in the great Hall of the house, went to his wivesChamber, and told her how easily he might enjoy the horse,commanding her forthwith to come and heare what he could say to her,only she should abstaine, and not returne him any answer. The Ladywith a modest blush, much condemned this folly in him, that hiscovetousnes should serve as a cloake to cover any unfitting speecheswhich her chaste eares could never endure to heare. Neverthelessebeing to obey her husbands will, she promised to do it, and followedhim down into the Hall, to heare what the Magnifico would say.Againe he there confirmed the bargaine made with her husband, andsitting downe by her in a corner of the Hall, farre enough off fromany ones hearing, taking her curteously by the hand, thus he spake.

　　Worthy Lady, it seemeth to me, that you are so truly wise, as nodoubt you have long since perceived, what unfeigned affection yourbeauty (far excelling) hath compelled me to beare you. Setting asidethose commendable qualities and singular vertues gloriously shining inyou, and powerfull enough to make a conquest of the stoutestcourage, I held it utterly needlesse, to let you understand bywords, how faithfull the love is I bear you, were it not much morefervent and constant, then ever any other man can expresse to a woman.In which condition it shall still continue, without the leastblemish or impayre, so long as I enjoy life or motion; yea, and I dareassure you, that if in the future world, affection may containe thesame powerfull dominion, as it doth in this; I am the man borne tolove you perpetually. Whereby you may rest confidently perswaded, thatyou enjoy not any thing, how poore or precious soever it be, which youcan so solemnely account to be your owne, and in the truest title ofright, as you may my selfe, in all that I have, or for ever shall bemine.

　　To confirme your opinion in this case by any argument of greaterpower, let me tell you, that I should repute it as my fairest and mostgracious fortune, if you would command me some such service, asconsisteth in mine ability to performe, and in your courteous favourto accept, yea, if it were thorow the whole world, right to travalam I, and obedient. In which regard faire Madam, if I be so much,yours, as you heare I am, I may boldly adventure (and not without goodreason) to acquaint your chaste eares with my earnest desires, foron you onely depends my happinesse, life, and absolute comfort, and asyour most humble servant, I beseech you (my deerest good, and solehope of my soule) that rigour may dwell no longer in your gentlebrest, but Lady-like pitty and compassion, whereby I shall say, thatas your divine beauty enflamed mine affections, even so it extendedsuch a merciful qualification, is exceeded all my hope, but not thehalfe part of your pitty.

　　Admit (myracle of Ladies) that I should die in this distresse: Alas,my death would be but your dishonour; I cannot be termed mine ownemurtherer, when the Dart came from your eye that did it, and mustremaine a witnes of your rigor. You cannot then chuse but call tominde, and say within your own soule: Alas, what a sinne have Icommitted, in being so unmercifull to my Magnifico. Repentance thenserves to no purpose, but you must answer for such unkinde cruelty.Wherefore, to prevent so blacke a scandall to your bright beauty,beside the ceaselesse acclamations, which will dog your walkes inthe day time, and breake your quiet sleepes in the night season,with fearefull sights and gastly apparitions, hovering and hauntingabout your bed; let all these moove you to milde mercy, and spillnot life, when you may save it.

　　So the Magnifico ceasing, with teares streaming from his eyes, andsighes breaking from his heart, hee sate still in expectation of theLadies answere, who made neither long or short of the matter,neither Tilts nor Tourneying, nor many lost mornings and evenings, norinfinite other such like Offices, which the Magnifico (for her sake)from time to time had spent in vaine, without the least shew ofacceptation, or any hope at all to winne her love: mooved now inthis very houre, by these solemne is protestations, or rather mostprevailing asseverations, she began to finde that in her, which(before) she never felt, namely Love. And although (to keepe herpromise made to her husband) shee spake not a word: yet her heartheaving, her soule throbbing, sighes intermixing, and complexionaltering, could not hide her intended answer to the Magnifico, ifpromise had beene no hinderance to her will. All this while theMagnifico sate as mute as she, and seeing she would not give him anyanswere at all, he could not choose but wonder thereat, yet atlength perceived, that it was thus cunningly contrived by her husband.Notwithstanding, observing well her countenance, that it was in aquite contrary temper, another kinde of fire sparkling in her eye,other humours flowing, her pulses strongly beating, her stomackerising, and sighes swelling, all these were arguments of a change, andmotives to advance his hope. Taking courage by this ticklishperswasion, and instructing his mind with a new kinde of counsell;he would needes answer himselfe on her behalfe, and as if she haduttered the words, thus he spake.

　　Magnifico, and my friend, surely it is a long time since, when Ifirst noted thine affection toward me to be very great and mostperfect, but now I am much more certain thereof, by thine ownehonest and gentle speeches, which content me as they ought to do.Neverthelesse, if heretofore I have seemed cruell and unkinde to thee,I would not have thee thinke, that my heart was any way guilty of myoutward severity, but did evermore love thee, and held thee deererthen any man living. But yet it became me to do so, as well in feareof others, as for the renowne of mine owne reputation. But now isthe time at hand, to let thee knowe more clearly, whether I doaffect thee or no: as a just guerdon of thy constant lovewhich long thou hast, and still doest beare to me. Wherefore,comfort thy selfe, and dwell on this undoubted hope, because SigniorFrancesco my husband, is to be absent hence for many dayes, beeingchosen Podesta at Millaine, as thou canst not choose but heare, for itis common through the Country.

　　I know (for my sake) thou hast given him thy goodly ambling Gelding,and so soone as he is gone, I promise thee upon my word, and by thefaithfull love I beare thee; that I will have further conferencewith thee, and let thee understand somewhat more of my minde. Andbecause this is neither fitting time nor place, to discourse onmatters of such serious moment: observe heereafter, as a signall, whenthou seest my Crimson Skarfe hanging in the window of my Chamber,which is upon the Garden side, that evening (so soone as it isnight) come to the Garden gate, with wary respect that no eye dodiscover thee, and there thou shalt finde me walking, and ready toacquaint thee with other matters, according as I shall finde occasion.

　　When the Magnifico in the person of the Lady, had spoken thus,then he returned her this answer. Most vertuous Lady, my spirits areso transported with extraordinary joy, for this your gracious andwelcome answer, that my sences faile me, and all my faculties quiteforsake me, that I cannot give you such thankes as I would. And if Icould speak equally to my desire, yet the season suites not therewith,neither were it convenient that I should be so troublesome to you. Letme therefore humbly beseech you, that the desire I have toaccomplish your will (which wordes availe not to expresse) may remainein your kinde consideration. And as you have commanded me, so will Inot faile to performe it accordingly, and in more thankfull manner,then (as yet) I am able to let you know. Now there resteth nothingelse to do, but under the protection of your gracious pardon, I togive over speech, and you to attend your woorthy Husband.

　　Notwithstanding all that hee had spoken, yet shee replyed not oneword; wherefore the Magnifico arose, and returned to the Knight, whowent to meete him, saying in a lowd laughter. How now man? Have Inot kept my promise with thee? No Sir, answered the Magnifico, for youpromised I should speake with your wife, and you have made mee talketo a marble Statue. This answere, was greatly pleasing to theKnight, who, although hee had an undoubted opinion of his wife; yetthis did much more strengthen his beliefe, and hee said. Now thouconfessest thy Gelding to bee mine? I doe, replied the Magnifico,but if I had thought, that no better successe would have ensued on thebargaine; without your motion for the horse, I would have given himyou: and I am sorie that I did not, because now you have bought myhorse, and yet I have not sold him. The Knight laughed heartily atthis answer, and being thus provided of so faire a beast, hee rodeon his journey to Millaine, and there entred into his authority ofPodesta.

　　The Lady remained now in liberty at home, considering on theMagnificoes words, and likewise the Gelding, which (for her sake)was given to her husband. Oftentimes shee saw him passe too and frobefore her windowe, still looking when the Flagge of defiance shouldbe hanged forth, that hee might fight valiantly under her Colours. TheStory saith, that among many of her much better meditations, sheewas heard to talke thus idely to her selfe. What doe I meane?Wherefore is my youth? The olde miserable man is gone to Millaine, andGod knoweth when hee comes backe againe, ever, or never. Is dignitypreferred before wedlockes holy duty, and pleasures abroade, more thencomforts at home? Ill can age pay youths arrerages, when: time isspent, and no hope sparde. Actions omitted, are oftentimes repented,but done in due season, they are sildome sorrowed for. Upon theseun-Lady-like private consultations, whether the window shewed thesigna or no; it is no matter belonging to my charge: I say, husbandsare unwise, to graunt such ill advantages, and wives much worse, ifthey take hold of them, onely Judge you the best, and so the Tale isended.

　　THE THIRD DAY THE SIXTH NOVELL

　　DECLARING, HOW MUCH PERSEVERANCE, AND A COURAGIOUS SPIRIT IS

　　AVAILABLE IN LOVE

　　Ricciardo Minutolo fell in love with the wife of PhilippelloFighinolfi, and knowing her to be very jealous of her Husband, gaveher to understand, that hee was greatly enamoured of his Wife, and hadappointed to meete her privately in a Bathing house, on the next dayfollowing: where shee hoping to take him tardie with his closecompacted Mistresse, found her selfe to be deceived by the saidRicciardo.

　　No more remained to be spoken by Madame Eliza, but the cunning ofthe Magnifico, being much commended by all the company: the Queenecommanded Madame Fiammetta, to succede next in order with one of herNovels, who (smiling) made answer that shee would, and began thus.Gracious Ladies, mee thinkes wee have spoken enough already,concerning our owne Citie, which as it aboundeth copiously in allcommodities, so is it an example also to every convenient purpose. Andas Madam Eliza hath done, by recounting occasions happening in anotherWorld, so must we now leape a little further off, even so far asNaples, to see how one of those Saint-like Dames that nicely seemes toshun loves allurings, was guided by the good spirit to a friend ofhers, and tasted of the fruite, before she knew the flowers. Asufficient warning for you to apprehend before hand what may followafter, and to let you see beside, that when an error is committed, howto bee discreete in keeping it from publike knowledge.

　　In the Citie of Naples, it being of great antiquity, and (perhaps)as pleasantly situated, as any other City in all Italy, there dweltsometime a yong Gentleman, of noble parentage, and well knowne tobee wealthy, named Ricciardo Minutolo, who although hee had aGentlewoman of excellent beuty, and worthy the verie kindest affectingto his wife; yet his gadding eye gazed elsewhere, and he becameenamored of another, which (in generall opinion) surpassed all theNeapolitane Women else, in feature, favour, and the choysestperfections, shee being named Madam Catulla wife to as gallant a youngGentleman, called Philippello Fighinolfi, who most dearly he lovedbeyond all other, for her vertue and admired chastity.

　　Ricciardo loving this Madam Catulla, and using all such meanswhereby the grace and liking of a Lady might be obtained; found it yeta matter beyond possibility, to compasse the height of his desire:so that many desperate and dangerous resolutions beleagred his braine,seeming so intricate and unlikely to affoord any hopefull yssue, ashee wished for nothing more then death.

　　And death (as yet) being deafe to all his earnest imprecations,delayed him on in lingering afflictions: and continuing still insuch an extreame condition, he was advised by some of his bestfriends, utterly to abstaine from this fond pursuit, because his hopeswere meerely in vaine, and Madam Catulla prized nothing moreprecious to her in the World, then unstayned loyaltie to herHusband: and yet shee lived in such extreame jealousie of him, asfearing least some bird flying in the ayre should snatch him from her.

　　Ricciardo not unacquainted with this her jealous humour, as wellby credible hearing thereof, as also by daily observation, began towith himselfe, that it were best to consider for him, to dissembleamorous affection in some other place, and (henceforward) to set asideall hope, of ever enjoying the love of Madam Catulla, because he wasnow become the servant to another Gentlewoman, pretending (in herhonour) to performe many worthy actions of Armes, Joustes,Tournaments, and all such like noble exercises, as he was wont todoe for Madam Catulla. So that most of the people of Naples, butespecially Madam Catulla, becam perswaded, that his formerfruitlesse love to her was quite changed, and the new elected Lady hadall the glory of his best endevours, persevering so long in thisopinion, as now it passed absolutely for currant. Thus seemed he nowas meere a stranger to her, whose house before he familiarlyfrequented, yet as a neighbour gave her the daies salutations,according as he chanced to see her, or meet her.

　　It came so to passe, that it being now the delightfull Summerseason, when all Gentlemen and Gentlewomen used to meete together(according to a custome long observed in that Country) sportingalong on the Sea Coast, dining and supping there very often, RicciardoMinutolo happened to heare, that Madam Catulla (with a company ofher friends) intended also to be present there among them; at whichtime, consorted with a seemely traine of his confederates, he resortedthither, and was graciously welcommed by Madam Catulla, where hepretended no willing long time of tarrying, but that Catulla and theother Ladies were faine to entreate him, discoursing of his love tohis new elected Mistresse: which Minutolo graced with so solemne acountenance, as it ministred much more matter of conference, allcoveting to know what she was.

　　So farre they walked, and held on this kinde of discoursing, asevery Lady and Gentlewoman, waxing weary of too long a continuedargument, began to separate her selfe with such an associate as sheebest liked, and as in such walking women are wont to doe; so thatMadam Catulla having few females left with her, stayed behind withMinutolo, who sodainly shot forth a word concerning her husbandPhilipello, and of his loving another woman beside her selfe. She thatwas overmuch jealous before, became so sodainely set on fire to knowwhat shee was of whom Minutolo spake, as she sat silent a longwhile, til being able to containe no longer, shee entreatedRicciardo even for the Ladies sake, whose love he had so devoutlyembraced, to resolve her certainly in this strange alteration of herhusband; whereunto thus he answered.

　　Madam, you have so straitly concured me, by urging the remembranceof her; for whose sake I am not able to deny any thing you can demand,as I am readie therein to pleasure you. But first you must promise me,that neither you, or any other person for you, shall at any timedisclose it to your Husband, untill you have seene by effect, thatwhich I have told you proveth to be true: and when you please, I wilinstruct you how your selfe shall see it. The Ladie was not a littlejoyfull to be thus satisfied in her Husbands folly, and constantlycrediting his words to be true, shee sware a solemne oath, that no onealive should ever know it. So stepping a little further aside, becauseno listening eare should heare him, thus he beganne.

　　Lady, if I did love you now so effectually as heeretofore I havedone, I should be very circumspect, in uttering any thing which Iimmagined might distast you. I know not whether your husbandPhilipello, were at any time offended, because I affected you, orbeleeved that I received any kindnes from you: but whether it wereso or no, I could never discerne it by any outward apparance. Butnow awaiting for the opportunity of time, which he conceived shouldaffoord me the least suspition, he seekes to compasse that, which (Idoubt) he feares I would have done to him, in plaine termes Madam,to have his pleasure of my wife. And as by some carriages I haveobserved, within few daies past he hath solicited and pursued hispurpose very secretly, by many Ambassages, and meanes, as (indeed) Ihave learned from her selfe, and alwaies she hath returned in suchanswers, as she receyved by my direction.

　　And no longer ago Madam, then this very morning, before my comminghither, I found a woman-messenger in my house, in very closeconference with my Wife, when growing doubtfull of that which was trueindeede, I called my Wife, enquiring, what the woman would have withher; and she told me, it was another pursuite of PhilipelloFighinolfi, who (quoth shee) upon such answers as you have caused meto send him from time to time, perhappes doth gather some hope ofprevailing in the end, which maketh him still to importune me as hedoth. And now he adventureth so farre, as to understand my finallintention, having thus ordered his complot, that when I please, I mustmeet him secretly in a house of this City, where he hath prepared aBath ready for me, and hopeth to enjoy the end of his desire, asvery earnestly he hath solicited me thereto. But if you had notcommanded me, to hold him in suspense with so many frivolousanswers, I would ere this, have sent him such a message, as shouldhave bene little to his liking.

　　With patience Madam I endured all before, but now (me thinkes) heproceedeth too farre, which is not any way to be suffered; andtherefore I intended to let you know it, that you may perceive, howwel you are rewarded for the faithfull and loyall love you bearehim, and for which, I was even at deaths dore. Now, because you may bethe surer of my speeches, not to be any lyes or fables, and that youmay (if you please) approve the truth by your owne experience, Icaused my wife to send him word, that she would meet him to morrowat the Bathing-house appointed, about the houre of noone-day, whenpeople repose themselves in regard of the heates violence; withwhich answer the woman returned very jocondly. Let me now tell youLady, I hope you have better opinion of my wit, then any meaning inme, to send my wife thither; I rather did it to this end, thathaving acquainted you with his treacherous intent, you should supplymy wives place, by saving both his reputation and your owne, andfrustrating his unkind purpose to me. Moreover, upon the view of hisowne delusion, wrought by my wife in meere love to you, he shall seehis foule shame, and your most noble care, to keepe the rites ofmarriage betweene you still unstained.

　　Madame Catulla, having heard this long and unpleasing report,without any consideration, either what he was that tolde the tale,or what a treason he intended against her: immediately (as jealouspersons use to doe) she gave faith to his forgerie, and began todiscourse many things to him, which imagination had often misguidedher in, against her honest minded husband, and enflamed with rage,suddenly replied; that shee would doe according as he had advised her,as being a matter of no difficulty. But if he came, she would so shameand dishonour him, as no woman whatsoever should better schoole him.Ricciardo highly pleased herewith, and being perswaded, that hispurpose would take the full effect: confirmed the Lady in herdetermination with many words more; yet putting her in memory, tokeepe her faithfull promise made, without revealing the matter toany living person, as shee had sworne upon her faith.

　　On the morrow morning, Ricciardo went to an auncient woman of hisacquaintance, who was the Mistresse of a Bathing-house, and therewhere he had appointed Madame Catulla, that the Bath should beeprepared for her, giving her to understand the whole businesse, anddesiring her to be favourable therein to him. The woman, who had beenemuch beholding to him in other matters, promised very willingly tofulfill his request, concluding with him, both what should be done andsaid. She had in her house a very darke Chamber, without any window toaffoord it the least light, which Chamber she had made ready,according to Ricciardoes direction, with a rich Bed thereir, so softand delicate as possible could bee, wherein he entred so soone as hehad dined, to attend the arrivall of Madame Catulla. On the sameday, as she had heard the speeches of Ricciardo, and gave morecredit to them then became her; shee returned home to her house inwonderfull impatience. And Philippello her husband came homediscontentedly too, whose head being busied about some worldlyaffaires, perhaps he looked not so pleasantly, neither used her sokindly, as he was wont to doe. Which Catulla perceiving, shee wasten times more suspicious then before, saying to her selfe. Nowapparent trueth doth disclose it selfe, my husbands head is troublednow with nothing else, but Ricciardoes wife, with whom (to morrow)he purposeth his meeting; wherein he shall be disappointed, if I live;taking no rest at all the whole night, for thinking how to handleher husband.

　　What shall I say more? On the morrow, at the houre of mid-dayaccompanied onely with her Chamber-mayde, and without any otheralteration in opinion; shee went to the house where the Bath waspromised, and meeting there with the olde woman, demaunded of her,if Philippello were come thither as yet or no? The woman, being wellinstructed by Ricciardo, answered: Are you shee that should meetehim heere? Yes, replied Catulla. Goe in then to him (quoth thewoman) for he is not farre off before you.

　　Madame Catulla, who went to seeke that which shee would not finde,being brought vailed into the darke Chamber where Ricciardo was,entred into the Bath, hoping to finde none other there but herhusband, and the custome of the Country, never disallowed suchmeetings of men with their wives, but held them to be good andcommendable. In a counterfeit voyce he bad her welcome, and she, notseeming to be any other then shee was indeed, entertained hisimbracings in as loving manner; yet not daring to speake, least heshould know her, but suffered him to proceede in his owne errour.

　　Let passe the wanton follies passing betweene them, and come toMadame Catulla, who finding it a fit and convenient time, to ventforth the tempest of her spleene, began in this manner. Alas! howmighty, are the misfortunes of women, and how ill requited is allthe loyall love of many wives to their husbands? I, a pooremiserable Lady, who, for the space of eight yeeres now fullycompleated, have loved thee: more dearely then mine owne life, findenow (to my hearts endlesse griefe) how thou wastest and consumestthy desires, to delight them with a strange woman, like a most vileand wicked man as thou art. With whom doest thou now imagine thy selfeto be? Thou art with her, whom thou hast long time deluded by falseblandishments, feigning to affect her, when thou doatest in thydesires else-where. I am thine owne Catulla, and not the wife ofRicciardo, trayterous and unfaithfull man, as thou art. I am sure thouknowest my voyce, and I thinke it a thousand yeeres, until wee may seeeach other in the light, to doe thee such dishonour as thou justlydeservest, dogged, disdainfull, and villainous wretch. By conceivingto have another woman in thy wanton embraces thou hast declared morejoviall disposition, and demonstrations of farre greater kindnesse,then domesticke familiarity. At home thou lookest sower, sullen orsurly, often froward, and seldome well pleased. But the best is,whereas thou intendest this husbandrie for another mans ground, thouhast (against thy will) bestowed it on thine owne, and the waterhath runne a contrary course, quite from the current where thoumeantst it.

　　What answer canst thou make, devill, and no man? What, have my wordssmitten thee dumbe? Thou mayest (with shame enough) hold thy peace,for with the face of a man, and love of an husband to his wife, thouart not able to make any answere.

　　Ricciardo durst not speake one word, but still expressed his affablebehaviour towards her, bestowing infinite embraces and kisses onher: which so much the more augmented her rage and anger, continuingon her chiding thus. If by these flatteries and idle follies, thouhopest to comfort or pacifie me, thou runnest quite by as from thyreckoning; for I shall never imagine my selfe halfe satisfied,untill in the presence of my parents, friends, and neighbours, Ihave revealed thy base behaviour. Tell mee, treacherous man, am notI as faire, as the wife of Ricciardo? Am I not as good a Gentlewomanborne, as shee is? What canst thou more respect in her, then is inmee? Villaine, monster, why doest thou not answere mee? I will send toRicciardo, who loveth mee beyond all other women in Naples, and yetcould never vaunt, that I gave him so much as a friendly looke: heshall know, what a dishonour thou hadst intended towards him; whichboth he and his friends will revenge soundly upon thee. Theexclamations of the Lady were so tedious and irksome, that Ricciardoperceiving, if shee continued longer in these complaints, worsewould ensue thereon, then could bee easily remedied: resolved tomake himselfe knowne unto her, to reclaime her out of this violentextasie, and holding her somewhat strictly, to prevent her escapingfrom him, he said. Madam, afflict your selfe no further, for, what Icould not obtaine by simply loving you, subtilty hath better taughtme, and I am your Ricciardo: which she hearing, and perfectlyknowing him by his voyce; shee would have leapt out of the Bath, butshee could not, and to avoyde her crying out, he layde his hand on hermouth, saying. Lady, what is done, cannot now be undone, albeit youcried out all your life time. If you exclaime, or make this knowneopenly by any meanes; two unavoydable dangers must needes ensuethereon. The one (which you ought more carefully to respect) is thewounding of your good renowne and honour, because, when you shall say,that by treacherie I drew you hither: I will boldly maintaine thecontrary, avouching, that having corrupted you with gold, and notgiving you so much as covetously you desired; you grew offended, andthereon made the outcry, and you are not to learne, that the worldis more easily induced to beleeve the worst, then any goodnesse, be itnever so manifest. Next unto this, mortall hatred must arisebetweene your husband and mee, and (perhaps) I shall as soone killhim, as he me; whereby you can hardly, live in any true contentmentafter. Wherefore, joy of my life, doe not in one moment, both shameyour selfe, and cause such perill betweene your husband and me: foryou are not the first, neither can be the last, that shall bedeceived. I have not beguiled you, to take any honour from you, butonely declared, the faithfull affection I beare you, and so shalldoe for ever, as being your bounden and most obedient servant; andas it is a long time agoe, since I dedicated my selfe and all mineto your service, so hence-forth must I remaine for ever. You arewise enough (I know) in all other things: then shew your selfe notto be silly or simple in this.

　　Ricciardo uttered these words, teares streaming aboundantly downehis cheekes, and Madame Catulla (all the while) likewise showred forthher sorrowes equally to his, now, although she was exceedinglytroubled in mind, and saw what her owne jealous folly had nowbrought her to, a shame beyond all other whatsoever: in the middest ofher tormenting passions, shee considered on the words of Ricciardo,found good reason in them, in regard of the unavoydable evilswhereupon shee thus spake. Ricciardo, I know not how to beare thehorrible injurie, and notorious treason used by thee against me, graceand goodnesse having so forsaken me, to let me fall in so foule amanner. Nor becommeth it me, to make any noyse or out-cry heere,whereto simplicity, or rather devillish jealousie, did conduct me. Butcertaine I am of one thing, that I shall never see any one joyfullday, till (by one meanes or other) I bee reverged on thee. Thou hastglutted thy desire with my disgrace, let me therefore go from thee,never more to looke upon my wronged husband, or let any honest womanever see my face.

　　Ricciardo perceiving the extremity of her perplexed minde, usedall manly and milde perswasions, which possibly he could devise todoe, to turne the torrent of this high tide, to a calmer course; as byoutward shew shee made appearance of, untill (in frightfull fearesshunning every one shee met withall, as arguments of herguiltinesse) shee recovered her owne house, where remorse sotortured her distressed soule, that she fell into so fierce amelancholy, as never left her till shee died. Upon the report whereof,Ricciardo becomming likewise a widdower, and grievingextraordinarily for his haynous transgression, penitently betookehimselfe to live in a wildernesse, where (not long after) he ended hisdayes.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE SEAVENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS SIGNIFIED THE POWER OF LOVE, AND THE DIVERSITY OF

　　DANGERS, WHEREINTO MEN MAY DAYLY FALL.

　　Theobaldo Elisei, having received an unkinde repulse by his beloved,departed from Florence, and returning thither (a long while after)in the habite of a Pilgrime; he spake with her, and made his wrongsknowne unto her. He delivered her Father from the danger of death,because it was proved, that he had slaine Theobaldo: he made peacewith his brethren, and in the end, wisely enjoyed his hearts desire.

　　So ceased Fiammetta her discourse, being generally commended, whenthe Queene, to prevent the losse of time, commanded Aemillia to follownext, who thus began. It liketh me best (gracious Ladies) to returnehome againe to our owne City, which it pleased the for.

　　mer two discoursers to part from: And there I will shew you, how aCitizen of ours, recovered the kindnesse of his Love, after hee hadlost it.

　　Sometime there dwelt in Florence a young Gentleman, namedTheobaido Elisei, descended of a noble House, who became earnestlyenamoured of a Widdow, called Hermelina, the daughter toAldobrandino Palermini: well deserving, for his vertues andcommendable qualities, to enjoy of her whatsoever he could desire.Secretly they were espoused together, but Fortune, the enemy to Loversfelicities, opposed her malice against them, in depriving Theobaldo ofthose deere delights, which sometime he held in free possession, andmaking him as a stranger to her gracious favours. Now grew sheecontemptibly to despise him, not onely denying to heare any messagesent from him, but scorning also to vouch safe so much as a sight ofhim, causing in him extreme griefe and melancholy, yet concealling allher unkindnesse so wisely to himselfe, as no one could understandthe reason of his sadnesse.

　　After he had laboured by all hopefull courses, to obtaine thatfavour of her, which he had formerly lost, without any offence in him,as his innocent soule truly witnessed with him, and saw that all hisfurther endeavours were fruitlesse and in vaine; he concluded toretreate himselfe from the World, and not to be any longer irkesome inher eye, that was the onely occasion of his unhappinesse. Hereupon,storing himselfe with summes of money, as suddenly he could collecttogether, secretly he departed from Florence, without speaking anyword to his friends or kindred; except one kinde companion ofhis, whom he acquainted with most of his secrets, and so travelledto Ancona, where he termed himselfe by the name of Sandoloscio.Repairing to a wealthy Merchant there, he placed himselfe as hisservant, and went in a Ship of his with him to Cyprus; his actions andbehaviour proved so pleasing to the Merchant, as not onely heallowed him very sufficient wages, but also grew into such associationwith him; as he gave the most of his affaires into his hands, which heguided with such honest and discreete care, that hee himselfe (infew yeeres compasse) proved to be a rich Merchant, and of famousreport.

　　While matters went on in this successefull manner, although he couldnot chuse, but still he remembred his cruell Mistresse, and was verydesperately transported for her love, as coveting (above all thingselse) to see her once more; yet was he of such powerfull constancy, as7 whole yeeres together, he vanquished all those fierce conflicts. Buton a day it chanced he heard a song sung in Cyprus, which hehimselfe had formerly made, in honour of the love he bare to hisMistresse, and what delight he conceived, by being dayly in herpresence; whereby he gathered, that it was impossible for him toforget her, and proceeded on so desirously, as he could not live,except he had a sight of her once more, and therefore determined onhis returne to Florence. Having set all his affaires in due order,accompanied with a servant of his onely, he passed to Ancona, wherewhen he was arrived, he sent his Merchandises to Florence, in nameof the Merchant of Ancona, who was his especiall friend and partner;travayling himselfe alone with his servant, in the habite of aPilgrime, as if he had beene newly returned from Jerusalem.

　　Being come to Florence, he went to an Inne kept by two brethren,neere neighbours to the dwelling of his Mistresse, and the first thinghe did, was passing by her doore, to get a sight of her if he wereso happie. But he found the windowes, doores, and all parts of thehouse fast shut up, whereby he suspected her to be dead, or else to bechanged from her dwelling: wherefore (much perplexed in minde) he wenton to the two brothers Inne, finding foure persons standing at thegate, attired in mourning, whereat he marvelled not a little;knowing himselfe to be so transfigured, both in body and babite, farrefrom the manner of common use at his parting thence, as it was adifficult matter to know him: he stept boldly to a Shooe-makers shopneere adjoyning, and demanded the reason of their wearing mourning.The Shooe-maker made answer thus; Sir, those men are clad in mourning,because a brother of theirs, being named Theobaldo (who hath beeneabsent hence a long while) about some fifteene dayes since was slaine.And they having heard, by proofe made in the Court of justice, thatone Aldobrandino Palermini (who is kept close prisoner) was themurtherer of him, as he came in a disguised habite to his daughter, ofwhom he was most affectionately enamoured; cannot chuse, but let theWorld know by their outward habits, the inward affliction of theirhearts, for a deede so dishonourably committed. Theobaldo wonderedgreatly hereat, imagining, that some man belike resembling him inshape, might be slaine in this manner, and by Aldobrandino, forwhose misfortune he grieved marvellously. As concerning his Mistresse,he understood that shee was living, and in good health; and nightdrawing on apace, he went to his lodging, with infinite molestationsin his minde, where after supper, he was lodged in a Corne-loft withhis man. Now by reason of many disturbing imaginations, whichincessantly wheeled about his braine, his bed also being none of thebest, and his supper (perhaps) somewhat of the coursest; a greatpart of the night was spent, yet could he not close his eyes together.But lying still broade awake, about the dead time of night, he heardthe treading of divers persons over his head, who discended downe apaire of stayres by his Chamber, into the lower parts of the house,carrying a light with them, which he discerned by the chinkes andcrannies in the wall. Stepping softly out of his bed, to see whatthe meaning hereof might be, he espied a faire young woman, whocarried a light in her hand, and three men in her company,descending downe the stayres together, one of them speaking thus tothe young woman. Now we may boldly warrant our saftey, because we haveheard it assuredly, that the death of Theobaldo Elisei, hath beenesufficiently approved by the Brethren, against Aldobrandino Palermini,and he hath confessed the fact; whereupon the sentence is alreadyset downe in writing. But yet it behooveth us notwithstanding, toconceale it very secretly, because if ever hereafter it should beknowne, that we are they who murthered him, we shall be in the samedanger, as now Aldobrandino is.

　　When Theobaldo had heard these words, hee began to consider withhimselfe, how many and great the dangers are, wherewith mens minds maydayly be molested. First, he thought on his owne brethren in theirsorrow, and buried a stranger insteed of him, accusing afterward (byfalse opinion, and upon the testimony of as false witnesses) a manmost innocent, making him ready for the stroke of death. Next, he madea strict observation in his soule, concerning the blinded severityof Law, and the Ministers thereto belonging, who pretending a diligentand carefull inquisition for truth, doe oftentimes (by theirtortures and torments) heare lies avouched (onely for ease of paine)in the place of a true confession, yet thinking themselves (by doingso) to be the Ministers of God and justice, whereas indeede they arethe Divels executioners of his wickednesse. Lastly, converting histhoughts to Aldobrandino, the imagined murtherer of a man yetliving, infinite cares beleagured his soule, in devising what mightbest be done for his deliverance.

　　So soone as he was risen in the morning, leaving his servant behindehim in his lodging, he went (when he thought it fit time) all alonetoward the house of his Mistresse, where finding by good fortune thegate open, he entred into a small Parlour beneath, and where he sawhis Mistresse sitting on the ground, wringing hands, and wofullyweeping, which (in meere compassion) moved him to weepe likewise;and going somewhat neere her, he saide. Madame, torment your selfeno more, for your peace is not farre off from you. The Gentlewomanhearing him say so, lifted up her head, and in teares spake thus. Goodman, thou seemest to me to be a Pilgrime stranger; what doest thouknow, either concerning my peace, or mine affliction? Madame(replied the Pilgrime) I am of Constantinople, and (doubtlesse) amconducted hither by the hand of Heaven, to convert your teares intorejoycing, and to deliver your Father from death. How is this?answered shee: If thou be of Constantinople, and art but now arrivedhere; doest thou know who we are, either I, or my Father?

　　The Pilgrime discoursed to her, even from the one end to theother, the history of her husbands sad disasters, telling her, howmany yeeres since she was espoused to him, and many other importantmatters, which well shee knew, and was greatly amazed thereat,thinking him verily to be a Prophet, and kneeling at his feete,entreated him very earnestly, that if he were come to deliver herFather Aldobrandino from death, to doe it speedily, because the timewas very short. The Pilgrime appearing to be a man of great holinesse,saide. Rise up Madame, refraine from weeping, and observeattentively what I shall say; yet with this caution, that you neverreveale it to any person whatsoever. This tribulation whereinto youare falne, (as by revelation I am faithfully informed) is for agrievous sinne by you heretofore committed, whereof divine mercy iswilling to purge you, and to make a perfect amends by a sensiblefeeling of this affliction; as seeking your sound and absoluterecovery, least you fall into farre greater danger then before. Goodman (quoth shee) I am burthened with many sinnes, and doe not know forwhich any amends should be made by me; any one sooner then other:wherefore if you have intelligence thereof, for charities sake tell itme, and I will doe so much as lieth in me, to make a full satisfactionfor it. Madame, answered the Pilgrime, I know well enough what itis, and will demand it no more of you, to winne any furtherknowledge thereof, then I have already: but because in revealing ityour selfe, it may touch you with the more true compunction ofsoule; let us goe to the point indeede, and tell mee, doe youremember, that at any time you were married to an Husband, or no?

　　At the hearing of these words, shee breathed foorth a veryvehement sigh, and was stricken with admiration at this question,beleeving that not any one had knowledge thereof. Howbeit, since theday of the supposed Theobaldaes buriall, such a rumour ran abroade, bymeanes of some speeches, rashly dispersed by a friend ofTheobaldoes, who (indeede) knew it; whereupon shee returned him thisanswer. It appeareth to me (good man) that divine ordinativationhath revealed unto you all the secrets of men; and therefore I amdetermined, not to conceale any of mine from you. True it is, thatin my younger yeeres, being left a widdow, I entirely affected anunfortunate young Gentleman, who (in secret) was my Husband, and whosedeath is imposed on my Father. The death of him I have the morebemoaned, because (in reason) it did neerely concerne me, by shewingmy selfe so savage and rigorous to him before his departure:neverthelesse, let me assure you Sir, that neither his parting longabsence from me, or his untimely death, never had the power to bereavemy heart of his remembrance.

　　Madame, saide the Pilgrime, the unfortinate young Gentleman thatis slaine, did never love you; but sure I am, that Theobaldo Eliseiloved you deerely. But tell me, what was the occasion whereby youconceived such hatred against him? Did he at any time offend you? Notruly Sir, quoth shee; but the reason of my anger towards him, wasby the words and threatnings of a religious Father, to whom once Irevealed (under confession) how faithfully I affected him, and whatprivate familiarity had passed betweene us. When iristantly he usedsuch dreadfull threatnings to me, and which (even yet) doe afflictmy soule, that I did not abstaine, and utterly refuse him, theDivell would fetch me quicke to Hell, and cast me into the bottomeof his quenchlesse and everlasting fire.

　　These menaces were so prevailing with me, as I refused all furtherconversition with Theobaldo, in which regard, I would receiveneither letters or messages from him. Howbeit, I am perswaded, that ifhe had continued here still, and not departed hence in suchdesperate manner as hee did, seeing him melt and consume dayly away,even as Snow by power of the Sunne-beames: my austere deliberation hadbeene long agoe quite altered, because not at any time (since then)life hath allowed me one merry day, neither did I, or ever can loveany man like unto him.

　　At these wordes the Pilgrime sighed, and then proceeded on againethus. Surely Madame, this one onely sin, may justly torment you,because I know for a certainty, that Theobaldo never offered you anyin many, the day hee first became enamoured of you; and what graceor favour you affoorded him, was your owne voluntary gift, and (ashe tooke it) no more then in modesty might well become you; for heeloving you first, you had beene most cruell and unkinde, if you shouldnot have requited him with the like affection. If then he continued sojust and loyall to you, as (of mine owne knowledge) I am able to sayhe did; what should move you to repulse him so rudely? Such mattersought well to bee considered on before hand; for if you did imagine,that you should repent it as an action ill done, yet you could not doeit, because as hee became yours, so were you likewise onely his; andhe being yours, you might dispose of him at your pleasure, as beingtruely obliged to none but you. How could you then with-draw yourselfe from him, being onely his, and not commit most manifest theft, afarre unfitting thing for you to doe, except you had gone with hisconsent.

　　Now Madame, let me further give you to understand, that I am areligious person, and a pilgrime, and therefore am well acquaintedwith all the courses of their dealing; if therefore I speakesomewhat more amply of them, and for your good, it can not be sounseeming for mee to doe it, as it would appeare ugly in another. Inwhich respect, I will speake the more freely to you, to the ende, thatyou may take better knowledge of them, then (as it seemeth) hithertoyou have done. In former passed times such as professed Religion, werelearned and most holy persons; but our religious professours nowadayes, and such as covet to bee so esteemed; have no matter at all ofReligion in them, but onely the outward shew and habite. Which yetis no true badge of Religion neither, because it was ordained byreligious institutions, that their garments should bee made ofarrow, plaine, and coursest spun cloth, to make a publikemanifestation to the world, that (in meere devotion, and religiousdisposition) by wrapping their bodies in such base clothing, theycondemned and despised all temporall occasions. But now adaies theymake them large, deepe, glistering, and of the finest cloth or stuffesto bee gotten, reducing those habites to so proude and pontificall aforme, that they walke Peacock-like, rustling, and strouting with themin the Churches; yea, and in open publike places, as if they wereordinary secular persons, to have their pride more notoriouslyobserved. And as the Angler bestoweth his best cunning, with oneline and baite to catch many fishes at one strike; even so do thesecounterfeited habit-mongers, by their dissembling and craftydealing, beguile many credulous widdowes: simple women, yea, and menof weake capacity, to credit whatsoever they doe or say, and hereinthey doe most of all exercise themselves.

　　And to the end, that my speeches may not savor of any untruthagainst them; these men which I speake of, have not any habite atall of religious men, but onely the colour of their garments, andwhereas they in times past, desired nothing more then the salvation ofmens soules; these fresher witted fellowes, covet after women andwealth, and employ all their paines by their whispering confessions,and figures of painted fearefull examples, to affright and terrifieunsetled and weake consciences, by horrible and blasphemousspeeches; yet adding perswasion withall, that their sinnes may bepurged by Almes-deedes and Masses. To the end, that such as creditthem in these their dayly courses, being guided more by apparance ofdevotion, then any true compunction of heart, to escape severepenances by them enjoyned: may some of them bring bread, otherswine, others coyne, all of them matter of commoditie and benefit,and simply say, these gifts are for the soules of their good friendsdeceased.

　　I make not any doubt, but almes-deedes and prayers, are very mighty;and prevailing meanes, to appease heavens anger for some sinnescommitted; but if such as bestow them, did either see or know, to whomthey give them: they would more warily keepe them, or else cast thembefore Swine, in regard they are altogether so unworthy of them. Butcome we now to the case of your ghostly father, crying out in youreare, that secret mariage was a most greevous sinne: Is not the breachthereof farre greater? Familiar conversation betweene man and manand woman, is a concession meerely naturall: but to rob, kill, orbanish any one, proceedeth from the mindes malignity. That thou didrob Theobaldo, your selfe hath already sufficiently witnessed, bytaking that from him, which with free consent in mariage you gave him.Next I must say, that by all the power remaining in you, you kild him,because you would not permit him to remaine with you, declaring yourselfe in the very height of cruelty, that hee might destroy his lifeby his owne hands. In which case the Law requireth, that whosoeveris the occasion of an ill act committed, hee or she is as deepe in thefault, as the party that did it. Now concerning his banishment, andwandring seaven yeeres in exile thorow the world; you cannot denie,but that you were the onely occasion thereof. In all which threeseverall actions, farre more capitally have you offended; then bycontracting of mariage in such clandestine manner.

　　But let us see, whether Theobaldo deserved all these severallcastigations, or not. In trueth he did not, your selfe haveconfessed (beside that which I know) that hee loved you more deerelythen himselfe, and nothing could be more honoured, magnified andexalted, then dayly you were by him, above all other women whatsoever.When hee came in any place, where honestly, and without suspitionhee might speake to you: all his honour, and all his liberty, laywholly committed into your power. Was hee not a noble young Gentleman?Was he (among all those parts that most adorne a man, and appertaineto the very choycest respect) inferiour to any one of best merit inyour Citie? I know that you cannot make deniall to any of thesedemands. How could you then by the perswasion of a beast, a foole, avillaine, yea, a vagabond, envying both his happinesse and yours,enter into so cruell a minde against him? I know not what errormisguideth women, in scorning and despising their husbands: but ifthey entred into a better consideration, understanding triely whatthey are, and what nobility of nature God hath endued man withall,farre above all other creatures; it would bee their highest title ofglory, when they are so preciously esteemed of them, so dearelyaffected by them, and so gladly embraced in all their best abilities.

　　This is so great a sinne, as the divine justice (which in anequall Ballance bringeth all operations to their full effect) didnot purpose to leave unpunished; but as you enforced against allreason, to take away Theobaldo from your selfe: even so your fatherAldobrandino, without any occasion given by Theobaldo, is in perill ofhis life, and you a partaker of his tribulation. Out of which if youdesire to be delivered, it is very convenient that you promise onething which I shall tell you, and may much better be by you performed.Namely, that if Theobaido do returne from his long banishment, youshall restore him to your love, grace, and good acceptation;accounting him in the selfe-same degree of favour and privateentertainment, as he was at the first, before your wicked ghostlyfather so hellishly incensed you against him.

　　When the Pilgrim had finished his speeches, the Gentlewoman whohad listned to them very attentively (because all the edged reasonsappeared to be plainly true) became verily perswaded, that all theseafictions had falne on her and her father, for the ingratefull offenceby her committed, and therefore thus is replied. Worthy man, and thefriend to goodnesse, I know undoubtedly, that the words which you havespoken are true, and also I understand by your demonstration, whatmanner of people some of those religious persons are, whomheretofore I have reputed to be Saints, but find them now to be farotherwise. And to speake truly, I perceive the fault to be great andgreevous, wherein I have offended against Theobaldo, and would (if Icould) willingly make amends, even in such manner as you have advised.But how is it possible to be done? Theobaldo being dead, can be [no]more recalled to this life; and therefore, I know not what promise Ishould make, in a matter which is not to bee performed. Whereto thePilgrime without any longer pausing, thus answered.

　　Madam, by such revelations as have beene shewne to me, I know fora certainety, that Theobaldo is not dead, but living, in health, andin good estate; if he had the fruition of your grace and favour.Take heede what you say Sir (quoth the Gentlewoman) for I saw himlye slain before my doore, his bodie having received many wounds,which I folded in mine armes, and washed his face with my brinishteares; whereby (perhaps) the scandall arose, that flew abroad to mydisgrace. Beleeve me Madam, replyed the Pilgrim, say what you will,I dare assure you that Theobaldo is living, and if you dare makepromise, concerning what hath bin formerly requested, and keepe itinviolably, I make no doubt, but you your selfe shall shortly see him.I promise it (quoth she) and binde my selfe thereto by a sacredoath, to keepe it faithfully: for never could any thing happen toyeeld me the like contentment, as to see my Father free from danger,and Theobaldo living.

　　At this instant Theobaldo thought it to be a very apt and convenienttime to disclose himselfe, and to comfort the Lady, with an assuredsignall of hope, for the deliverance of her Father, wherefore he said:Ladie, to the end that I may comfort you infallibly in thisdangerous perill of your fathers life, I am to make knowne anespeciall secret to you, which you are to keepe carefully (as youtender your owne life) from ever being revealed to the world. Theywere then in a place of sufficient privacie, and by themselves,because she reposed great confidence in the Pilgrims sanctity or life,as thinking him none other then he seemed to be. Theobaldo tooke outof his Purse a Ring, which she gave him the last night of theirconversing together, and he had kept with no meane care: and shewingit to her, said; Do you know this Ring Madam? So soone as she sawit, immediatly she knew it, and answered, Yes Sir, I know the Ring,and confesse that heretofore I gave it to Theobaldo.

　　Heereupon the Pilgrime stood up, and sodainly putting off hispoore linnen Frock, and the Hood from his head, using his Florentinetongue, he said; Tell me Madam, do you not know me? When she hadadvisedly beheld him, and knew him indeed to be Theobaldo, she wasstricken into a wonderfull astonishment, being as fearfull of him,as she was of the dead body which she saw lying in the street. And Idare assure you, that she durst not go neere him, to respect him asTheobaldo lately come from Cyprus, but (in terror) fled away from him;as if Theobaldo had bin newly risen out of his grave, and came thitherpurposely to affright her; wherefore he said. Be not affraid Madam,I am your Theobaldo, in health, alive, and never as yet died,neither have I received any wounds to kill mee, as you and my brethrenhad formerly imagined.

　　Some better assurance getting possession of her, as knowing himperfectly by his voice, and looking more stedfastly on his face, whichconstantly avouched him to be Theobaldo; the teares trickling amainedowne her faire cheekes, she ran to embrace him, casting her armesabout his necke, and kissing him a thousand times, my faithfullhusband, nothing in the world can be so welcom to me. Theobaldo havingmost kindly kissed and embraced her, said; Sweet wife, time wit notnow allow us those ceremonious courtesies, which (indeed) so long aseparation do justly challenge; for I must about a more weightybusines, to have your Father safely delivered, which I hope to dobefore to morow night when you shall heare tydings to your bettercontentment. And questionlesse, if I speed no worse then my goodhope perswadeth me, I will see you againe to night, and acquaint youat better leysure, in such things as I cannot do now at this present.

　　So putting on his Pilgrimes habit againe, kissing her once more, andcomforting her with future good successe, he departed from her,going to the prison where Aldobrandino lay, whom hee found morepensive, as being in hourely expectation of death, then any hope hehad to be freed from it. Being brought neerer to him by theprisoners favour, as seeming to be a man come onely to comfort him:sitting downe by him, thus he began. Aldobrandino, I am a friend ofthine, whom Heaven hath sent to doe thee good, in meere pittie andcompassion of thine innocency. And therefore, if thou wilt grant meone small request, which I am earnestly to crave at thy hands, thoushalt heare (without any failing) before to morrow at night, thesentence of thy free absolution, whereas now thou expectest nothingbut death; whereunto Aldobrandino thus answered. Friendly man,seeing thou art so carefull of my safety (although I know thee not,neither doe remember that ere I saw thee till now) thou must needsbe some especiall kinde friend of mine. And to tell thee the truth,I never committed the sinful deed for which I am condemned to death.True it is, I have other heinous and greevous sins, which(undoubtedly) have throwne. this heavy judgement on me, andtherefore I am the more willing to undergo it. Neverthelesse, let methus I us farre assure thee, that I would gladly not onely promisesomething which might be to the glory of God, if he were pleased inthis case to have mercy on me; but also would as willingly performeand accomplish it. Wherefore, demaund whatsoever thou pleasest, forunfained (if I escape with life) I will truly keepe promise with thee.

　　Sir, replyed the Pilgrime, I desire nor demand any thing of you, butthat you would pardon the foure Brethren of Theobaldo, that broughtyou to this hard extremity, as thinking you to be guilty of theirbrothers death, and that you would also accept them as your brethrenand friends upon their craving pardon for what they have done.

　　Sir, answered Aldobrandino, no man knoweth how sweet revenge is, norwith what heate it is to be desired, but onely the man who hath benewronged. Notwithstanding, not to hinder hope, which onely aymeth atHeaven, I freely forgive them, and henceforth pardon them for ever,intending more. over, that if mercy give me life, and cleere me fromthis bloody imputation, to love and respect them so long as I shalllive. This answere was most pleasing to the Pilgrime, and withoutany further multiplication of speeches, he entreated him to be of goodcomfort, for he feared not but before the time prefixed, he shouldheare certaine tydings of his deliverance.

　　At his departing from him, hee went directly to the Signoria, andprevailed so far that he spake privately with a Knight, who was thenone of the States chiefest Lords, to whom he saide. Sir, a man oughtto bestow his best paines and diligence, that the truth of thingsshould be apparantly knowne, especially, such men as hold the placeand office as you doe: to the end, that those persons which havecommitted no foule offence, should not bee punished, but onely theguilty and haynous transgressors. And because it will be no meanehonor to you, to lay the blame where it worthily deserveth, I amcome hither purposely, to informe you in a case of most weightyimportance. It is not unknowne to you, with what rigour the State hathproceeded against Aldobrandino Palermini, and you think verily he isthe man that hath slaine Theobaldo Elisei, whereupon your Law hathcondemned him to die. I dare assure you Sir, that a very unjust coursehath beene taken in this case, because Aldobrandino is falslyaccused as you your selfe will confesse before midnight, when they aredelivered into your power, that were the murderers of the man.

　　The honest Knight, who was very sorrowfull for Aldobrandino,gladly gave attention to the Pilgrime, and having conferred on manymatters, appertaining to the fact committed: the two Brethren who wereTheobaldoes Hostes, and their Chambermaid, upon good advice given,were apprehended in their first sleep, without any resistance madein their defence. But when the tortures were sent for, to understandtruly how the case went, they would not endure any paine at all, buteach aside by himselfe, and then altogether confessed openly, thatthey did the deede, yet not knowing him to be Theobaldo Elisei. Andwhen it was demanded of them, upon what occasion they did so foulean act, they answered, that they were so hatefull against the manslife, because he would luxuriouslie have abused one of their wives,when they both were absent from their owne home.

　　When the Pilgrim had heard their voluntary confession, he tookehis leave of his Knight, returning secretly to the house of MadamHermelina, and there (because all her people were in their beds) shecarefully awaited his returne, to beare some glad tydings of herfather, and to make a further reconciliation betweene her andTheobaldo, when sitting downe by her, he said: Deare Love, be ofgood cheere, for (upon my word) to morrow you shall have your fatherhome safe, well, and delivered from all further danger: and toconfirme her the more confidently in his words, he declared at largethe whole carriage of the businesse. Hermelina being wondrouslyjoyfull, for two such succesefull accidents to injoy her husband aliveand in health, and also to have her father freed from so great adanger; kissed and embraced him most affectionately, welcomming himlovingly into her bed, whereto so long time hee had beene a stranger.

　　No sooner did bright day appeare, but Theobaldo arose, havingacquainted her with such matters as were to be done, and once moreearnestly desiring her, to conceale (as yet) these occurrences toher selfe. So in his Pilgrims habit, he departed from her house, toawaite convenient: opportunity, for attending on the businessebelonging to Aldobrandino. At the usuall houre appointed, the Lordswere all set in the Signioria, and had received full information,concerning the offence imputed to Aldobrandino, setting him at libertyby publique consent, and sentencing the other malefactors withdeath, who (within a few dayes after) were beheaded in place themurther was committed. Thus Aldobrandino being released, to hisexceeding comfort, and no small joy of his daughter, kindred, andfriends, all knowing perfectly, that this had happened by the Pilgrimsmeanes, they conducted him home to Aldobrandinoes house, where theydesired him to continue so long as himselfe pleased, using him withmost honourable and gracious respect, bilt especially Hermelina, whoknew (better then the rest) on whom she bestowed her liberall favours,yet concealing all closely to her selfe. After two or three dayes wereover-past, in these complementall entercoursings of kindnesse,Theobaldo began to consider, that it was high time for reconciliation,to be solemnely past betweene his brethren and Aldobrandino. For, theywere not a little amazed at his strange deliverance, and went likewisecontinually armed, as standing in feare of Aldobrandino and hisfriends; which made him the more earnest, for accomplishment of thepromise formerly made unto him. Aldobrandino lovingly replied, that hewas ready to make good his word. Whereupon, the Pilgrime provided agoodly Banquet, whereat he pursued to have present Aldobrandino, hisDaughter, Kindred, and their wives. But first, himselfe went inperson, to invite them in peace to his banquet, using many pregnantand forcible reasons to them, such as are requisite in the likediscordant cases. In the end, they were so wise and prevailing withthem that they willingly condiscended, and thought it no disparagementunto them, for the recovery of Aldobrandinoes kindnesse againe, tocrave pardon for their great error committed. On the morrow following,about dinner time, the foure brethren of Theobaldo, attired in theirmourning garments, with their wives and frends came first to the houseof Aldobrandino, who purposely stayed for them; and having laiddowne their weapons on the ground, in the presence of all such asAldobrandino had invited as his witnesses, they offered themselvesto his mercy, and humbly required pardon of him, for the matterwherein they had offended him. Aldobrandino shedding teares, mostlovingly embraced them, and (to be briefe) pardoned whatsoeverinjuries he had received. After this, the sisters and wives, allclad in mourning, courteously submitted themselves, and weregraciously welcommed by Madame Hermelina, as also divers otherGentlewomen there present with her. Being all seated at the Tables,which were furnished with such rarities as could be wished for; althings else deserved their due commendation, but onely sad silence,occasioned by the fresh remembrance of sorow, appearing in the habitesof Theobaldoes friends and kindred, which the Pilgrim himselfe plainlyperceived, to be the onely disgrace to him and his feast. Wherefore,as before he had resolved, when time served to purge away thismelancholly, he arose from the Table, when some (as yet) had scarsebegun to eate, and thus spake.

　　Gracious company, there is no defect in this Banquet, or more debarsit of the honour it might else have, but onely the presence ofTheobaldo, who having bin continually in your company, it seemes youare not willing to take knowledge of him, and therefore I meane myselfe to shew him. So, uncasing himselfe out of his Pilgrimes clothes,and standing in his Hose and Doublet, to their no little admiration,they all knew him, yet doubted whether it were he, or no. Which heperceiving, he repeated his brethrens and absent kindreds names, andwhat occurrences hapned betweene them from time to time, beside therelation of his owne passed fortunes, inciting teares in the eyes ofhis brethren, and all else there present, every one hugging andembracing him, yea, many beside, who were no kin at all to him.Hermelina onely excepted: which when Aldobrandino saw, he said untoher; How now Hermelina? Why doest thou not welcome home Theobaldo,so kindly as the rest have done?

　　She making a modest courtesie to her Father, and answering soloude as every one might her, There is not any one in this assemblythat more willingly would give him all expression of a joyfullwelcom home and thankefull gratitude for such especiall favoursreceived, then in my heart I could affoord to do, but onely inregard of those infamous speeches noysed out against me, on the daywhen we wept for him, who was supposed to be Theobaldo, whichslander was to my great discredit. Go on boldly, replied Aldobrandino,doest thou think that I regard any such praters? In the procuring ofmy deliverance, he hath approved them to be manifest lyars, albeit Imy selfe did never credit them. Go then I command thee, and- let mesee thee both kisse and embrace him. She who desired nothing more,shewed her selfe not sloth full in obeying her father to do but herduty to her husband. Wherefore being risen, as all the rest haddone, but yet in farre more effectuall manner, she declared herunfained love to Theobaldo. These bountifull favours ofAldobrandino, were joyfully accepted by Theobaldoes brethren, asalso to every one there present; so that all former rancour and hatredwhich had caused heavie variances betweene them, was now convertedto mutuall kindnesse and solemne friendship on every side.

　　When the feasting dayes were finished, the garments of sadmourning were quite laid aside, and those (becomming so generall ajoy) put on, to make their hearts and habites suteable. Now,concerning the man slaine, and supposed to be Theobaldo, hee wasone, that in all parts of body, and truenesse of complexion so neerelyresembled him, as Theobaldoes owne brethren could not distinguishthe one from the other: but hee was of Lunigiana, named Fatinolo,and not Theobaldo, whom the two Brethren Inne-keepers maliced, aboutsome idle suspition conceived, and having slaine him, layde his bodyat the doore of Aldobrandino, where by reason of Theobaldoesabsence, it was generally reputed to be hee, and Aldobrandinocharged to doe the deede, by vehement perswasion of the brethren,knowing what love had passed betweene him and his daughterHermelina. But happy was the Pilgrims returne, first to heare thosewords in the Inne, the meanes to bring the murther to light, andthen the discreet carriage of the Pilgrime, untill he plainly approvedhimselfe, to bee truely Theobaldo.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE EIGHT NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DISPLAYED, THE APPARANT FOLLY OF JEALOUSIE: AND THE

　　SUBTILITY OF SOME RELIGIOUS CARNALL MINDED MEN, TO

　　BEGUILE SILLY AND SIMPLE MARIED MEN

　　Ferando, by drinking a certaine kinde of powder, was buried dead.And by the Abbot, who was enamored of his Wife, was taken out of hisGrave, and put into a darke prison, where they made him beleeve,that hee was in Purgatorie. Afterward, when time came that heeshould be, raised to life againe; he was made to keepe a childewhich the Abbot had got by his Wife.

　　When the long discourse of Madame Emilia was ended, notdispleasing to any, in regard of the length, but rather held tooshort, because no exceptions could bee taken against it, comparing theraritie of the accidents, and changes together: the Queene turned toMadame Lauretto, giving her such a manifest signe, as she knew, thatit was her turne to follow next, and therefore shee tooke occasionto begin thus. Faire Ladies, I intend to tell you a Tale of trueth,which (perhaps) in your opinions, will seeme to sound like a lye:and yet I heard by the very last relation, that a dead man was weptand mournd for, in sted of another being then alive. In which respect,I am now to let you know, how a living man was buried for dead, andbeing raised againe, yet not as living, himselfe, and divers morebeside, did beleeve that he came forth of his grave, and adored him asa Saint, who was the occasion thereof, and who (as a bad man.)deserved justly to be condemned.

　　In Tuscanie there was sometime an Abbey, seated, as now we seecommonly they are, in a place not much frequented with people, andthereof a Monke was Abbot, very holy and curious in all things else,save onely a wanton appetite to women: which yet he kept so cleanly tohimselfe, that though some did suspect it, yet it was knowne to veryfew. It came to passe, that a rich Country Franklin, named Ferando,dwelt as neere neighbour to the said Abby, he being a man materiall,of simple and grosse understanding, yet he fell into great familiaritywith the Abbot; who made use of this friendly conversation to no otherend, but for divers times of recreation; when he delighted to smile athis silly and sottish behaviour.

　　Upon this his private frequentation with the Abbot, at last heobserved, that Ferando had a very beautifull woman to his Wife, withwhom he grew so deeply in love, as he had no other meditationseither by day or night, but how to become acceptable in her favour.Neverthelesse, he concealed his amorous passions privately tohimselfe, and could plainely perceive, that although Ferando (in allthings else) was meerely a simple fellow, and more like an Idiot, thenof any sensible apprehension: yet was he wise enough in loving hisWife, keeping her carfully out of all company, as one (indeede) veryjealous, least any should kisse her, but onely himselfe, which drovethe Abbot into despaire, for ever attaining the issue of his desire.Yet being subtill, crafty, and cautelous, he wrought so on theflexible nature of Ferando, that hee brought his wife with himdivers dayes to the Monasterie; where they walked in the goodlyGarden, discoursing on the beatitudes of eternall life, as also themost holy deedes of men and women, long since departed out of thislife, in mervailous civill and modest manner. Yet all these were buttraines to a further intention, for the Abbot must needes be herghostly Father, and she come to be confessed by him; which the fooleFerando tooke as an especiall favour, and therefore he gave hisconsent the sooner.

　　At the appointed time, when the woman came to confession to theAbbot, and was on her knees before him, to his no small contentment,before she would say any thing else, thus she began: Sacred Father, ifGod had not given me such an husband as I have, or else had bestowedon me none at all; I might have beene so happy, by the meanes ofyour holy doctrine, very easily to have entred into the way, whereofyou spake the other day, which leadeth to eternall life. But when Iconsider with my selfe, what manner of man Ferando is, and thinke uponhis folly withall; I may well terme my selfe to be a widow, although Iam a maried wife, because while he liveth, I cannot have any otherhusband. And yet (as sottish as you see him) he is (without anyoccasion given him) so extreamely jealous of me; as I am not able tolive with him, but only in continuall tribulation and hearts griefe.In which respect, before I enter into confession, I most humblybeseech you, that you would vouchsafe (in this distresse) to assist mewith your fatherly advice and counsell, because, if thereby I cannotattaine to a more pleasing kinde of happinesse; neither confessior, orany thing else, is able to doe me any good at all.

　　These words were not a little welcome to my Lord Abbot, because(thereby) he halfe assured himselfe, that Fortune had laid open thepath to his hoped pleasures. Whereupon he said. Deare daughter, I makeno question to the contrary, but it must needes be an exceedinginfelicity, to so faire and goodly a young woman as you are, to beplagued with so sottish an husband, brainsick, and without the useof common understanding; but yet subject to a more hellishaffliction then all these, namely jealousie, and therefore you beingin this wofull manner tormented, your tribulations are not only somuch the more credited, but also as amply grieved for, and pittied. Inwhich heavy and irksome perturbations, I see not any meanes of remedy,but onely one, being a kinde of physicke (beyond all other) to curehim of his foolish jealousie; which medicine is very familiar to me,because I know best how to compound it, alwayes provided, that you canbe of so strong a capacity, as to be secret in what I shall say untoyou.

　　Good Father (answered the Woman) never make you any doubt thereof,for I would rather endure death it selfe, then disclose any thingwhich you enjoyne me to keepe secret: wherefore, I beseech you Sirto tell me, how, and by what meanes it may be done. If (quoth theAbbot) you desire to have him perfectly cured, of disease so dangerousand offensive, of necessity he Must be sent into Purgatory. How maythat be done, saide the woman, he being alive? He must needs die,answered the Abbot, for his more speedy passage thither; and when hehath endured so much punishment, as may expiate the quality of hisjealousie, we have certaine devoute and zealous prayers, whereby tobring him backe againe to life, in as able manner as ever he was.Why then, replyed the woman, I must remaine in the state of aWiddow? Very true, saide the Abbot, for a certaine time, in allwhich space, you may not (by no meanes) marrie againe, because theheavens will therewith be highly offended: but Ferando beingreturned to life againe, you must repossesse him as your Husband,but never to be jealous any more. Alas Sir (quoth the woman) so thathe may be cured of his wicked jealousie, and I no longer live insuch an hellish imprisonment, do as you please.

　　Now was the Abbot (well neere) on the highest step of his hope,making her constant promise, to accomplish it: But (quoth he) whatshall be my recompence when I have done it? Father, saide she,whatsoever you please to aske, if it remaine within the compasse of mypower: but you being such a vertuous and sanctified man, and I a womanof so meane worth or merit; what sufficient recompence can I be ableto make you? Whereunto the Abbot thus replyed. Faire woman, you areable to do as much for me, as I am for you, because I doe dispose myselfe, to performe a matter for your comfort and consolation, evenso ought you to be as mindfull of me, in any action concerning my lifeand welfare. In any such matter Sir (quoth she) depending on yourbenefit so strictly, you may safely presume to command me. You mustthen (saide the Abbot) grant me your love, and the kinde embracingof your person; because so violent are mine affections, as I pineand consume away daily, till I enjoy the fruition of my desires, andnone can helpe me therein but you.When the woman heard these words, as one confounded with muchamazement, thus shee replied. Alas, holy Father! What a strange motionhave you made to me? I beleeved very faithfully, that you were nolesse then a Saint, and is it convenient, that when silly women cometo ask counsell of such sanctified men, they should returne themsuch unfitting answeres? Be not amazed good woman, saide the Abbot, atthe motion which I have made unto you, because holinesse is notthereby impaired a jot in me; for it is the inhabitant of the soule,the other is an imperfection attending on the body: but be itwhatsoever, your beauty hath so powerfully prevailed on me, thatentire love hath compelld me to let you know it. And more may youboast of your beauty, then any that ever I beheld before, considering,it is so pleasing to a sanctified man, that it can draw him fromdivine contemplations, to regard a matter of so humble an equalitie.

　　Let me tell you moreover, woorthy Woman, that see me reverenced hereas Lord Abbot, yet am I but as other men are, and in regard I amneither aged, nor mishapen, me thinkes the motion I have made,should be the lesse offensive to you, and therefore the soonergranted. For, all the while as Ferando remaineth in Purgatory, doe youbut imagine him to be present with you, and your perswasion will themore absolutely be confirmed. No man can, or shall be privy to ourclose meetings, for I carry the same holy opinion among all men, asyou your selfe conceived of me, and none dare be so saucie, as to callin question whatsoever I doe or say, because my words are Oracles, andmine actions more than halfe miracles; doe you not then refuse sogracious an offer. Enow there are, who would gladly enjoy that,which is francke and freely presented to you, and which (if you be awise Woman) is meerely impossible for you to refuse. Richly am Ipossessed of Gold and Jewels, which shall be all yours, if youplease in favour to be mine, wherein I will not be gaine-saide, exceptyour selfe do deny me.

　　The Woman having her eyes fixed on the ground, knew not well howshee should denie him; and yet in plaine words, to say shee consented,shee held it to be overbase and immodest, and ill agreeing with herformer reputation: when the Abbot had well noted this attention inher, and how silent shee stood without returning any answere; heaccounted the conquest to be more then halfe his owne: so thatcontinuing on his former perswasions, hee never ceased, but alluredher still to beleeve whatsoever he saide. And much ashamed of hisimportunity, but more of her owne flexible yeelding weaknesse, madeanswere, that shee would willingly accomplish his request; which yetshee did not absolutely grant, untill Ferando were first sent intoPurgatory. And till then (quoth the Abbot) I will not urge any more,because I purpose his speedy sending thither: but yet, so farre lendme your assistance, that either to morrow, or else the next day, hemay come hither once more to converse with me. So putting a faire goldRing on her finger, they parted till the next meeting.

　　Not a little joyfull was the Woman of so rich a gift, hoping toenjoy a great many more of them, and returning home to her neighbours,acquainted them with wonderfull matters, all concerning thesanctimonious life of the Abbot, a meere miracle of men, and worthy tobe truely termed a Saint. Within two dayes after, Ferando went tothe Abbey againe, and so soone as the Abbot espyed him, he presentlyprepared for his sending of him into Purgatorie. He never waswithout a certaine kinde of drugge, which being beaten into powder,would worke so powerfully upon the braine, and all the other vitallsenses, as to entrance them with a deadly sleepe, and deprive themof all motion, either in the pulses, or in any other part else, evenas if the body were dead indeede; in which operation, it would so holdand continue, according to the quantity given and drunke, as itpreased the Abbot to order the matter. This powder or drugge, was senthim by a great Prince of the East, and therewith he wrought wondersupon his Novices, sending them into Purgatory when he pleased, andby such punishments as he inflicted on them there, made them (likecredulous asses) believe whatsoever himselfe listed.

　　So much of this powder had the Abbot provided, as should suffice forthree dayes entrancing, and having compounded it with a verypleasant Wine, calling Ferando into his Chamber, there gave it himto drinke, and afterward walked with him about the Cloyster, in veryfriendly conference together, the silly sot never dreaming on thetreachery intended against him. Many Monkes beside were recreatingthemselves in the Cloyster, most of them delighting to behold thefollies of Ferando, on whom the potion beganne so to worke, that heslept in walking, nodding and reeling as hee went, till at the last hefell downe, as if he had bene dead.

　　The Abbot pretending great admiration at this accident, called hisMonkes about him, all labouring by rubbing his temples, throwingcold water and vinegar in his face, to revive him againe; alleagingthat some fume or vapour in the stomacke, had thus over-awed hisunderstanding faculties, and quite deprived him of life indeede. Atlength, when by tasting the pulse, and all their best employed paines,they saw that their labour was spent in vaine; the Abbot used suchperswasions to the Monkes, that they all beleeved him to be dead:whereupon they sent for his wife and friends, who crediting as much asthe rest did, were very sad and sorrowfull for him.

　　The Abbot (cloathed as he was) laide him in a hollow vault under aTombe, such as there are used instead of Graves; his Wife returninghome againe to her House, with a young Sonne which shee had by herHusband, protesting to keepe still within her House, and never more tobe seene in any company, but onely to attend her young Sonne, and bevery carefull of such wealth as her Husband had left unto her.From the City of Bologna, that very instant day, a well staide andgoverned Monke there arrived, who was a neere kinsman to the Abbot,and one whom he might securely trust. In the dead time of the night,the Abbot and this Monke arose, and taking Ferando out of the vault,carried him into a darke dungeon or prison, which he termed by thename of Purgatory, and where hee used to discipline his Monkes, whenthey had committed any notorious offence, deserving to be punishedin Purgatory. There they tooke off all his usuall wearing garments,and cloathed him in the habite of a Monke, even as if he had beene oneof the house; and laying him m a bundle of straw, so left him untillhis senses should be restored againe. On the day following, late inthe evening, the Abbot, accompanied with his trusty Monke, (by wayof visitation) went to see and comfort the supposed widow, finding herattired in blacke, very sad and pensive, which by his wontedperswasions, indifferently he appeased; challenging the benefit ofpromise. Shee being thus alone, not hindered by her Husbandsjealousie, and espying another goodly gold Ring on his finger, howfrailety and folly over-ruled her, I know not, shee was a weake woman,he a divelish deluding man; and the strongest holdes by over longbattery and besieging, must needs yeeld at the last, as I feare sheedid: for very often afterward, the Abbot used in this manner tovisit her, and the simple ignorant Country people, carrying no suchill opinion of the holy Abbot, and having- seene Ferando lying fordead in the vault, and also in the habite of a Monke; were verilyperswaded, that when they saw the Abbot passe by to and fro, butmost commonly in the night season, it was the ghost of Ferando, whowalked in this manner after his death, as a just pennance for hisjealousie.

　　When Ferandoes senses were recovered againe, and he found himselfeto be in such a darkesome place; not knowing where he was, hebeganne to crie and make a noyse. When presently the Monke ofBologna (according as the Abbot had tutored him) stept into thedungeon, carrying a little waxe candle in the one hand, and a smartingwhip in the other, going to Ferando, he stript off his cloathes, andbegan to lash him very soundly. Ferando roaring and crying, couldsay nothing else, but where am I? The Monke (with a dreadfull voyce)replyed: Thou art in Purgatory. How? saide Ferando; what? Am I dead?Thou art dead (quoth the Monke) and began to lash him lustilyagaine. Poore Ferando, crying out for his Wife and little Sonne,demanded a number of idle questions, whereto the Monke still fittedhim with as fantasticke answers. Within a while after, he set bothfoode and wine before him, which when Ferando saw, he saide; How isthis? Doe dead men eate and drinke? Yes, replyed the Monke, and thisfoode which here thou seest, thy Wife brought hither to the Churchthis morning, to have Masses devoutly sung for thy soule, and as toother, so must it be set before thee, for such is the command of thePatrone of this place.

　　Ferando having lyen entranced three dayes and three nights, felt hisstomacke well prepared to eate, and feeding very heartily, stillsaide; O my good Wife, O my loving Wife, long mayest thou live forthis extraordinary kindnesse. I promise thee (sweete heart) while Iwas alive, I cannot remember, that ever any foode and wine was halfeso pleasing to me. O my deare Wife; O my hony Wife. Canst thou(quoth the Monke) prayse and commend her now, using her sovillainously in thy life time? Then did he whip him more fiercely thenbefore, when Ferando holding up his hands, as craving for mercy,demanded wherefore he was so severely punished? I am so commanded(quoth the Monke) by supreme power, and twice every day must thou bethus disciplinde. Upon what occasion? replyed Ferando. Because(quoth the Monke) thou wast most notoriously jealous of thy Wife, sheebeing the very kindest woman to thee, as all the Countrey containethnot her equall. It is too true, answered Ferando, I was over-muchjealous of her indeede: but had I knowne, that jealousie was such ahatefull sinne against Heaven, I never would have offended therein.

　　Now (quoth the Monke) thou canst confesse thine owne wilfull follie,but this should have beene thought on before, and whilest thou wastliving in the World. But if the Fates vouchsafe to favour thee somuch, as hereafter to send thee to the World once more; remember thypunishment here in Purgatory, and sinne no more in that foule sinne ofjealousie. I pray you Sir tell me, replyed Ferando, after men aredead, and put into Purgatory, is there any hope of their ever visitingthe World any more? Yes, saide the Monke, if the fury of the Fatesbe once appeased. O that I knew (quoth Ferando) by what meanes theywould be appeased, and let me visite the World on againe: I would bethe best Husband that ever lived, and never more be jealous, neverwrong so good a Wife, nor ever use one unkind word against her. In themeane while, and till their anger may be qualified; when next myWife doth send me food, I pray you worke so much, that some Candlesmay be sent me also, because I live here in uncomfortabledarkenesse; and what should I doe with food, if I have no light.Shee sends Lights enow, answered the Monke, but they are burnt outon the Altar in Masse-time, and thou canst have none other here, butsuch as I must bring my selfe; neither are they allowed, but onely forthe time of thy feeding and correcting.

　　Ferando breathing foorth a vehement sigh, desired to know what hewas, being thus appointed to punish him in Purgatory? I am (quoththe Monke) a dead man, as thou art, borne in Sardignia, where I serveda very jealous Master; and because: I soothed him in his jealousie,I had this pennance imposed on me, to serve thee here in Purgatorywith meate and drinke, and (twice every day) to discipline thy body,untill the Fates have otherwise determined both for thee and me.Why? saide Ferando, are any other persons here, beside you and I? Manythousands, replyed the Monke, whom thou canst neither heare nor see,no more then they are able to doe the like by us. But how farre, saideFerando, is Purgatory distant from our native Countries? About somefifty thousand leagues, answered the Monke; but yet passable in amoment, whensoever the offended Fates are pleased: and many Masses aredally saide for thy soule, at the earnest entreaty of thy Wife, inhope of thy conversion; and becomming a new man, hating to bejealous any more hereafter.

　　In these and such like speeches, as thus they beguiled the time,so did they observe it for a dayly course, sometime discipling,other whiles eating and drinking, for the space of ten whole monethstogether: in the which time, the Abbot sildome failed to visiteFerandoes wife, without the least suspition in any of theneighbours, by reason of their setled opinion, concerning thenightly walking Ferandoes ghost. But, as all pleasures cannot beeexempted from some following paine or other, so it came to passe, thatFerandoes wife proved to be conceived with childe, and the time wasdrawing on for her deliverance. Now began the Abbot to consider,that Ferandoes folly was sufficiently chastised, and he had beene longenough in Purgatory: wherefore, the better to countenance all passedinconveniences, it was now thought high time, that Ferando should besent to the world againe, and set free from the paines of Purgatory,as having payed for his jealousie dearely, to teach him betterwisedome hereafter.

　　Late in the dead time of the night, the Abbot himselfe entred intothe darke dungeon, and in an hollow counterfeited voyce, called toFerando, saying. Comfort thy selfe Ferando, for the Fates are nowpleased, that thou shalt bee released out of Purgatory, and sent tolive in the world againe. Thou didst leave thy wife newly conceivedwith childe, and this very morning she is delivered of a goodly Sonne,whom thou shalt cause to be named Bennet: because, by the incessantprayers of the holy Abbot, thine owne loving Wife, and for sweet SaintBennets sake, this grace and favour is afforded thee. Ferandohearing this, was exceeding joyfull, and returned this answere: Forever honored be the Fates, the holy Lord Abbot, blessed SaintBennet, and my most dearely beloved Wife, whom I will faithfullylove for ever, and never more offend her by any jealous in me.

　　When the next foode was sent to Ferando, so much of the powder wasmingled with the wine, as would serve onely for foure houresentrauncing, in which time, they clothed him in his owne wearingapparell againe, the Abbot himselfe in person, and his honest trustyMonke of Bologna, conveying and laying him in the same vault under theTombe, where at the first they gave him buriall. The next morningfollowing, the breake of day, Ferando recovered his senses, and thorowdivers chinkes and crannies of the Tombe, descried daylight, which heehad not see in tenne moneths space before. Perceiving then plainely,that he was alive, he cryed out aloude, saying: Open, open, and letmee forth of Purgatory, for I have beene heere long enough inconscience. Thrusting up his head against the cover of the Tombe,which was not of any great strength, neither well closed together; heeput it quite off the Tombe, and so got forth upon his feete: atwhich instant time, the Monks having ended their morning Mattins,and hearing the noyse, ran in hast thither, and knowing the voyce ofFerando, saw that he was come forth of the Monument.

　　Some of them were ancient Signiors of the house, and yet but meereNovices (as all the rest were) in these cunning and politiquestratagems of the Lord Abbot, when hee intended to punish any one inPurgatory: and therefore, being affrighted, and amazed at this rareaccident; they fled away from him, running to the Abbot, who makinga shew to them, as if he were but new come forth of his Oratory, ina kinde of pacifying speeches, saide; Peace my deare Sonnes, be notaffraide, but fetch the Crosse and Holy-water hither; then followme, and I will shew you, what miracles the Fates have pleased toshew in our Convent, therefore be silent, and make no more noise;all which was performed according to his command.

　　Ferando looking leane and pale, as one, that in so long time haddenot seene the light of heaven, and endured such strict disciplinetwice every day: stood in a gastly amazement by the Tombesside, as notdaring to adventure any further, or knowing perfectly, whether hewas (as yet) truly alive, or no. But when he saw the Monkes andAbbot comming, with their lighted Torches, and singing in a solemnemanner of Procession, he humbled himselfe at the Abbots feete, saying.Holy Father, by your zealous prayers (as hath bin miraculouslyrevealed to me) and the prayers of blessed S. Bennet; as also of myhonest, deare, and loving Wife, I have bin delivered from the painesof Purgatory, and brought againe to live in this world; for whichunspeakable grace and favour, most humbly I thanke the well-pleasedFates, S. Bennet, your Father-hood, and my kinde Wife, and willremember all your loves to me for ever. Blessed be the Fates, answeredthe Abbot, for working so great a wonder heere in our Monastery. Gothen my good Son, seeing the Fates have bin so gracious to thee; Go (Isay) home to thine owne house, and comfort thy kind wife, who eversince thy departure out of this life, hath lived in continuallmourning, love, cherish, and make much of her, never afflicting herhenceforth with causlesse jealousie. No I warrant you good Father,replyed Ferando; I have bin well whipt in Purgatory for such folly,and therefore I might be called a starke foole, if I should that wayoffend any more, either my loving wife, or any other.

　　The Abbot causing Miserere to be devoutly sung, sprinkling Ferandowell with Holy-water, and placing a lighted Taper in his hand, senthim home so to his owne dwelling Village: where when the Neighboursbeheld him, as people halfe frighted out of their wits, they fled awayfrom him, so scared and terrified, as if they had seene some dreadfullsight, or gastly apporition; his wife being as fearfull of him, as anyof the rest. He called to them kindly by their severall names, tellingthem, that he was newly risen out of his grave, and was a man as hehad bin before. Then they began to touch and feele him, growing intomore certaine assurance of him, perceiving him to be a living manindeede: whereupon they demanded many questions of him; and id as ifhe were become farre wiser then before, told them tydings, fromtheir long deceased Kindred and Friends, as if he had met with themall in Purgatory, reporting a thousand lyes and fables to them,which (neverthelesse) they beleeved.

　　Then he told them what the miraculous voice had said unto him,concerning the birth of another young Sonne, whom (according as he wascommanded) he caused to be named Bennet Ferando. Thus his returne tolife againe, and the daily wonders reported by him, caused no meaneadmiration in the people, with much commendation of the Abbotsholinesse, and Ferandoes happy curing his jealousie.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　COMMENDING THE GOOD JUDGEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING IN LADIES OR

　　GENTLEWOMEN, THAT ARE OF A QUICKE AND APPREHENSIVE SPIRIT

　　Juliet of Narbona, cured the King of France of a daungerous Fistula,in recompence whereof, she requested to enjoy as her husband inmarriage, Bertrand Count of Roussilion. Hee having married her againsthis will, as utterly despising her, went to Florence, where hee madelove to a young Gentlewoman. Juliet, by a queint and cunning policy,compassed the meanes (insted of his chosen new friend) to lye with herowne husband, by whom shee conceived, and had two Sonnes; whichbeing afterward made knowne unto Count Bertrand, he accepted herinto his favour againe, and loved her as his loyall and honourablewife.

　　Now there remained no more (to preserve the priviledge granted toDioneus uninfringed) but the Queene onely, to declare her Novell.Wherefore, when the discourse of Madam Lauretta was ended, withoutattending any motion to bee made for her next succeeding, with agracious and pleasing disposition, thus she began to speake. Who shalltell any Tale heereafter, to carry any hope or expectation of aliking, having heard the rare and wittie discourse of Madame Lauretta?Beleeve me, it was very advantageable to us all, that she was not thisdayes first beginner, because few or none would have had any courageto follow after her; and therefore the rest yet remaining, are themore to be feared and suspected. Neverthelesse, to avoid the breach oforder, and to claime no priviledge by my place, of not performing whatI ought to do: prove as it may, a Tale you must have, and thus Iproceed.

　　There lived sometime in the kingdome of France, a Gentleman namedIsnarde, being the Count of Roussillion: who because hee wascontinually weake, crazie, and sickly, kept a Physitian daily in hishouse, who was called Master Gerard of Narbona. Count Isnarde hadone onely Sonne, very young in yeares, yet of towardly hope, faire,comely, and of pleasing person, named Bertrand; with whom, manyother children of his age, had their education: and among them, adaughter of the fore-named Physitian, called juliet; who, even inthese tender yeares, fixed her affection upon young Bertrand, withsuch an earnest and intimate resolution, as was most admirable in soyong a Maiden, and more then many times is noted in yeares ofgreater discretion. Old Count Isnarde dying, young Bertrand fell asa Ward to the King, and being sent to Paris, remained there underhis royall custodie and protection, to no little discomfort of youngJuliet, who became greevously afflicted in minde, because she had lostthe company of Bertrand.

　　Within some few yeares after, the Physitian her Father also dyed,and then her desires grew wholly addicted, to visite Paris her selfein person, onely because she would see the young Count, awaiting buttime and opportunitie, to fit her stolne journey thither. But herkindred and friends, to whose care and trust she was committed, inregard of her rich dowrie, and being left as a fatherlesse Orphane:were so circumspect of her walks and daily behaviour, as she could notcompasse any meane; of escaping. Her yeares made her now almost fitfor marriage, which so much more encreased her love to the Count,making refusall of many woorthy husbands, and laboured by themotions of her friends and kindred, yet all denyed, they not knowingany reason for her refusalles. By this time the Count was become agallant goodly Gentleman, and able to make election of his wife,whereby her affections were the more violently enflamed, as fearingleast some other should be preferred before her, and so her hopes beutterly disappointed.

　　It was noysed abroad by common report, that the King of Francewas in a very dangerous condition, by reason of a strange swellingon his stomacke, which failing of apt and convenient curing, becamea Fistula, afflicting him daily with extraordinary paine andanguish, no Chirurgeon or Physitian being found, that could ministerany hope of healing, but rather encreased the greefe, and drove itto more vehement extreamitie, compelling the King, as dispairingutterly of all helpe, to give over any further counsell or advice.Heereof faire Juliet was wondrously joyfull, as hoping that thisaccident would prove the meanes, not onely of her journey to Paris,but if the disease were no more then she imagined; she could easilycure it, and thereby compasse Count Bertrand to be her husband.Hereupon, quickning up her wits, with remembrance of those rules ofArt, which (by long practise and experience) she had learned of herskilfull Father, she compounded certaine hearbes together, such as sheknew fitting for that kinde of infirmity, and having reduced hercompound into powder, away she rode forthwith to Paris.

　　Being there arrived, all other serious matters set aside, firstshee must needs have a sight of Count Bertrand, as being the onelySaint that caused her pilgrimage. Next she made meanes for her accesseto the King, humbly entreating his Majesty, to vouchsafe her the sightof his Fistula. When the King saw her, her modest lookes didplainely deliver, that she was a faire, comely, and discreete youngGentlewoman; wherefore, he would no longer hide it, but layed itopen to her view. When shee had seene and felt it, presently she putthe King in comfort; affirming, that she knew her selfe able to curehis Fistula, saying: Sir, if your Highnesse will referre the matter tome, without any perill of life, or any the least paine to your person,I hope (by the helpe of heaven) to make you whole and sound withineight dayes space. The King hearing her words, beganne merrily tosmile at her, saying: How is it possible for thee, being a yongMaiden, to do that which the best Physitians in Europe, are not ableto performe? I commend thy kindnesse, and will not remaineunthankefull for thy forward willingnesse: but I am fullydetermined, to use no more counsell, or to make any further triallof Physicke or Chirurgery. Whereto faire Juliet thus replyed: GreatKing, let not my skill and experience be despised, because I am young,and a Maiden; for my profession is not Physicke, neither do Iundertake the ministering thereof, as depending on mine owneknowledge; but by the gracious assistance of heaven, and some rules ofskilfull observation, which I learned of reverend Gerard of Narbonawho was my worthy Father, and a Physitian of no meane fame, all thewhile he lived.

　　At the hearing of these words, the King began somewhat to admireat her gracious carriage, and saide within himselfe. What know I,whether this Virgin is sent to me by the direction of heaven, or no?Why should I disdaine to make proofe of her skill? Her promise is,to cure me in a small times compasse, and without any paine oraffliction to me: she shall not come so farre, to returne againewith the losse of he labour, I am resolved to try her cunning, andthereon saide. Faire Virgin, if you cause me to breake my setleddetermination, and faile of curing me, what can you expect to followthereon? Whatsoever great King (quoth she) shall please you. Let me bestrongly guarded, yet not hindered, when I am to prosecute thebusinesse: and then if I do not perfectly heale you within eightdaies, let a good fire be made, and therein consume my body untoashes. But if I accomplish the cure, and set your Highnesse freefrom all further greevance, what recompence then shall remaine to me?

　　Much did the King commend the confident perswasion which she hadof her owne power, and presently replyed. Faire beauty (quoth he) inregard that thou art a Maide and unmaried, if thou keepe promise,and I finde my selfe to be fully cured: I will match thee with somesuch Gentleman in marriage, as shall be of honourable and worthyreputation, with a sufficient dowry beside. My gracious Soveraignesaide she, willing am I, and most heirtily thankfull withall, thatyour Highnesse shall bestow me in marriage: but I desire then, to havesuch a husband, as I shall desire or demand by your gracious favour,without presuming to crave any of your Sonnes, Kindred, or Alliance,or appertaining unto your Royal blood. Whereto the King gladlygranted. Young Juliet began to minister her Physicke, and within fewerdayes then her limited time, the King was sound and perfectly cured;which when he perceived, he saide unto her. Trust me vertuous Mayde,most woorthily hast thou wonne a Husband, name him, and thou shalthave him. Royall King (quoth she) then have I won the Count Bertrandof Roussillion, whom I have most entirely loved from mine Infancy, andcannot (in my soule) affect any other. Very loath was the King togrant her the young Count, but in regard of his solemne passedpromise, and his royal word engaged, which he would not by anymeanes breake; he commanded, that the Count should be sent for, andspake thus to him. Noble Count, it is not unknowne to us, that you area Gentleman of great honour, and it is our Royall pleasure, todischarge your wardship, that you may repaire home to your owne House,there to settle your affaires in such order, as you may be the readierto enjoy a Wife, which we intend to bestowe upon you. The Countreturned his Highnesse most humble thankes, desiring to know ofwhence, and what she was? It is this Gentlewoman, answered the King,who (by the helpe of Heaven) hath beene the meanes to save my life.Well did the Count know her, as having very often before seene her;and although she was very faire and amiable, yet in regard of hermeane birth, which he held as a disparagement to his Nobility inblood; he made a scorne of her, and spake thus to the King. Would yourHighnesse give me a Quacksalver to my Wife, one that deales in druggesand Physicarie? I hope I am able to bestowe my selfe much betterthen so. Why? quoth the King, wouldst thou have us breake our faith;which for the recovery of our health, we have given to this vertuousvirgin, and she will have no other reward, but onely Count Bertrand tobe her husband? Sir, replied the Count, you may dispossesse me ofall that is mine, because I am your Ward and Subject, any where elseyou may bestow me: but pardon me to tell you, that this marriagecannot be made with any liking or allowance of mine, neither will Iever give consent thereto.

　　Sir, saide the King, it is our will that it shall be so, vertuousshe is, faire and wise; she loveth thee most affectionately, andwith her mayest thou lead a more Noble life, then with the greatestLady in our Kingdome. Silent, and discontented stoode the Count, butthe King commanded preparation for the marriage; and when theappointed time was come, the Count (albeit against his will)received his wife at the Kings hand; she loving him deerly as her ownelife. When all was done, the Count requested of the King, that whatelse remained for further solemnization of the marriage, it might beperformed in his owne Country, reserving to himselfe what else heintended. Being mounted on horseback, and humbly taking their leave ofthe King, the Count would not ride home to his owne dwelling, but intoTuscany, where he heard of a warre between the Florentines and theSenesi, purposing to take part with the Florentines, to whom he waswillingly and honourably welcommed, being created Captaine of a worthyCompany, and continuing there a long while in service.

　　The poore forsaken new married Countesse, could scarsely bepleased with such dishonourable unkindnesse, yet governing herimpatience with no meane discretion, and hoping by her vertuouscarriage, to compasse the meanes of his recall: home she rode toRoussillion, where all the people received her very lovingly. Now,by reason of the Counts so long absence, all things were there farreout of order; mutinies, quarrels, and civill dissentions, havingprocured many dissolute irruptions, to the expence of much blood inmany places. But she, like a jolly stirring Lady, very wise andprovident in such disturbances, reduced all occasions to such civilityagaine, that the people admired her rare behaviour, and condemnedthe Count for his unkindnesse towards her.

　　After that the whole Country of Roussillion (by the policy andwisedome of this worthy Lady) was fully reestablished in their ancientliberties; she made choise of two discreet knights, whom she sent tothe Count her husband, to let him understand, that if in displeasureto her, hee was thus become a stranger to his owne Country: upon thereturne of his answer, to give him contentment, she would departthence, and by no meanes disturbe him. Roughly and churlishly hereplied; Let her do as she list, for I have no determination todwell with her, or neere where she is. Tell her from me, when sheshall have this Ring, which you behold heere on my finger, and a Sonnein her armes begotten by me; then will I come live with her, and beher love. The Ring he made most precious and deere account of, andnever tooke it off from his finger, in regard of an especiall vertueand property, which he well knew to be remaining in it. And thesetwo Knights, hearing the impossibility of these two strict conditions,with no other favour else to be derived from him; sorrowfully returnedbacke to their Lady, and acquainted her with this unkinde answer, asalso his unalterable determination, which well you may conceive,must needs be very unwelcome to her.

　　After she had an indifferent while considered with her selfe, herresolution became so indauntable; that she would adventure to practisesuch meanes, whereby to compasse those two apparant impossibilities,and so to enjoy the love of her husband. Having absolutely concludedwhat was to be done, she assembled all the cheefest men of thecountry, revealing unto them (in mournfull manner) what an attempt shehad made already, in hope of recovering her husbands favour, andwhat a rude answer was thereon returned. In the end, she told them,that it did not sute with her unworthinesse, to make the Count live asan exile from his owne inheritance, upon no other inducement, butonely in regard of her: wherefore, she had determined betweeneheaven and her soule, to spend the remainder of her dayes inPilgrimages and prayers, for preservation of the Counts soule andher owne; earnestly desiring them, to undertake the charge andgovernment of the Country, and signifying unto the Count, how shehad forsaken his house, and purposed to wander so farre thence, thatnever would she visit Roussillion any more. In the deliverie ofthese words, the Lords and Gentlemen wept and sighedextraordinarily, using many earnest imprecations to alter this resolvein her, but all was in vaine.

　　Having taken her sad and sorrowfull farewell of them all,accompanied onely with her Maide, and one of her Kinsmen, away shewent, attired in a Pilgrimes habit, yet well furnished with moneyand precious jewels, to avoyde all wants which might: befall her intravaile; not acquainting any one whether she went. In no place stayedshe, untill she was arrived at Florence, where happening into apoore Widdowes house, like a poore Pilgrime, she seemed well contentedtherewith. And desiring to heare some tydings of the Count, the nextday shee saw him passe by the house on horse-backe, with hiscompany. Now, albeit shee knew him well enough, yet shee demanded ofthe good old Widdow, what Gentleman he was? She made answer, that hewas a stranger there, yet a Nobleman, called Count Bertrand ofRoussillion, a very courteous Knight, beloved and much respected inthe City. Moreover, that he was farre in love with a neighbour ofhers, a young Gentlewoman, but very poore and meane in substance,yet of honest life, vertuous, and never taxed with any evill report:onely her poverty was the maine imbarment of her marriage, dwelling inhouse with her mother, who was a wise, honest, and worthy Lady.

　　The Countesse having well observed her words, and considered thereonfrom point to point; debating soberly with her owne thoughts, insuch a doubtfull case what was best to be done. When she hadunderstood which was the house, the ancient Ladies name, andlikewise her daughters, to whom her husband was now soaffectionately devoted; she made choise of a fit and convenienttime, when (in her Pilgrimes habit) secretly she went to the house.There she found the mother and daughter in poore condition, and withas poore a family: whom after she had ceremoniously saluted, shetold the old Lady, that she requested but a little conference withher. The Lady arose, and giving her kinde entertainement, they wenttogether into a withdrawing Chamber, where being both set downe, theCountesse began in this manner.

　　Madame, in my poore opinion, you are not free from the frownes ofFortune, no more then I my selfe am: but if you were so wellpleased, there is no one that can comfort both our calamities insuch manner, as you are able to do. And beleeve me answered theLady, there is nothing in the world that can be so welcome to me, ashonest comfort. The Countesse proceeding on in her former speechessaid: I have now need (good Madame) both of your trust and fidelity,whereon if I should rely, and you faile me, it will be your owneundoing as well as mine. Speake then boldly, replied the old Lady, andremaine constantly assured, that you shall no way be deceived by me.Hereupon, the Countesse declared the whole course of her love, fromthe very originall to the instant, revealing also what she was, andthe occasion of her comming thither, relating every thing soperfectly, that the Lady verily beleeved her, by some reports whichshe had formerly heard, and which mooved her the more to compassion.Now, when all circumstances were at full discovered, thus spake theCountesse.

　　Among my other miseries and misfortunes, which hath halfe brokenmy heart in the meere repetition, beside the sad and afflictingsufferance; two things there are, which if I cannot compasse tohave, all hope is quite frustrate for ever, of gaining the grace of myLord and Husband. Yet these two things may I obtaine by your helpe, ifall be true which I have heard, and you can therein best resolvemee. Since my comming to this City, it hath credibly bene told me,that the Count my husband, is deeply in love with your daughter. Ifthe Count (quoth the Ladie) love my daughter, and have a wife of hisowne, he must thinke, and so shall surely finde it, that hisgreatnesse is no priviledge for him, whereby to worke dishonour uponher poverty. But indeede, some apparances there are, and such a matteras you speake of, may be so presumed; yet so farre from a very thoughtof entertaining in her or me; as whatsoever I am able to doe, to yeeldyou any comfort and content, you shall find me therein both willingand ready: for I prize my daughters spotlesse poverty at as high arate, as he can doe the pride of his honour.

　　Madame, quoth the Countesse, most heartily I thanke you. Butbefore I presume any further on your kindnesse, let me first tell you,what faithfully I intend to do for you, if I can bring my purpose toeffect. I see that your daughter is beautifull, and of sufficientyeeres for marriage; and is debarred thereof (as I have heard) onelyby lack of a competent dowry. Wherefore Madame, in recompence of thefavour I expect from you, I will enrich her with so much ready moneyas you shall thinke sufficient to match her in the degree of honour.Poverty made the poore Lady, very well to like of such a bountifulloffer, and having a noble heart shee said: Great Countesse say,wherein am I able to do you any service, as can deserve such agracious offer? If the action be honest; without blame or scandallto my poore, yet undetected reputation, gladly I will do it; and itbeing accomplished, let the requitall rest in your owne noble nature.

　　Observe me then Madame, replied the Countesse. It is most convenientfor my purpose, that by some trusty and faithfull messenger, youshould advertise the Count my husband, that your daughter is, andshall be at his command: but that she may remaine absolutelyassured, that his love is constant to her, and above all other: sheemust entreat him, to send her (as a testimony thereof) the Ringwhich he weareth upon his little finger, albeit shee hath heard,that he loveth it deerly. If he send the Ring, you shall give it me,and afterward send him word, that your daughter is ready to accomplishhis pleasure; but, for the more safety and secrecie, he must repairehither to your house, where I being in bed insteed of your daughter,faire Fortune may so favour mee, that (unknowne to him) I may conceivewith childe. Upon which good successe, when time shall serve, havingthe Ring on my finger, and a childe in my armes begotten by him, hislove and liking may be recovered, and (by your meanes) I continue withmy Husband, as every vertuous Wife ought to doe.

　　The good old Lady imagined, that this was a matter somewhatdifficult, and might lay a blamefull imputation on her daughter.Neverthelesse, considering, what an honest office it was in her, tobee the meanes, whereby so worthy a Countesse should recover anunkinde husband, led altogether by lust, and not a jot of cordialllove; she knew the intent to be honest, the Countesse vertuous, andher promise religious, and therefore undertooke to effect it. Withinfew dayes after, verie ingeniously, and according to the instructedorder, the Ring was obtayned, albeit much against the Counts will; andthe Countesse, in sted of the Ladies vertuous daughter, was embracedby him in bed: the houre proving so auspicious, and juno being Lady ofthe ascendent, conjoyned with the witty Mercury, shee conceived of twogoodly Sonnes, and her deliverance agreed correspondently with thejust time.Thus the old Lady, not at this time onely, but at many other meetingsbesides; gave the Countesse free possession of her husbands pleasures,yet alwayes in such darke and concealed secrecie, as it was neversuspected, nor knowne by any but themselves, the Count lying withhis owne wife, and disappointed of her whom he more deerely loved.Alwayes at his uprising in the mornings (which usually was beforethe break of day, for preventing the least scruple of suspicion)many familiar conferences passed betweene them, with the gifts ofdivers faire: and costly jewels; all which the Countesse carefullykept, and perceiving assuredly, that shee was conceived with childe,shee would no longer bee troublesome to the good old Lady; but callingher aside, spake thus to her. Madame, I must needes give thankes toheaven and you, because my desires are amply accomplished, and bothtime and your deserts doe justly challenge, that I shouldaccordingly quite you before my departure. It remaineth now in yourowne power, to make what demand you please of me, which yet I will notgive you by way of reward, because that would seeme to bee base andmercenary: but onely whatsoever you shall receive of me, is inhonourable recompence of faire and vertuous deservings, such as anyhonest and well-minded Lady in the like distresse, may with goodcredit allow, and yet no prejudice to her reputation.

　　Although poverty might well have tutored the Ladies tongue,to-demand a liberall recompence for her paines; yet shee requested butan 100 pounds, as a friendly helpe towards her daughters marriage, andthat with a bashfull blushing was uttered too; yet the Countessegave her five hundred pounds, besides so many rich and costlyjewels, as amounted to a farre greater summe. So shee returned toher wonted lodging, at the aged widdowes house, where first shee wasentertained at her comming to Florence; and the good old Lady, toavoyde the Counts repairing to her house any more, departed thencesodainly with her daughter, to divers friends of hers that dwelt inthe Country, whereat the Count was much discontented; albeitafterward, he did never heare any more tidings of hir or her daughter,who was worthily married, to her Mothers great comfort.

　　Not long after, Count Bertrand was recalled home by his people:and he having heard of his wives absence, went to Roussillion somuch the more willingly. And the Countesse knowing her husbandsdeparture from Florence, as also his safe arrivall at his ownedwelling, remained still in Florence, untill the time of herdeliverance, which was of two goodly Sonnes, lively resembling thelookes of their Father, and all the perfect lineaments of his body.Perswade your selves, she was not a little carefull of theirnursing; and when she saw the time answerable to her determination,she tooke her journey (unknowne to any) and arrived with them atMontpellier, where she rested her selfe for divers dayes, after solong and wearisome a journey.

　　Upon the day of all Saints, the Count kept a solemne Feastivall, forthe assembly of his Lords, Knights, Ladies, and Gentlewomen: uponwhich Joviall day of generall rejoycing, the Countesse attired inher wonted Pilgrimes weed, repaired thither, entring into the greatHall where the Tables were readily covered for dinner. Preassingthrough the throng of people, with her two children in her armes, spresumed unto the place where the Count sate, and falling on her kneesbefore him, the teares trickling abundantly downe her cheekes, thusshe spake. Worthy Lord, I am thy poore, despised, and unfortunatewife; who, that thou mightst returne home, and not be an exile fromthine owne abiding, have thus long gone begging through the world. Yetnow at length, I hope thou wilt be so honourably-minded, as toperforme thine owne too strict imposed conditions, made to the twoKnights which I sent unto thee, and which (by thy command) I wasenjoyned to do. Behold here in mine armes, not onely one Sonne by theebegotten, but two Twins, and thy Ring beside. High time is it now,if men of honour respect their promises, and after so long and tedioustravell, I should at last be welcommed as thy true wife.

　　The Count hearing this, stoode as confounded with admiration; forfull well he knew the Ring: and both the children were so perfectlylike him, as he was confirmed to be their Father by generalljudgement. Upon his urging by what possible meanes this could bebrought to passe: the Countesse in presence of the whole assembly, andunto her eternall commendation, related the whole history, even insuch manner as you have formerly heard it. Moreover, she reportedthe private speeches in bed, uttered betweene himselfe and her,being witnessed more apparantly, by the costly jewels there openlyshewne. All which infallible proofes, proclaiming his shame, and hermost noble carriage to her husband; he confessed, that she had toldnothing but the truth in every point which she had reported.

　　Commending her admirable constancy, exceliency of wit, and sprightlycourage, in making such a bold adventure; he kissed the two sweeteboyes, and to keepe his promise, whereto he was earnestlyimportuned, by all his best esteemed friends there present, especiallythe honourable Ladies, who would have no deniall, but by forgettinghis former harsh and uncivill carriage towards her, to accept herfor ever as his lawfull wife, folding her in his armes, and sweetlykissing her divers times together, he bad her welcome to him, as hisvertuous, loyall, and most loving wife, and so (for ever after) hewould acknowledge her. Well knew hee that she had store of betterbeseeming garments in the house, and therefore requested the Ladies towalke with her to her Chamber, to uncase her of those Pilgrimes weeds,and cloath her in her owne more sumptuous garments, even those whichshee wore on her wedding day, because that was not the day of hiscontentment, but onely this; for now he confessed her to be his wifeindeede, and now he would give the king thanks for her, and now wasCount Bertrand truly married to the faire Juliet of Narbona.

　　THE THIRD DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　Alibech turns hermit, and a monk, Rustico, teaches her to put theDevil in Hell. Afterwards she is brought home, and married toNeerbale.

　　Dioneus listened attentively to the Queen's discourse, and whenshe had done and he knew that only he remained to complete the day'sentertainment, without trifling away the time or awaiting a commandfrom the Queen, thus he began.

　　Gracious ladies, it may be you have not heard how the Devil is putin Hell. Therefore, and since it will not be far off the subject ofthis day's discourse, I will tell it you. Perhaps, hearing it, you maythe better understand that albeit Love more affects gay palaces andluxurious bowers than the cabins of the poor, yet he by no meansdisdains to manifest his power even in the depths of the forest, onstark mountains and in the caves of the desert; and thus we mustacknowledge that all things wheresoever they be are subject to him.

　　Coming, then, to my story, I must tell you that in Capsa, a cityof Barbary, there dwelt aforetime a very rich man, who had amongseveral children a little daughter, fair and of a docile temper, whosename was Alibech.

　　This girl, a heathen in a place where many were Christian, usedoften to hear her neighbours extol the Christian faith and devotion tothe service of God; wherefore she asked one of them how God could bestbe served and with the least hindrance. She was told that they bestserved Him who removed themselves farthest from the things of theworld, as in particular the hermits who had withdrawn from the city tothe wilds of Thebais.

　　The simple maiden, aged perhaps some fourteen years, moved rather bya childish whim than any real vocation, set out on the morrow aloneand telling nobody to walk into the desert. So firmly was she resolvedthat after several days of hardship she reached the wilderness ofThebais. From afar she descried a little hut, and coming up to it,found there a holy man. Amazed to see such a one there, he askedwhat she came to seek. Her answer was that, aspiring towards God,she came thither to serve Him, and in the hope of finding a teacher tothat end.

　　The pious hermit, seeing her so young and fair, was afraid lestthe Devil might ensnare him; so he praised her intent, and givingher roots, wild apples and dates to eat and a draught of water,said: "Daughter, not far from here there dwells a holy man such asthou seekest: a fitter man than I. Go thou to him." And he put heron the way.

　　The second hermit advised her as the first; and faring farther shecame to the cell of a young hermit, a very pious and righteous man,whose name was Rustico. To him she repeated her mission. Willing toput his resolution to so great a test, he forebore to send her away,and took her into his cell. At nightfall he made her a bed ofpalm-leaves, and bade her lie down to rest.

　　Temptations did not long delay an assault on his constancy; andfinding it much beyond his strength to withstand them, he soon gave upthe battle, and confessed himself worsted. So putting away all saintlythoughts, prayers and mortifications, he let his mind dwell on thefreshness and beauty of his companion. From this he passed to thinkingof the best means of bringing her to his desires without giving hercause to suspect him of lewdness.Therefore, satisfying himself by a few questions that she had neverhad carnal knowledge of a man, and was indeed as innocent as sheseemed, he thought of a plan to enjoy her under colour of serving God.He began expounding to her the Devil's enmity to the Almighty, andwent on to impress upon her that the most acceptable service she couldrender to God would be to put the Devil in Hell, whereto the Lordhad condemned him.

　　The little maid asked him how this might be done. "Thou shalt soonlearn," replied Rustico, "only do as thou seest me do." Thereupon hetook off what few clothes he wore, and stood stark naked; and assoon as the girl had done likewise he fell on his knees as though topray, and made her kneel face to face with him.

　　This done, Rustico's desire was more than ever inflamed at the sightof her beauty, and the resurrection of the flesh came to pass.Seeing this, and not knowing what it meant, Alibech asked: "Rustico,what is it thou hast that thrusts itself out in front, and that I havenot?" "My daughter," quoth Rustico, "it is that same Devil of whom Ihave been telling thee. Dost thou mark him? Behold, he gives me suchsore trouble that I can hardly bear it."

　　"The Lord be praised!" said she; "for now I see that I am moreblessed than thou in that I have not this Devil."

　　Rustico retorted: "Thou sayest truly; but thou hast another thingthat I have not, and hast it in place of this."

　　"What is that?" says Alibech.

　　To this Rustico replied: "Thou hast Hell; and will tell thee mybelief that God gave it thee for the health of my soul. For, if thouwilt take pity on me for the troubling of this Devil, and suffer me toput him in Hell, thou wilt comfort me extremely, and at the sametime please and serve God in the highest measure; to which end, asthou sayest, thou art come hither."

　　All unsuspecting, the girl answered. him: "My father, since I havethis Hell, let the thing be done when thou desirest it."

　　Then Rustico said: "Bless thee, my dear daughter; let us go atonce and put him in his place, that I may be at peace."

　　So saying, he laid her on one of their rough beds, and set aboutshowing her how to shut the accursed one in his prison. The girl,who until then had no experience of putting devils in Hell, feltsome pain at this first trial of it; which made her say to Rustico:"Father, this Devil must indeed be wicked, and in very sooth anenemy of God, for he hurts Hell itself, let alone other things, whenhe is put back in it."

　　"My daughter," said Rustico, "it will not always be so." And to makesure of it, before either of them moved from the bed they put him insix times, after which the Devil hung his head and was glad to letthem be.

　　But in the succeeding days he rose up many times; and the girl,always disposing herself to subdue him, began to take pleasure inthe exercise, and to say such things as: "I see now the truth ofwhat the good folk in Capsa told me, that serving God is a delight;for I never remember doing anything that gave me as much joy andpleasure as this putting the Devil in Hell. So I think the peoplewho spend their time otherwise than in serving God must be veryfoolish."

　　Often she would come to Rustico and say: "Father, I came hither toserve God, not to stand idle. Let us go put the Devil in Hell." Andonce, when it had been done, she asked: "Rustico, why does he wantto get out of Hell? If only he would stay there as willingly as Helltakes him in and holds him, he would never want to come out at all."By thus constantly egging him on and exhorting him to God's servicethe girl so preyed upon Rustico that he shivered with cold whenanother man would have sweated. He had perforce to tell her that itwas not just to punish the Devil by putting him in Hell save when hehad lifted his head in pride; and that by God's mercy they had sochastened him that he only implored Heaven to be left in peace. Thusfor a time he silenced her.

　　But she, finding that Rustico did not call on her to put the Devilin Hell, said one day: "Even though your Devil is punished and nolonger troubles you, my Hell gives me no peace. You will do acharity if with your Devil you will quiet the raging of my Hell, aswith my Hell I tamed the pride of your Devil To these demandsRustico on a diet of herbs and water could ill respond; and he toldher that to appease Hell would need too many devils, none the lesshe would do all that in him lay. At times he could satisfy her, but soseldom that it was like feeding an elephant with peas. Therefore thegirl thought she was not serving God as well as she would like, andshe grumbled most of the time.

　　Whilst things stood thus amiss between Rustico's Devil and Alibech'sHell, for overmuch eagerness of the one part and too littleperformance of the other, a fire broke out in Capsa and burned thefather of Alibech with his children and every one of his kin, sothat Alibech became the sole heiress to his goods. Whereupon a certainNeerbale, a young man who had wasted his patrimony in high living,sought for Alibech in the belief that she was alive, and succeededin finding her before the Court had declared her father's goodsforfeit as being without an owner. Much to the relief of Rustico andagainst the girl's will, Neerbale brought her back to Capsa andmarried her, so becoming entitled in her right to a large fortune.

　　One day, when as yet Neerbale had not lain with her, some of herwomen asked how she had served God in the desert. She replied that shehad served Him by putting the Devil in Hell, and that Neerbale hadcommitted a grievous sin in taking her from such pious work. Then theyasked: "How is the Devil put in Hell?" To which the girl answered withwords and gestures showing how it had been done. The women laughedso heartily that they have not done laughing yet, and said to her:"Grieve not, my child; that is done as well here. Neerbale willserve God right well with thee in this way."

　　As one repeated the words to another throughout the town, itbecame a familiar saying that the most acceptable of all services toGod is to put the Devil in Hell. The saying has crossed the sea andbecome current among us, as it still is.

　　Wherefore, young ladies, I beseech you if you would deserve Heaven'sgrace, lend yourselves to the putting of the Devil in Hell; for itis a thing beloved of God, pleasing to the participants, and onefrom which much good comes and ensues.

　　A thousand times and more were the chaste ladies moved to laughterby Dioneus's novel, so much were his phrases to their liking. Andthe Queen perceiving that as his tale was ended, her office hadexpired, took the crown of laurel from her head and graciouslyplaced it on the head of Philostratus, saying: "Now we shall seewhether the wolf will rule the sheep better than the sheep ruled thewolves." At this Philostratus laughed, and retorted: "If I had my way,the wolves would have taught the sheep to put the Devil in Hell, noless well than Rustico taught Alibech. Since we did not, call us notwolves, for ye were no sheep. Howbeit, I will reign as best I may,seeing ye have laid the trust on me."

　　Neiphila cried out: "Mark this, Philostratus; in trying to teachus you might have had such a lesson as Masetto di Lamporechio had ofthe nuns, and recovered your speech just as your bare bones hadlearned to whistle without a master." Finding himself thus evenlymatched, Philostratus ceased his pleasantries; and beginning toconsider on the charge committed to his care, called the Master of thehoushold, to know in what estate all matters were, because where anydefect appeared, every thing might be the sooner remedied, for thebetter satisfaction of the company, during the time of hisauthority. Then returning backe to the assembly, thus he began. LovelyLadies, I would have you to know, that since the time of ability inme, to distinguish betweene good and evill, I have alwayes benesubject (perhaps by the meanes of some beauty heere among us) to theproud and imperious dominion of love, with expression of all duty,humility, and most intimate desire to please yet all hath prooved tono purpose, but still I have bin rejected for some other, whereby mycondition hath falne from ill to worse, and so still it is likely,even to the houre: of my death. In which respect, it best pleaseth me,that our conferences to morrow, shall extend to no other argument, bitonly such cases as are most conformable to my calamity, namely ofsuch, whose love hath had unhappy ending, because I await no otherissue of mine; nor willingly would I be called by any other name,but only, the miserable and unfortunate Lover.

　　Having thus spoken, he arose againe; granting leave to the rest,to recreate themselves till supper time. The Garden was very faire andspacious, affoording, large limits for their severall walkes; theSun being already so low descended, that it could not be offensiveto any one, the Connies, Kids, and young Hindes skipping every whereabout them, to their no meane, pleasure and contentment, Dioneus andFiammetta, sate singing together, of Messire Guiglielmo, and theLady of Vertur. Philomena and Pamphilus playing at the Chesse, allsporting themselves as best they pleased. But the houre of Supperbeing come, and the Tables covered about the faire fountaine, theysate downe and supt in most loving manner. Then Philostratus, not toswerve from the course which had beene observed by the Queenesbefore him, so soone as the Tables were taken away, gave commaund thatMadam Lauretta should beginne the dance, and likewise to sing aSong. My gracious Lord (quoth she) I can skill of no other Songs,but onely a peece of mine owne, which I have already learned by heart,and may well beseeme this assembly: if you please to allow of that,I am ready to performe it with all obedience. Lady, replyed theKing, you your selfe being so faire and lovely, so needs must bewhatsoever commeth from you, therefore let us heare such as youhave. Madam Lauretta, giving enstruction to the Chorus prepared, andbegan in this manner.

　　THE SONG

　　No soule so comfortlesse,

　　Hath more cause to expresse,

　　Like woe and heavinesse,

　　As I poore amorous Maide.

　　He that did forme the Heavens and every Starre,

　　Made me as best him pleased,

　　Lovely and gracious, no Element at jarre,

　　Or else in gentle breasts to moove sterne Warre,

　　But to have strifes appeased

　　Where Beauties eye should make the deepest scarre.

　　And yet when all things are confest,

　　Never was any soule distrest,

　　Like my poore amorous Maide.

　　No soule so comfortlesse, etc.

　　There was a time, when once I was held deare,

　　Blest were those happy dayes:

　　Numberlesse Love suites whispred in mine eare,

　　All of faire hope, but none of desperate feare;

　　And all sung Beauties praise.

　　Why should blacke cloudes obscure so bright a cleare?

　　And why should others swimme in joy,

　　And no heart drowned in annoy,

　　Like mine poore amorous Maide?

　　No soule so comfortlesse, etc.

　　Well may I curse that sad and dismall day,

　　When in unkinde exchange;

　　Another Beauty did my hopes betray,

　　And stole my dearest Love from me away:

　　Which I thought very strange,

　　Considering vowes were past, and what else may

　　Assure a loyall Maidens trust.

　　Never was Lover so unjust,

　　Like mine poore amorous Maide.

　　No soule so comfortlesse, etc.

　　Come then kinde Death, and finish all my woes,

　　Thy helpe is now the best.

　　Come lovely Nymphes, lend hands mine eyes to close,

　　And let him wander wheresoere he goes,

　　Vaunting of mine unrest;

　　Beguiling others by his treacherous showes.

　　Grave on my Monument,

　　No true love was worse spent,

　　Then mine poore amorous Maide.

　　No soule so comfortlesse, etc.

　　So did Madam Lauretta finish her Song, which being well observedof them all, was understood by some in divers kinds: some alludingit one way, and others according to their owne apprehensions, butall consenting that both it was an excellent Ditty, well devised,and most sweetly sung. Afterward, lighted Torches being brought,because the Stars had already richly spangled all the heavens, and thefit houre of rest approaching: the King commanded them all to theirChambers, where we meane to leave them untill the next morning.

　　THE FOURTH DAY

　　WHEREIN ALL THE SEVERALL DESCOURSES, ARE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF

　　HONOURABLE PHILSTRATUS: AND CONCERNING SUCH

　　PERSONS, WHOSE LOVES HAVE HAD SUCCESSELESSE ENDING

　　Most worthy Ladies, I have alwayes heard, as well by the sayingsof the judecious, as also by mine owne observation and reading, thatthe impetuous and violent windes of envy, do sildome blow turbulently,but on the highest Towers and tops of the trees most eminentlyadvanced. Yet (in mine opinion) I have found my selfe much deceived;because, by striving with my very uttermost endeavour, to shunne theoutrage of those implacable winds; I have laboured to go, not onely byplaine and even pathes but likewise through the deepest vallies. Asvery easily may be seene and observed in the reading of these fewsmall Novels, which I have written not only in our vulgar Florentineprose, without any ambitious title: but also in a most humble stile,so low and gentle as possibly I could. And although I have bene rudelyshaken, yea, almost halfe unrooted, by the extreame agitation of thoseblustering winds, and torne in peeces by that base back-biter, Envy:yet have I not (for all that) discontinued, or broken any part of mineintended enterprize. Wherefore, I can sufficiently witnesse (by mineowne comprehension) the saying so much observed by the wise, to bemost true: That nothing is without Envy in this world, but miseryonely.

　　But what shall I say to them, who take so great compassion on mypovertie, as they advise me to get some thing, whereon to make myliving? Assuredly, I know not what to say in this case, except bydue consideration made with my selfe, how they would answer me, ifnecessitie should drive me to crave kindnesse of them;questionlesse, they would then say: Goe, seeke comfort among thyfables and follies.

　　But now it is time (bright beauties) to returne whence we parted,and to follow our former order begun, because it may seeme we havewandered too farre. By this time the Sun had chased the Starre-lightfrom the heavens, and the shadie moisture from the ground, whenPhilostratus the King being risen, all the company arose likewise.When being come into the goodly Garden, they spent the time invarietie of sports, dining where they had supt the night before. Andafter that the Sunne was at his highest, and they had refreshedtheir spirits with a little slumbering, they sate downe (accordingto custome) about the faire Fountaine. And then the King commandedMadam Fiammettal that she should give beginning to the dayes Novels:when she, without any longer delaying, began:

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED THE POWER OF LOVE, AND THEIR CRUILTY JUSTLY

　　REPREHENDED, WHO IMAGE TO MAKE THE VIGOUR THEREOF

　　CEASE, BY ABUSING OR KILLING ONE OF THE LOVERS

　　Tancrede, Prince of Salerne, caused the amorous friend of hisdaughter to bee slaine, and sent her his heart in a cup of Gold: whichafterwards she steeped in an impoysoned water, and then drinking it,so dyed.

　　Our King (most Noble and vertuous Ladies) hath this day given us asubject, very rough and stearne to discourse on, and so much therather, if we consider, that we are come hither to be merry andpleasant, where sad Tragicall reports are no way suteable, especially,by reviving the teares of others, to bedew our owne cheekes withall.Nor can any such argument be spoken of, without moving compassion bothin the reporters, and hearers. But (perhaps) it was his Highnessepleasure, to moderate the delights which we have already had. Orwhatsoever else hath provoked him thereto, seeing it is not lawfullfor me, to alter or contradict his appointment; I will recount anaccident very pittifull, or rather most unfortinate, and well worthyto be graced with bur teares.

　　Tancrede, Prince of Salerne (which City, before the Consulles ofRome held dominion in that part of Italy, stoode free, and thence(perchance) tooke the moderne title of a Principality was a veryhumane Lord, and of ingenious nature; if, in his elder yeeres, hehad not soiled his hands in the blood of Lovers, especially one ofthem, being both neere and deere unto him. So it fortuned, that duringthe whole life time of this Prince, he had but one onely daughter(albeit it had beene much better, if he had had at all) whom he sochoisely loved and esteemed, as never was any childe more deerelyaffected of a Father: and so farre extended his over-curious respectof her, as he would seldome admit her to be forth of his sight;neither would he suffer her to marry, although she had outstept (bydivers yeeres) the age meete for marriage.

　　Neverthelesse, at length, he matched her with the Sonne to theDuke of Capua, who lived no long while with her; but left her in awiddowed estate, and then she returned home to her father againe.

　　This Lady, had all the most absolute perfections, both of favour andfeature, as could be wished in any woman, young, queintly disposed,and of admirable understanding, more (perhappes) then was requisite inso weake a body. Continuing thus in Court with the King her Father,who loved her beyond all his future hopes; like a Lady of great andglorious magnificence, she lived in all delights and pleasure. Shewell perceiving, that her Father thus exceeding in his affection toher, had no minde at all of re-marrying her, and holding it mostimmodest in her, to solicite him with any such suite: concluded in hermindes private consultations, to make choise of some one especiallfriend or favourite (if Fortune would prove so furtherous to her) whomshe might acquaint secretly, with her sober, honest, and familiarpurposes. Her Fathers Court being much frequented, with plentifullaccesse of brave Gentlemen, and others of inferiour quality, ascommonly the Courts ofKings and Princes are, whose carriage and demeanor she veryheedfully observed. There was a young Gentleman among all the rest,a servant to her Father, and named Cuiscardo, a man not derived fromany great descent by blood, yet much more Noble by vertue andcommandable behaviour, then appeared in any of the other, none pleasedher opinion, like as he did; so that by often noting his parts andperfections, her affections being but a glowing sparke at first,grew like a Bavin to take Rame, yet kept so closely as possibly shecould; as Ladies are warie enough in their love.

　　The young Gentleman, though poore, being neither blocke nor dullard,perceived what he made no outward shew of, and understood himselfeso sufficiently, that holding it no meane happinesse to be affected byher, he thought it very base and cowardly in him, if he should notexpresse the like to her againe. So loving mutually (yet secretly)in this maner, and she coveting nothing more, then to have privateconference with him, yet not daring to trust any one with so importanta matter; at length she devised a new cunning stratageme, tocompasse her longing desire, and acquaint him with her privatepurpose, which proved to be in this manner. She wrote a Letter,concerning what was the next day to be done, for their secretmeeting together; and conveying it within the joynt of an hollow Cane,in jesting manner threw it to Guiscardo, saying; Let your man make useof this, insteed of a paire of bellowes, when he meaneth to makefire in your Chamber. Guiscardo taking up the Cane, and consideringwith himselfe, that neither was it given, or the wordes thus spoken,but doubtlesse on some important occasion: went unto his lodgingwith the Cane, where viewing it respectively, he found it to be cleft,and opening it with his knife, found there the written Letterenclosed.

　　After he had reade it, and well considered on the service thereinconcerned; he was the most joyfull man of the world, and began tocontrive his aptest meanes, for meeting with his gracious Mistresse,and according as she had given him direction. In a corner of the KingsPalace, it being seated on a rising hill, a cave had long beene madein the body of the same hill, which received no light into it, butby a small spiracle or vent-loope, made out ingeniously on the hilsside. And because it had not beene a long time frequented, by theaccesse of any body, that vent-light was over-growne with briars andbushes, which almost engirt it round about. No one could descendinto this cave or vault, but only by a secret paire of staires,answering to a lower Chamber of the Palace, and very neere to thePrincesse lodging, as being altogether at her command, by meanes ofa strong barred and defensible doore, whereby to mount or descend ather pleasure. And both the cave it selfe, as also the degreesconducting downe into it, were now so quite worne out of memory (inregard it had not beene visited by any one in long time before) asno man remembred that there was any such thing.

　　But Love, from whose bright discerning eies, nothing can be soclosely concealed, but at the length it commeth to light, had madethis amorous Lady mindefull thereof, and because she would not bediscovered in her intention, many dayes together, her soule becameperplexed; by what meanes that strong doore might best be opened,before she could compasse to performe it. But after that she had foundout the way, and gone downe her selfe alone into the cave; observingthe loope-light and had made it commodious for her purpose, she gaveknowledge thereof to Guiscardo, to have him devise an apt course forhis descent, acquainting him truly with the height, and how farre itwas distant from the ground within. After he had found thesouspirall in the hils side, and given it a larger entrance for hissafer passage; he provided a Ladder of cords, with steppessufficient for his descending and ascending, as also a wearing sutemade of leather, to keepe his skinne unscrached of the thornes, and toavoyde all suspition of his resorting thither. In this manner wenthe to the saide loope-hole the night following, and having fastenedthe one end of his corded ladder, to the strong stumpe of a tree beingby it; by meanes of the saide ladder, descended downe into the cave,and there attended the comming of his Lady.

　　She, on the morrow morning, pretending to her waiting woman, thatshe was scarsly well, and therefore would not be diseased the mostpart of that day; commanded them to leave her alone in her Chamber,and not to returne untill she called for them, locking the doore herselfe for better security. Then opened she the doore of the cave,and going downe the staires, found there her amorous friend Guiscardo,whom she saluting with a chaste and modest kisse; causing him toascend up the stayres with her into her Chamber. This long desired,and now obtained meeting, caused the two deerely affected Lovers, inkinde discourse of amorous argument (without incivill or rudedemeanor) to spend there the most part of that day, to their heartsjoy and mutuall contentment. And having concluded on their oftenmeeting there, in this cunning and concealed sort; Guiscardo wentdowne into the cave againe, the Princesse making the doore fastafter him, and then went forth among her Women. So in the nightseason, Guiscardo ascended up againe by his Ladder of cords, andcovering the loopehole with brambles and bushes, returned (unseeneof any) to his owne lodging: the cave being afterward guilty oftheir often meeting there in this manner.

　　But Fortune, who hath alwayes bin a fatall enemy to lovers stolnefelicities, became envious of their thus secret meeting, and overthrew(in an instant) all their poore happinesse, by an accident mostspightfull and malicious. The King had used divers dayes before, afterdinner time, to resort all alone to his daughters Chamber, thereconversing with her in most loving manner. One unhappy day amongst therest, when the Princesse, being named Ghismonda, was sporting in herprivate Garden among her Ladies, the King (at his wonted time) went tohis daughters Chamber, being neither heard or seene by any. Norwould he have his daughter called from her pleasure, but finding thewindowes fast shut, and the Curtaines close drawne about the bed; hesate downe in a chaire behind it, and leaning his head upon the bed,his body being covered with the curtaine, as if he hid himselfepurposely; he mused on so many matters, at last he fell fast asleepe.

　　It hath bin observed as an ancient Adage, that when disasters areordained to any one, commonly they prove to be inevitable, as pooreGhismonda could witnesse too well. For while the King thus slept,she having (unluckily) appointed another meeting with Guiscardo,left hir Gentlewomen in the Garden, and stealing softly into herChamber, having made all fast and sure, for being descried by anyperson: opened the doore to Guiscardo, who stood there ready on thestaire-head, awaiting his entrance; and they sitting downe on thebed side (according as they were wont to do) began their usuallkinde of conference againe, with sighes and loving kisses mingledamong them. It chanced that the King awaked, and both hearing andseeing this familiarity of Guiscardo with his Daughter, he becameextreamly confounded with greefe thereat. Once he intended, to cry outfor have them both there apprehended; but he helde it a part ofgreater wisedome, to sit silent still, and (if he could) to keepehimselfe so closely concealed: to the end, that he might the moresecretly, and with farre lesse disgrace to himselfe, performe whathe had rashly intended to do.

　　The poore discovered Lovers, having ended their amorousinterparlance, without suspition of the Kings being so neere inperson, or any else, to betray their overconfident trust; Guiscardodescended againe into the Cave, and she leaving the Chamber,returned to her women in the Garden; all which Tancrede too wellobserved, and in a rapture of fury, departed (unseene) into his ownelodging. The same night, about the houre of mens first sleepe, andaccording as he had given order; Guiscardo was apprehended, even as hewas comming forth of the loope-hole, and in his homely leather habite.Very closely was he brought before the King, whose heart was swolne sogreat with griefe, as hardly was he able to speake: notwithstanding,at the last he began thus. Guiscardo . cardo, the love and respect Ihave used towards thee, hath not deserved the shamefull wrong whichthou hast requited me withall, and as I have seene with mine owne eyesthis day. Whereto Guiscardo could answer nothing else, but onely this:Alas my Lord! Love is able to do much more, then either you, or I.Whereupon, Tancrede commanded, that he should be secretly wellguarded, in a neere adjoyning Chamber, and on the next day,Ghismonda having (as yet) heard nothing hereof, the Kings braine beinginfinitely busied and troubled, after dinner, and as he often had usedto do: he went to his daughters Chamber, where calling for her, andshutting the doores closely to them, the teares trickling downe hisaged white beard, thus he spake to her.

　　Ghismonda, I was once grounded in a setled perswasion, that I truelyknew thy vertue, and honest integrity of life; and this beleefecould never have beene altred in mee, by any sinister reportswhatsoever, had not mine eyes seene, and mine eares heard thecontrary. Nor did I so much as conceive a thought either of thineaffection, or private conversing with any man, but onely he that wasto be thy husband. But now, I my selfe being able to avouch thy folly,imagine what an heart-breake this will be to me, so long as liferemaineth in this poore, weake, and aged body. Yet, if needes thoumust have yeelded to this wanton weaknesse, I would thou hadst madechoise of a man, answerable to thy birth and Nobility: whereas onthe contrary, among so many worthy spirits as resort to my Court, thoulikest best to converse with that silly young man Guiscardo, one ofvery meane and base descent, and by me (even for Gods sake)

　　from his very youngest yeares, brought up to this instant in myCourt; wherein thou hast given me much affliction of minde, and sooverthrowne my senses, as I cannot well imagine how I should dealewith thee. For him, whom I have this night caused to be surprized,even as he came forth of your close contrived conveyance, anddetaine as my prisoner, I have resolved how to proceed with him: butconcerning thy selfe, mine oppressions are so many and violent, as Iknow not what to say of thee. e. way, thou hast meerly murthered theunfeigned affection I bare thee, as never any father could expressemore to his childe: and then againe, thou hast kindled a most justindignation in me, by thine immodest and wilfull folly, and whereasNature pleadeth pardon for the one, yet justice standeth up againstthe other, and urgeth cruell severity against thee: neverthelesse,before I will determine upon any resolution, I come purposely first toheare thee speake, and what thou canst say for thy selfe, in a badcase, so desperate and dangerous.

　　Having thus spoken, he hung downe the head in his bosome, weeping asaboundantly, as if he had beene a childe severely disciplinde. Onthe other side, Ghismonda hearing the speeches of her Father, andperceiving withall, that not onely her secret love was discovered, butalso Guiscardo was in close prison, the matter which most of all didtorment her; she fell into a very strange kinde of extasie, scorningteares, and entreating tearmes, such as feminine frailety arealwayes aptest unto: but rather, with height of courage, controulingfeare or servile basenesse, and declaring invincible fortitude inher very lookes, she concluded with her selfe, rather then to urge anyhumble perswasions, she would lay her life downe at the stake. Forplainely she perceived, that Guiscardo already was a dead man inLaw, and death was likewise welcome to her, rather then thedeprivation of her Love; and therefore, not like a weeping woman, oras checkt by the offence committed, but carelesse of any harmehappening to her: stoutely and couragiously, not a teare appearingin her eye, or her soule any way to be perturbed, thus she spake toher Father.

　　Tancrede, to denie what I have done, or to entreate any favourfrom you, is now no part of my disposition: for as the one canlittle availe me, so shall not the other any way advantage me.Moreover, I covet not that you should extend any clemency or kindnesseto me, but by my voluntary confession of the truth do intend (first ofall) to defend mine honour, with reasons sound, good, andsubstantiall, and then vertuously pursue to full effect, thegreatnesse of my minde and constant resolution. True it is, that Ihave loved, and still do, honourable Guiscardo, purposing the likeso long as I shall live, which will be but a small while: but if it bepossible to continue the same affection after death, it is for evervowed to him onely. Nor did mine owne womanish weaknesse so muchthereto induce me, as the matchlesse vertues shining clearly inGuiscardo, and the little respect you had of marrying me againe. Whyroyall Father, you cannot be ignorant, that you being composed offlesh and blood, have begotten a Daughter of the selfe samecomposition, and not made of stone or iron. Moreover, you ought toremember (although now you are farre stept in yeeres) what the Lawesof youth are, and with what difficulty they are to be contradicted.Considering withall, that albeit (during the vigour of your best time)you evermore were exercised in Armes; yet you should likewiseunderstand, that negligence and idle delights, have mighty power,not onely in young people, but also in them of greatest yeares.

　　I being then made of flesh and blood, and so derived from yourselfe; having had also so little benefit of life, that I am yet in thespring, and blooming time of my blood: by either of these reasons, Imust needs be subject to naturall desires, wherein such knowledge as Ihave once already had, in the estate of my marriage, perhaps mightmove a further intelligence of the like delights, according to thebetter ability of strength, which exceeding all capacity ofresistance, induced a second motive to affection, answerable to mytime and youthfull desires, and so (like a yong woman) I became cameagaine; yet did I strive, even with all my utmost might, and bestvertuous faculties abiding in me, no way to disgrace either you ormy selfe, as (in equall censure) yet have I not done. But Nature isabove all humane power, and Love commanded by Nature, hath prevailedfor Love, joyning with Fortune: in meere pitty and commiseration of myextreame wrong, I found them both most benigne and gracious,teaching mee a way secret enough, whereby I might reach the heightof my desires, howsoever you became instructed, or (perhaps) foundit out by accident; so it was, and I deny it not.

　　Nor did I make election of Guiscardo by chance, or rashly, as manywomen doe, but by deliberate counsell in my soule, and most matureadvise; I chose him above all other, and having his honestharmelesse conversation, mutually we enjoyed our hearts contentment.Now it appeareth, that I have not offended but by love; in imitationof vulgar opinion, rather then truth: you seeke to reprove mebitterly, alleaging no other maine argument for your anger, butonely my not choosing a Gentleman, or one more worthy. Wherein it ismost evident, that you do not so much checke my fault, as theordination of Fortune, who many times advanceth men of meanestesteeme, and abaseth them of greater merit. But leaving thisdiscourse, let us looke into the originall of things, wherein we arefirst to observe, that from one masse or lumpe of flesh, both we,and all other received our flesh, and one Creator hath created allthings; yea, all creatures, equally in their forces and faculties, andequall likewise in their vertue: which vertue was the first thatmade distinction of birth and equality, in regard, that such as havethe most liberall portion thereof, and performed actions theretoanswerable, were thereby tearmed noble; all the rest remainingunnoble: now although contrary use did afterward hide and concealethis Law, yet was it not therefore banished from Nature or goodmanners. In which respect, whosoever did execute all his actions byvertue, declared himselfe openly to be noble; and he that tearmedhim otherwise, it was an errour in the miscaller, and not in theperson so wrongfully called; as the very same priviledge is yet infull force among us at this day.

　　Cast an heedfull eye then (good Father) upon all your Gentlemen, andadvisedly examine their vertues, conditions, and manner ofbehaviour. On the other side, observe those parts remaining inGuiscardo: and then if you will Judge truly, and without affection,you will confesse him to be most Noble, and that all your Gentlemen(in respect of him) are but base Groomes and villaines. His vertuesand excelling perfections, I never credited from the report orjudgement of any person; but onely by your speeches, and mine owneeyes as true witnesses. Who did ever more commend Guiscardo, extollingall those singularities in him, most requisite to be in an honestvertuous man; then you your selfe have done? Nor neede you to besorry, or ashamed of your good opinion concerning him: for if mineeyes have not deceived my judgement, you never gave him the least partof praise, but I have knowne much more in him, then ever your wordswere able to expresse: wherefore, if I have beene any way deceived,truly the deceit proceeded onely from you. How wil you then maintaine,that I have throwne my liking on a man of base condition? In troth(Sir) you cannot. Perhaps you will alledge, that he is but meane andpoore; I confesse it, and surely it is to your shame, that you havenot bestowne place of more preferment, on a man so honest and welldeserving, and having bene so long a time your servant.Neverthelesse poverty impayreth not any part of noble Nature, butwealth hurries into horrible confusions. Many Kings and greatPrinces have heeretofore beene poore, when divers of them that havedelved into the earth, and kept Flockes in the field, have beeneadvanced to riches, and exceeded the other in wealth.

　　Now, as concerning your last doubt, which most of all afflictethyou, namely, how you shall deale with me; boldly rid your braine ofany such disturbance; for if you have resolved now in your extremityof yeres, to doe that which your younger dayes evermore despised, Imeane, to become cruell; use your utmost cruelty against me: for I wilnever intreat you to the contrary, because I am the sole occasion ofthis offence, if it doe deserve the name of an offence. And this Idare assure you, that if you deale not with me, as you have donealready, or intend to Guiscardo, mine owne hands shall act as much:and therfore give over your teares to women; and if you purpose tobe cruel, let him and me in death drinke both of one cup, at leastif you imagine that we have deserved it.

　　The King knew well enough the high spirit of his Daughter, but yet(neverthelesse) he did not beleeve, that her words would proveactions, or she do as she said. And therefore parting from her, andwithout intent of using any cruelty to her, concluded, by quenchingthe heat of another to coole the fiery rage of her distemper,commanding two of his follow (who had the custody of Guiscardo) thatwithout any rumour or noise at all, they should strangle him the nightensuing, and taking the heart forth of his body, to bring it to him,which they performed according to their charge. On the next day, theKing called for a goodly standing cup of Gold, wherein he put theheart of Guiscardo, sending it by one of his most familiar servants tohis Daughter, with command also to use these words to her. ThyFather hath sent thee this present, to comfort thee with that thingwhich most of all thou affectest, even as thou hast comforted him withthat which he most hated.

　　Ghismonda, nothing altered from her cruell deliberation, after herFather was departed from her, caused certaine poisonous roots andhearbes to be brought her, which shee (by distillation) made a waterof, to drinke sodainly, whensoever any crosse accident should comefrom her Father; whereupon, when the Messenger from her Father haddelivered her the present, and uttered the words as he was commaunded:shee tooke the Cup, and looking into it with a setled countenance,by sight of the heart, and effect of the message, she knew certainely,that was the heart of Guiscardo; then looking stearnely on theservant, thus she spake unto him. My honest friend, it is no more thenright and justice, that so worthy a heart as this is, should haveany worser grave then gold, wherein my Father hath dealt mostwisely. So, lifting the heart up to her mouth, and sweetly kissing it,she proceeded thus. In all things, even till this instant, (beingthe utmost period of my life) I have evermore found my Fathers lovemost effectuall to me; but now it appeareth farre greater, then at anytime heretofore: and therefore from my mouth, thou must deliver himthe latest thankes that ever I shall give him, for sending me suchan honourable present.

　　These words being ended, holding the Cup fast in her hand, andlooking seriously upon the heart, she began againe in this manner.Thou sweete entertainer of all my dearest delights, accursed be hiscruelty, that causeth me thus to see thee with my corporall eyes, itbeing sufficient enough for me, alwayes to behold thee with thesight of my soule. Thou hast runne thy race, and as Fortuneordained, so are thy dayes finished: for as all flesh hath anending; so hast thou concluded, albeit too soone, and before thy duetime. The travalles and miseries of this World, have now no more tomeddle with thee, and thy very heaviest enemy hath bestowed such agrave on thee, as thy greatnesse in vertue worthily deserveth; nownothing else is wanting, wherewith to beautifie thy Funerall, but onlyher sighes and teares, that was so deare unto thee in thy life time.And because thou mightest the more freely enjoy them, see how mymercilesse Father (on his owne meere motion) hath sent thee to me; andtruly I will bestow them frankly on thee, though once I hadresolved, to die with drie eyes, and not shedding one teare,dreadlesse of their utmost malice towards me.

　　And when I have given thee the due oblation of my teares, mysoule, which sometime thou hast kept most carfully, shall come to makea sweet conjunction with thine: for in what company else can Itravaile more contentedly, and to those unfrequented silent shades,but onely in thine? As yet am sure it is present here, in this Cupsent me by my Father, as having a provident respect to the place,for possess' of our equall and mutuall pleasures; because thy souleaffecting mine so truly, cannot walke alone, without his dearecompanion.

　　Having thus finished her complaint, even as if her bead had beenconverted into a well spring of water, so did teares abundantly flowfrom her faire eyes, kissing the heart of Guiscardo infinite times.All which while, her women standing by her, neither knew what heart itwas, nor to what effect her speeches tended: but being moved tocompassionate teares, they often demanded (albeit in vaine) theoccasion of her sad complaining, comforting her to their utmost power.When she was not able to weepe any longer, wiping her eyes, andlifting up her head, without any signe of the least dismay, thus shespake to the heart.

　　Deare heart, all my duty is performed to thee, and nothing nowremaineth uneffected; but onely breathing my last, to let my ghostaccompany thine.

　　Then calling for the glasse of water, which she had readily preparedthe day before, and powring it upon the heart lying in the Cup,couragiously advancing it to her mouth, she dranke it up every drop;which being done, she lay downe upon her bed, holding her Lovers heartfast in her hand, and laying it so neere to her owne as she could. Nowalthough her women knew not what water it was, yet when they had seeneher to quaffe it off in that manner, they sent word to the King, whomuch suspecting what had happened, went in all haste to hisDaughters Chamber, entring at the very instant, when she was laideupon her bed; beholding her in such passionate pangs, with tearesstreaming downe his reverend beard, he used many kinde words tocomfort her: when boldly thus she spake unto him. Father (quoth she)well may you spare these teares, because they are unfitting for you,and not any way desired by me; who but your selfe, hath seene anyman to mourne for his owne wilfull offence. Neverthelesse, if butthe least jot of that love do yet abide in you, whereof you havemade such liberall profession to me; let me obtaine this my verylast request, to wit, that seeing I might not privately enjoy thebenefit of Guiscardoes love, and while he lived, let yet (in death)one publike grave containe both our bodies, that death may affoord us,what you so cruelly in life denied us.

　　Extremity of griefe and sorrow, withheld his tongue from returningany answer, and she perceiving her end approaching, held the heartstill closer to her owne bare brest, saying; Here Fortune, receive twotrue hearts latest oblation; for, in this manner are we comming tothee. So closing her eyes, all sense forsooke her, life leaving herbody breathlesse. Thus ended the haplesse love of Guiscardo, andGhismonda, for whose sad disaster, when the King had mournedsufficiently, and repented fruitlesly; he caused both their bodiesto be honourably embalmed, and buried in a most royall Monument; notwithout generall sorrow of the subjects of Salerne.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　REPREHENDING THE LEWD LIVES OF DISSEMBLING HYPOCRITES; AND

　　CHECKING THE ARROGANT PRIDE OF VAINE-HEADED WOMEN

　　Fryar Albert made a young Venetian Gentlewoman beleeve, that GodCupid was falne in love with her, and he resorted oftentimes unto her,in the disguise of the same God. Afterward, being frighted by theGentlewomans kindred and friends, he cast himselfe out of herChamber window, and was bidden in a poore mans House; on the dayfollowing, in the shape of a wilde or savage man, he was broughtupon the Rialto of Saint Marke, and being there publikely knowne bythe Brethren of his Order, he was committed to Prison.

　　The Novell recounted by Madam Fiammetta, caused teares many times inthe eyes of all the company; but it being finished, the King shewing astearne countenance, saide; I should have much commended the kindnesseof fortune, if in the whole course of my life, I had tasted theleast moity of that delight, which Guiscardo received by conversingwith faire Ghismonda. Nor neede any of you to wonder thereat, or howit can be otherwise, because hourely I feele a thousand dyingtorments, without enjoying any hope of ease or pleasure: but referringmy fortunes to their owne poore condition, it is my will, that MadamPampinea proceed next in the argument of successelesse love, accordingas Madam Fiammetta hath already begun, to let fall more dew-drops onthe fire of mine afflictions. Madam Pampinea perceiving what a taskewas imposed on her, knew well (by her owne disposition) theinclination of the company, whereof shee was more respective then ofthe Kings command: wherefore, chusing rather to recreate theirspirits, then to satisfie the Kings melancholy humour; shedetermined to relate a Tale of mirthfull matter, and yet to keepewithin compasse of the purposed Argument It hath bene continually usedas a common Proverbe; that a bad man taken and reputed to be honestand good, may commit many evils, yet neither credited, or suspected:which proverbe giveth me very ample matter to speake of, and yet notvarying from our intention, concerning the hypocrisie of somereligious persons, who having their garments long and large, theirfaces made artificially pale, their language meeke and humble to getmens goods from them; yet sowre, harsh and stearne enough, in checkingand controuling other mens errours, as also in urging others togive, and themselves to take, without any other hope or meanes ofsalvation. Nor doe they endeavour like other men, to worke out theirsoules health with feare and trembling; but, even as if they were soleowners, Lords, and possessors of Paradice, will appoint to every dyingperson, place (there) of greater or lesser excellency, according asthey thinke good, or as the legacies left by them are in quantity,whereby they not onely deceive themselves, but all such as give creditto their subtile perswasions. And were it lawfull for me, to makeknowne no more then is meerely necessary; I could quickly discloseto simple credulous people, what craft lieth concealed under theirholy habites: and I would wish, that their lies and deluding shouldspeed with them, as they did with a Franciscane Friar, none of theyounger Novices, but one of them of greatest reputation, and belongingto one of the best Monasteries in Venice. Which I am the ratherdesirous to report, to recreate your spirits, after your teares forthe death of faire Ghismonda.

　　Sometime (Honourable Ladies) there lived in the City of Imola, a manof most lewd and wicked life; named, Bertho de la messa, whoseshamelesse deedes were so well knowne to all the Citizens, and wonsuch respect among them; as all his lies could not compasse anybeleefe, no, not when he delivered a matter of sound truth. Wherefore,perceiving that his lewdnesse allowed him no longer dwelling there;like a desperate adventurer, he transported himselfe thence to Venice,the receptacle of all foule sinne and abhomination, intending there toexercise his wonted bad behaviour, and live as wickedly as ever he haddone before. It came to passe, that some remorse of conscience tookehold of him, for the former passages of his dissolute life, and hepretended to be surprized with very great devotion, becomming muchmore Catholike then any other man, taking on him the profession of aFranciscane coldelier, and calling himselfe, Fryar Albert of Imola.

　　In this habite and outward appearance, hee seemed to leade anaustere and sanctimonious life, highly commending penance andabstinence, never eating flesh, or drinking wine, but when he wasprovided of both in a close corner. And before any person could takenotice thereof, hee became (of a theefe) Ruffian, forswearer, andmurtherer, as formerly he had-beene a great Preacher; yet notabandoning the forenamed vices, when secretly he could put any of themin execution. Moreover, being made Priest, when he was celebratingMasse at the Altar, if he saw himselfe to be observed by any; he wouldmost mournefully reade the passion of our Saviour, as one whose tearescost him little, whensoever hee pleased to use them; so that, in ashort while, by his preaching and teares, he fed the humours of theVenetians so pleasingly, that they made him executor (well-neere) ofall their Testaments, yea, many chose him as depositary or Guardion oftheir monies; because he was both Confessour and Councellor, almost toall the men and women.

　　By this well seeming out-side of sanctity, the Wolfe became aShepheard, and his renowne for holinesse was so famous in those parts,as Saint Frances himselfe had hardly any more. It fortuned, that ayoung Gentlewoman, being somewhat foolish, wanton and proud minded,named Madam Lisetta de Caquirino, wife to a wealthy Merchant, who wentwith certaine Gallies into Flanders, and there lay as Lieger longtime: in company of other Gentlewomen, went to be confessed by thisghostly Father; kneel. at his feete, although her heart was highenough, like a proud minded woman, (for Venetians are presumptuous,vaine-glorious, and witted much like to their skittish Gondoloes)she made a very short rehearsall of her sinnes. At length Fryar Albertdemanded of her, whether shee had any amorous friend or lover? Herpatience being exceedingly provoked, stearne anger appeared in herlookes, which caused her to returne him this answer. How now SirDomine? what? have you no eyes in your head? Can you not distinguishbetween mine, and these other common beauties? I could have Loversenow, if I were so pleased; but those perfections remaining in me, arenot to be affected by this man, or that. How many beauties have youbeheld, any way answerable to mine, and are more fit for Gods, thenmortals.

　　Many other idle speeches shee uttered, in proud opinion of herbeauty, whereby Friar Albert presently perceived, that thisGentlewoman had but a hollow braine, and was fit game for folly toflye at; which made him instantly enamoured of her, and that beyondall capacity of resisting, which yet he referred to a further, andmore commodious time. Neverthelesse, to shew himselfe an holy andreligious man now, he began to reprehend her, and told her plainely,that she was vain-glorious, and overcome with infinite follies.Heereupon, him call.ed him a logger headed beast, and he knew notthe difference betweene an ordinary complexion, and beauty of thehighest merit. In which respect, Friar Albert, being loth to offendher any further; after confession was fully ended, let her passeaway among the other Gentlewomen, she giving him divers disdainfulllookes.

　　Within some few dayes after, taking one of his trusty brethren inhis company, he went to the House of Madam Lisetta, where requiring tohave some conference alone with her selfe; shee tooke him into aprivate Parlor, and being there, not to be seene by any body, hefell on his knees before her, speaking in this manner. Madam, forcharities sake, and in regard of your owne most gracious nature, Ibeseech you to pardon those harsh speeches, which I used to you theother day, when you were with me at confession: because, the verynight ensuing thereon, I was chastised in such cruell manner, as I wasnever able to stirre forth of my bed, untill this very instantmorning; whereto the weake-witted Gentlewoman thus replyed. And whoI pray you (quoth she) did chastise you so severely? I will tell youMadam, said Friar Albert, but it is a matter of admirable secrecie.

　　Being alone by my selfe the same night in my Dorter, and in veryserious devotion, according to my usuall manner: suddenly I saw abright splendour about me, and I could no sooner arise to discernewhat it might be, and whence it came, but I espied a very goodly youngLad standing by me, holding a golden Bow in his hand, and a richQuiver of Arrowes hanging at his backe. Catching fast hold on my Hood,against the ground he threw me rudely, trampling on me with his feete,and beating me with so many cruell blowes, that I thought my body tobe broken in peeces. Then I desired to know, why he was so rigorous tome in his correction? Because (quoth he) thou didst so saucily presumethis day, to reprove the celestiall beauty of Madam Lisetta, who (nextto my Mother Venus) I love most dearely. Whereupon I perceived, he wasthe great commanding God Cupid, and therefore I craved most humblypardon of him. I will pardon thee (quoth he) but upon thiscondition, that thou goe to her so soone as conveniently thou canst,and (by lowly humility) prevaile to obtaine her free pardon: whichif she will not vouchsafe to grant thee, then shall I in stearne angerreturne againe, and lay so many torturing afflictions on thee, thatall thy whole life time shall be most hatefull to thee. And what thedispleased God saide else beside, I dare not disclose, except youplease first to pardon me.

　　Mistresse shallow-braine, being swolne big with this wind, like anempty bladder; conceived no small pride in hearing these words,constantly crediting them to be true, and therefore thus answered. DidI not tel you Father Albert, that my beauty was celestiall? But Isweare by my beauty, notwithstanding your idle passed arrogancy, Iam heartily sorry for your so severe correction; which that it mayno more be inflicted on you, I do freely pardon you; yet with thisproviso, that you tell me what the God else saide unto you; wheretoFryar Albert thus replyed. Madam, seeing you have so graciouslyvouchsafed to pardon me, I will thankfully tell you all: but youmust be very carefull and respective, that whatsoever I shallreveale unto you, must so closely be concealed, as no livingcreature in the World may know it; for you are the onely happy Ladynow living, and that happinesse relleth on your silence andsecrecie: with solemne vowes and protestations she sealed up hermany promises, and then the Fryar thus proceeded.

　　Madam, the further charge imposed on me by God Cupid, was to tellyou, that himselfe is so extremely enamored of your beauty, and youare become so gracious in his affection; as, many nights he hathcome to see you in your Chamber, sitting on your pillow, while youslept sweetly, and desiring very often to awake you, but onely fearingto affright you. Wherefore, now he sends you word by me, that onenight he intendeth to come visite you, and to spend some time inconversing with you. But in regard he is a God, and meerely a spiritin forme, whereby neither you or any else have capacity of beholdinghim, much lesse to touch or feele him: he saith that (for your sake)he will come in the shape of a man, giving me charge also to know ofyou, when you shall please to have him come, and in whose similitudeyou would have him to come, whereof he will not falle; in whichrespect, you may justly thinke your selfe to be the onely happywoman livng, and farre beyond all other in your good fortune.

　　Mistresse want-wit presently answered, shee was well contented, thatGod Cupid should love her, and she would returne the like loveagaine to him; protesting withill, that wheresoever shee should seehis majesticall picture, she would set a hallowed burning Taper beforeit. Moreover, at all times he should be most welcome to her,whensoever hee would vouchsafe to visite her; for, he should alwayesfinde her alone in her private Chamber: on this condition, that hisolde Love Psyches, and all other beauties else whatsoever, must be setaside, and none but her selfe onely to be his best Mistresse,referring his personall forme of appearance, to what shape himselfebest pleased to assume, so that it might not be frightfull, oroffensive to her.

　　Madam (quoth Friar Albert) most wisely have you answered, andleave the matter to me; for I will take order sufficiently, and toyour contentment. But you may do me a great grace, and without anyprejudice to your selfe, in granting me one poore request; namely,to vouchsafe the Gods appearance to you, in my bodily shape andperson, and in the perfect forme of a man as now you behold me: so mayyou safely give him entertainment, without any taxation of theworld, or ill apprehension of the most curious inquisition. Beside,a greater happinesse can never befall me: for, while he assumeth thesoule out of my body, and walketh on the earth in my humane figure:I shall be wandering in the joyes of Lovers Paradise, feeling thefruition of their felicities; which are such, as no mortality can becapeable of, no, not so much as in imagination.

　　The wise Gentlewoman replied, that she was well contented, inregard of the severe punishment inflicted on him by God Cupid, for thereproachfull speeches he had given her; to allow him so poore akinde of consolation, as he had requested her to grant him. WhereupponFriar Albert saide: Be ready then Madam to give him welcome tomorrow in the evening, at the entering into your house, for comming inan humane body, he cannot but enter at your doores: n e whereas, if(in powerfull manner) he made use of his wings, he then would Eye inat your window, and then you could not be able to see him.

　　Upon this conclusion, Albert departed, leaving Lisetta in nomeane pride of imagination, that God Cupid should be enamoured ofher beauty; and therefore she thought each houre a yeare, till shemight see him in the mortall shape of Friar Albert. And now was hisbraine wonderfully busied, to visite her in more then common or humanemanner; and therefore he made him a sute (close to his body) ofwhite Taffata, all poudred over with Starres, and spangles of Gold,a Bow and Quiver of Arrowes, with wings also fastened to his backebehinde him, and all cunningly covered with his Friars habit, whichmust be the sole meanes of his safe passage.

　　Having obtained licence of his Superiour, and being accompaniedwith an holy Brother of the Convent, yet ignorant of the businesseby him intended; he went to the house of a friend of his, which washis usuall receptacle, whensoever he went about such deeds of darknes.There did he put on his dissembled habit of God Cupid, with hiswinges, Bowe, and Quiver, in formall fashion; and then (clouded overwith his Monkes Cowle) leaves his companion to awaite his returningbacke, while he visited foolish Lisetta, according to her expectation,readily attending for the Gods arrivall.

　　Albert being come to the house, knocked at the doore, and the Maideadmitting him entrance, according as her Mistresse had appointed,she conducted him to her Mistresses Chamber, where laying aside hisFriars habite, and she seeing him shine with such glorioussplendour, adding action also to his assumed dissimulation, withmajesticke motion of his body, wings, and bow, as if he had bene GodCupid indeede, converted into a body much bigger of stature, thenPainters commonly do describe him, her wisedome was overcome withfeare and admiration, that she fell on her knees before him,expressing all humble reverence unto him. And he spreading his wingsover her, as with wiers and strings he had made them pliant; shewedhow graciously he accepted her humiliation; folding her in hisarmes, and sweetly kissing her many times together, with repetition ofhis entire love and affection towards her. So delicately was heperfumed with odorifferous savours, and so compleate of person inhis spangled garments, that she could do nothing else, but wonder athis rare behaviour, reputing her felicity beyond all Womens in theworld, and utterly impossible to be equalled, such was the pride ofher presuming. For he told her clivers tales and fables, of hisawefull power among the other Gods, and stolne pleasures of his uponthe earth; yet gracing her praises above all his other Loves, andvowes made now, to affect none but her onely, as his often visitationsshould more constantly assure her, that she verily credited all hisprotestations, and thought his kisses and embraces, farre to exceedany mortall comparison.

　　After they had spent so much time in amorous discoursing, as mightbest fit with this their first meeting, and stand cleare fromsuspition on either side: our Albert Cupid, or Cupid Albert, whichof them you best please to terme him, closing his spangled wingestogether againe behinde his backe, fastening also on his Bow andQuiver of Arrowes, overclouds all with his religious Monkes Cowle, andthen with a parting kisse or two, returned to the place where he hadleft his fellow and companion, perhaps imployed in as devout anexercise, as he had bin in his absence from him; whence both repayringhome to the Monastery, all this nightes wandering was allowed astollerable, by them who made no spare of doing the like.On the morrow following, Madam Lisetta immediately after dinner,being attended by her Chamber-maid, went to see Friar Albert,finding him in his wonted forme and fashion, and telling him whathad hapned betweene her and God Cupid, with all the other lies andtales which hee had told her. Truly Madam (answered Albert) whatyour successe with him hath beene, I am no way able to comprehend; butthis I can assure you, that so soone as I had acquainted him with youranswer, I felt a sodaine rapture made of my soule, and visibly (tomy apprehension) saw it carried by Elves and Fairies, into thefloury fields about Elisium, where Lovers departed out of this life,walke among the beds of Lillies and Roses, such as are not in thisworld to be seene, neither to be imagined by any humane capacity. Sosuper-abounding was the pleasure of this joy and solace, that, howlong I continued there, or by what meanes I was transported hitheragaine this morning, it is beyond all ability in mee to expresse, orhow I assumed my body againe after that great God had made use thereofto your service. Well Fryar Albert (quoth shee) you may see what anhappinesse hath befalne you, by so grosse an opinion of myperfections, and what a felicity you enjoy, and still are like todo, by my pardoning your error, and granting the God accesse to mein your shape: which as I envy not, so I wish you heereafter to bewiser, in taking upon you to judge of beauty. Much other idle follyproceeded from her, which still he soothed to her contentment, and (asoccasion served) many meetings they had in the former manner.

　　It fortuned within few dayes after that Madam Lisetta being incompany with one of her Gossips, and their conference (as commonlyit falleth out to be) concerning other women of the City; theirbeauty, behaviour, amorous suters and servants, and generall opinionconceived of their worth, and merit; wherein Lisetta was over-muchconceyted of her selfe, not admitting any other to be her equall.Among other speeches, savouring of an unseasoned braine: Gossip (quothshe) if you knew what account is made of my beauty, and who holdesit in no meane estimation, you would then freely confesse, that Ideserve to be preferred before any other. As women are ambitious intheir owne opinions, so commonly are they covetous of one anotherssecrets, especially in matter of emulation, whereupon the Gossipthus replyed. Beleeve me Madam, I make no doubt but your speechesmay be true, in regard of your admired beauty, and many otherperfections beside; yet let me tell you, priviledges, how great andsingular soever they be, without they are knowen to others, besidesuch as do particularly enjoy them; they carry no more account, thenthings of ordinary estimation. Whereas on the contrary, when anyLady or Gentlewoman hath some eminent and peculiar favour, which fewor none other can reach unto, and it is made famous by generallnotion; then do all women else admire and honor her, as the glory oftheir kinde, and a miracle of Nature.

　　I perceive Gossip said Lisetta, whereat you aime, and such is mylove to you, as you should not lose your longing in this case, wereI but constantly secured of your secrecy, which as hitherto I havebene no way able to taxe, so would I be loth now to be more suspitiousof then needs. But yet this matter is of such maine moment, that ifyou will protest as you are truly vertuous, never to reveale it to anyliving body, I will disclose to you almost a miracle. The vertuousoath being past, with many other solemne protestations beside, Lisettathen pro. ceeded in this maner.

　　I know Gossip, that it is a matter of common and ordinary custome,for Ladies and Gentlewomen to be graced with favourites, men of fraileand mortall conditions, whose natures are as subject to inconstancy,as their very best endevours dedicated to folly, as I could name nomean number of our Ladies heere in Venice. But when Soveraigne deitiesshall feele the impression of our humane desires, and beholdsubjects of such prevailing efficacy, as to subdue their greatestpower, yea, and make them enamored of mortall creatures: you maywell imagine Gossip, such a beauty is superiour to any other. And suchis the happy fortune of your friend Lisetta, of whose perfections,great Cupid the awefull commanding God of Love himselfe, conceivedsuch an extraordinary liking: as he hath abandoned his seate ofsupreme Majesty, and appeared to in the shape of a mortall man, withlively expression of his amourous passions, and what extremities ofanguish he hath endured, onely for my love. May this be possible?replied the Gossip. Can the Gods be toucht with the apprehension ofour fraile passions? True it is Gossip, answered and so certainlytrue, that his sacred kisses, sweete embraces, and most pleasingspeeches with proffer of his continuall devotion towards me, hathgiven me good cause to confirme what I say, and to thinke myfelicity farre beyond all other womens, being honoured with hisoften nightly visitations.

　　The Gossip inwardly smiling at her idle speeches, which(nevertheles) she avouched with very vehement asseverations: fellinstantly sicke of womens naturall disease, thinking every minute atedious month, till she were in company with some other Gossips, tobreake the obligation of her vertuous promise, and that others (aswell as her selfe) might laugh at the folly of this shallow-wittedwoman. The next day following, it was her hap to be at a wedding,among a great number of other women, whom quickly she acquaintedwith this so strange a wonder; as they did the like to their husbands:and passing so from hand to hand, in lesse space then two dayes, allVenice was fully possessed with it. Among the rest, the brethren tothis foolish woman, heard this admirable newes concerning theirSister; and they discreetly concealing it to themselves, closelyconcluded to watch the walks of this pretended God: and if he soarednot too lofty a flight, they would clip his wings, to come thebetter acquainted with him. It fortuned, that the Friar hearing hisCupidicall visitations over-publikely discovered, purposed to checkand reprove Lisetta for her indiscretion. And being habitedaccording to his former manner, his Friarly Cowle covering all hisformer bravery, he left his companion where he used to stay, andclosely walked along unto the house. No sooner was he entred, butthe Brethren being ambushed neere to the doore, went in after him, andascending the staires, by such time as he had uncased himselfe, andappeared like God Cupid, with his spangled wings displayed: theyrushed into the Chamber, and he having no other refuge, opened a largeCasement, standing directly over the great gulfe or River, andpresently leapt into the water; which being deepe, and he skilfullin swimming, he had no other harme by his fall, albeit the sodaineaffright did much perplex him.

　　Recovering the further side of the River, he espied a light, and thedoore of an house open, wherein dwelt a poore man, whom he earnestlyintreated, to save both his life and reputation, telling him many liesand tales by what meanes he was thus disguised, and throwne bynight-walking Villaines into the water. The poore man, being movedto compassionate his distressed estate, laid him in his owne bed,ministring such other comforts to him, as the time and his poverty didpermit; and day drawing on, he went about his businesse, advisinghim to take his rest, and it should not be long till he returned.So, locking the doore, and leaving the counterfet God in bed, awaygoes the poore man to his daily labor. The Brethren to Lisetta,perceiving God Cupid to be fied and gone, and she in melanchollysadnesse sitting by them: they tooke up the Reliques he had leftbehind him, I meane the Friars hood and Cowle, which shewing totheir sister, and sharpely reproving her unwomanly behaviour: theyleft her in no meane discomfort, returning home to their ownehouses, with their conquered spolle of the forlorne Friar.

　　During the times of these occurrences, broad day speeding on, andthe poore man returning homeward by the Rialto, to visit his guestso left in bed: he beheld divers crouds of people, and a generallrumor noysed among them, that God Cupid had bene that night with MadamLisetta, where being over-closely pursued by her Brethren, for feareof being surprized, he leapt out of her window into the gulfe, andno one could tell what was become of him. Heereupon, the poore manbegan to imagine, that the guest entertained by him in the night time,must needs be the same suppose God Cupid, as by his wings and otherembellishments appeared: wherefore being come home, and sittingdowne on the beds side by him, after some few speeches passingbetweene them, he knew him to be Friar Albert, who promised to givehim fifty ducates, if he would not betray him to Lisettaes Brethren.Upon the acceptation of this offer, the money being sent for, andpaied downe; there wanted nothing now, but some apt and convenientmeanes, whereby Albert might safely be conveyed into the Monastery,which being wholly referred to the poore mans care and trust, thushe spake. Sir, I see no likely-hood of your cleare escaping home,except in this manner as I advise you. We observe this day as amerry Festivall, and it is lawfull for any one, to disguise a man inthe skin of a Beare, or in the shape of a savage man, or any otherforme of better advice. Which being so done, he is brought upon S.Markes market place, where being hunted a while with dogs, upon thehuntings conclusion, the Feast is ended; and then each man leadeshis monster whether him pleaseth. If you can accept any of theseshapes, before you be seene heere in my poore abiding, then can Isafely (afterward) bring you where you would be. Otherwise, I see nopossible meanes, how you may escape hence unknown; for it is withoutall question to the contrary, that the Gentlewomans brethren,knowing your concealment in some one place or other, wil set suchspies and watches for you throughout the City, as you must needs betaken by them.

　　Now, although it seemed a most severe imposition, for Albert topasse in any of these disguises: yet his exceeding feare ofLisettaes brethren and friends, made him gladly yeelde, and to undergowhat shape the poore man pleased, which thus he ordered. Annointinghis naked body with Hony, he then covered it over with downy smallFeathers, and fastening a chaine about his necke, and a strange uglyvizard on his face, he gave him a great staffe in the one hand, andtwo huge Mastive dogs chained together in the other, which he hadborrowed in the Butchery. Afterward, he sent a man to the Rialto,who there proclaimed by the sound of Trumpet: That all such as desiredto see God Cupid, which the last nights had descended downe from theskies, and fell (by ill hap) into the Venetian gulfe, let them repaireto the publike Market place of S. Marke, and there he would appeare inhis owne likenesse.

　　This being done, soone after he left his house, and leading him thusdisguised along by the chaine, he was followed by great crowds ofpeople, every one questioning of whence, and what he was. In whichmanner, he brought him, to the Market place, where an infinitenumber of people were gathered together, as well of the followers,as of them that before heard the proclamation. There he made choice ofa pillar, which stood in a place somewhat highly exalted, wherto hechained his savage man, making shew, as if be meant to awaite there,till the hunting should begin: in which time, the Flies, Waspes, andHornets, did so terribly sting his naked body, being annointed withHony, that he endured therby unspeakable anguish. When the poore mansaw, that there needed no more concourse of people; pretending, asif he purposed to let loose his Salvage man; he tooke the maske orvizard from Alberts face, and then he spake aloud in this manner.Gentlemen and others, seeing the wilde Boare commeth not to ourhunting, because I imagine that he cannot easily be found: I meane (tothe end you may not lose your labour in comming hither) to shew youthe great God of Love called Cupid, who Poets feigned long since to bea little boy, but now growne to manly stature. You see in what manerhe hath left his high dwelling onely for the comfort of our Venetianbeauties: but belike, the night-fogs overflagging his wings, he fellinto our gulfe, and comes now to present his service to you. No soonerhad he taken off his vizard, but every one knew him to be FryarAlbert; and sodainely arose such shoutes outcries, with most bitterwords breathed forth against him, hurling also stones, durt andfilth in his face, that his best acquaintance then could take noknowledge of him, and not any one pittying his abusing. So longcontinued the offended people in their fury, that the newes therof wascarried to the Convent, and six of his Religious Brethren came, whocasting an habite about him, and releasing him from his chaine, theyled him to the Monastery, not without much mollestation and trouble ofthe people; where imprisoning him in their house, severity of someinflicted punishment, or rather conceite for his open shame,shortned his dayes, and so he dyed. Thus you see (fayre Ladies) whenlicentious life must be clouded with a cloake of sanctifie, andevill actions daylie committed, yet escaping uncredited: there willcome a time at length, for just discovering of all, that the goodmay shine in their true luster of glory, and the bad sinke in theirowne deserved shame.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　HEEREIN IS DECLARED, HOW DANGEROUS THE OCCASION IS, ENSUING BY

　　ANGER AND DESPIGHT, IN SUCH AS ENTIRELY LOVE, ESPECIALLY

　　BEING INJURIED AND OFFENDED BY THEM THAT THEY LOVE

　　Three yong Gentlemen affecting three Sisters, fledde with theminto Candie. The eldest of them (through jealousie) becommeth thedeath of her Lover; The second, by consenting to the Duke of Candiesrequest, is the meanes of saving her life. Afterward, her owneFriend killeth her, and thence flyeth away with the elder Sister.The third couple, are charged with her death, and being committedprisoners, they confesse the fact; and fearing death, by corruption ofmoney they prevaile with their Keepers, escaping from thence toRhodes, where they dyed in great poverty.

　　When the King perceyved that Madame Pampinea had ended herdiscourse, he sat sadly a pretty while, without uttering one word, butafterward spake thus. Little goodnesse appeared in the beginning ofthis Novell, because it ministred occasion of mirth; yet the endingproved better, and I could wish, that worse inflictions had falne onthe venerious Friar. Then turning towards Madam Lauretta, he said;Lady, do you tell us a better tale, if possible it may be. Shesmiling, thus answered the King: Sir, you are over-cruelly bentagainst poore Lovers, in desiring, that their amourous processionsshould have harsh and sinister concludings. Neverthelesse, inobedience to your severe command, among three persons amourouslyperplexed, I will relate an unhappy ending; whereas all may be saideto speede as unfortunately, being equally alike, in enjoying the issueof their desires, and thus I purpose to proceed.

　　Every Vice (choice Ladies) as very well you know, redoundeth tothe great disgrace and prejudice of him, or her, by whom it ispractised, and oftentimes to others. Now, among those commonhurtfull enemies, the sinne or vice which most carrieth us with fullcarrere, and draweth us into unadvoydable dangers (in mine opinion)seemeth to be that of choller or anger, which is a sodain andinconsiderate moving, provoked by some received injury, which havingexcluded all respect of reason, and dimnd (with darke vapors) thebright discerning sight of the understanding, enflameth the minde withmost violent fury. And albeit this inconvenience hapneth most tomen, and more to some few then others, yet notwithstanding, it hathbene noted, that women have felt the selfesame infirmity, and inmore extreme manner, because it much sooner is kindled in them, andburneth with the brighter flame, in regard they have the lesserconsideration, and therefore not to be wondred at. For if we wiladvisedly observe, we shall plainely perceive, that fire even of hisowne nature) taketh hold on such things as are light and tender,much sooner then it can on hard and weighty substances; and some of uswomen (let men take no offence at my words) are farre more soft anddelicate then they be, and therefore more fraile. In which regard,seeing wee are naturally enclined hereto, and considering also, howmuch our affability and gentlenesse do shew themselves pleasing andfull of content to those men with whom we are to live; and likewise,how anger and fury are compacted of extraordinary perils: I purpose(because we may be the more valiant in our courage, to outstand thefierce assaults of wrath and rage) to shew you by mine ensuing Novell,how the loves of three yong Gentlemen, and of as many Gentlewomen,came to fatall and fortunat successe by the tempestuous anger of oneamong them, as I have formerly related unto you.

　　Marseilles (as you are not now to learne) is in Provence; seatedon the Sea, and is also a very ancient and most Noble Citty, whichhath bene (heeretofore) inhabited with farre richer and more wealthyMerchants, then at this instant time it is. Among whom, there wasone named Narnaldo Civida, a man but of meane condition, yet cleare infaith and reputation, and in lands, goods, and ready monies,immeasurably rich. Many children he had by his Wife, among whom werethree Daughters, which exceeded his Sonnes in yeeres. Two of thembeing twinnes, and borne of one body, were counted to be fifteeneyeeres old; the third was foureteene, and nothing hindered marriage intheir Parents owne expectation but the returne home of Narnaldo, whowas then abroad in Spaine with his Merchandizes. The eldest of theseSisters was named Ninetta, the second Magdalena, and the thirdBertella. A Gentleman (albeit but poore in fortunes) and calledRestagnone, was so extraordinarily enamoured of Ninetta, as no manpossibly could be more, and she likewise as earnest in affectiontowards him; yet both carrying their loves proceeding with suchsecrecy, as long time they enjoyed their hearts sweet contentment, yetundiscovered.

　　It came to passe, that two other young Gallants, the one namedFolco, and the other Hugnetto, (who had attained to incredible wealth,by the decease of their Father) were also as far in love, the one withMagdalena, and the other with Bertella. When Restagnone hadintelligence thereof, by the meanes of his faire friend Ninetta, hepurposed to releeve his poverty, by friendly furthering both theirlove, and his owne: and growing into familiarity with them, onewhile he would walke abroad with Folco, and then againe with Hugnetto,but oftner with them both together, to visite their Mistresses, andcontinue worthy friendship. On a day, when hee saw the time suteableto his intent, and that hee had invited the two Gentlemen home untohis House, he fell into this like Conference with them.

　　Kinde Friends (quoth he) the honest familiarity which hath pastbetweene us, may render you some certaine assurance, of the constantlove I beare to you both, being as willing to worke any meanes thatmay tend to your good, as I desire to compasse And because the truthof mine affection cannot conceale it selfe to you, I meane to acquaintyou with an intention, wherewith my braine hath a long While travelledand now may soone be delivered of, if it may passe with your likingand approbation. Let me then tell you, that except your speechessavour of untruth, and your actions carry a double understaning, incommon behaviour both by night and day, you appeare to and consumeaway, in the cordiall love you beare to two of the Sisters, as Isuffer the same afflictions for the third, with reciprocall. requitallof their deerest affection to us. Now, to qualifie the heate of ourtormenting flames, if you will condescend to such a course as Ishall advise you, the remedy will yeild them equall ease to ours,and we may safely injoy the benefit of contentment. As wealthaboundeth with you both, so doth want most extremely tyrannize overme: but if one banke might be made of both your rich substances, Iembraced therein as a third partaker, and some quarter of the worlddissigned out by us, where to live at hearts ease upon yourpossessions, I durst engage my credit, that all the sisters (notmeanely stored with their Fathers treasure) shall beare us companyto what place soever we please. There each man freely enjoying hisowne deerest love, may live like three brethren, without anyhinderance to our mutuall content: it remaineth now in youGentlemen, to accept this comfortable offer, or to refuse it.

　　The two Brothers, whose pass exceeded their best means forsupport, perceiving some hope how to enjoy their loves; desired nolong time of deliberation, or greatly disputed with their thoughtswhat was best to be done: but readily replyed, that let happen anydanger whatsoever, they would joyne with him in this determination,and he should partake with them in their wealthiest fortunes. AfterRestagnone had heard their answer, within some few dayes following, hewent to confer with Ninetta, which was no easie matter for him tocompasse. Neverthelesse, opportunity proved so favourable to him, thatmeeting with her at a private place appointed, he discoursed at large,what had passed betweene him and the other two young Gentlemen,maintaining the same with many good reasons, to have her like andallow of the enterprize. Which although (for a while) he could veryhardly doe; yet, in regard shee had more desire then power, withoutsuspition to be daily in his company, she thus answered. My heartschosen friend, I cannot any way mislike your advice, and will takesuch order with my Sisters, that they shal agree to our resolution.Let it therefore be your charge, that you and the rest make everything ready, to depart from hence so soone, as with best convenientmeanes we may be enabled.

　　Restagnone being returned to Folco and Hugnetto, who thoughteverie houre a yeare, to heare what would succeede upon the promisepast between them; he told them in plain termes, that their Ladieswere as free in consent as they, and nothing wanted now, butfurnishment for their sodaine departing. Having concluded, that Candyeshould bee their harbour for entertainment, they made sale of some fewinheritances which lay the readiest for the purpose, as also the goodsin their Houses; and then, under colour of venting Merchandizesabroad, they bought a nimble Pinnace, fortified with good strength andpreparation, and wayted but for a convenient winde. On the other side,Ninetta who was sufficiently acquainted with the forwardnesse of herSisters desires, and her owne, had so substantially prevailed withthem, that a good Voyage now was the sole expectation. Whereupon,the same night when they should set away, they opened a stronkbarred Chest of their Fathers, whence they tooke great store of Goldand costly jewels, wherewith escaping secretly out of the house;they came to the place where their Lovers attended for them, and goingall aboord the Pinnace, the windes were so furtherous to them, thatwithout touching any where, the night following, they arrived atGeneway.There being out of perill or pursuit, they all knit the knot ofholy wedlocke, and then freely enjoyed their long wished desires, fromwhence setting saile againe, and being well furnished with allthings wanting passing on from Port to Port, at the end of eightdayes, they landed in Candie, not meeting with any impeachment onthe way. Determining there to spend their daies, first they providedthemselves of goodly land in the Countrey, and then of beautifulldwelling houses in the City, with al due furnishments belonging tothem, and Families well beseeming such worthy Gentlemen, and alldelights else for their dally recreations, inviting their. Neighbours,and they them againe in loving manner; so that no lovers could wish tolive in more ample contentment.

　　Passing on their time in this height of felicity, and not crossed byany sinister accidents, it came to passe (as often wee may obseryein the like occasions, that although delights doe most especiallyplease us, yet they breede surfet, when they swell too over-great inabundance) that Restagnone, who most deerely affected his faireNinetta, and had her now in his free possession, without any perill ofloosing her: grew now also to bee weary of her, and consequently, tofaile in those familiar performances, which formerly had passedbetweene them. For, being one day invited to a Banket, hee saw there abeautifull Gentlewoman of that Countrey, whose perfections pleasinghim beyond all comparison: he laboured (by painfull pursuite) to winhis purpose; and meeting with her in divers private places, grewprodigall in his expences upon her. This could not be so closelycarried, but being seene and observed by Ninetta, she became possessedwith such extreame jealousie, that hee could not doe any thingwhatsoever, but immediately she had knowledge of it: which fire,growing to a flame in her, her patience became extreamely provoked,urging rough and rude speeches from her to him, and daily tormentinghim beyond power of sufferance.

　　As the enjoying of any thing in too much plenty, makes it appeareirkesome and loathing to us, and the deniall of our desires, do moreand more whet on the appetite: even so did the angry spleen of Ninettaproceed on in violence, against this new commenced love of Restagnone.For, in succession of time, whether he enjoyed the embracements of hisnew Mistresse, or no: yet Ninetta (by sinister reports, but muchmore through her owne jealous imaginations) held it for infallible,and to bee most certaine. Heereupon, she fell into an extreamemelancholly, which melancholly begat implacable fury, and(consequently) such contemptible disdaine, as converted her formerlykindely love to Restagnone, into Most cruell and bloudie hatred;yea, and so strangely was reason or respect confounded in her, as norevenge else but speed death, might satisfie the wrongs sheeimagined to receive by Restagnone and his Minion.

　　Upon enquiry, by what meanes shee might best compasse her bloodyintention, she grew acquainted with a Grecian woman, and wonderfullyexpert in the compounding of poysons, whom shee so perswaded bygifts and bounteous promises, that at the length shee prevayled withher. A deadly water was distilled by her, which (without any othercounsell to the contrary) on a day when Restagnone had his bloodsomewhat over-heated, and little dreamed on any such Treason conspiredagainst him by his Wife, shee caused him to drinke a great draughtthereof, under pretence, that it was a most soveraigne and cordiallwater; but such was the powerfull operation thereof, that the verynext morning, Restagnone was found to bee dead in his bed. When hisdeath was understoode by Folco, Hugnetto, and their Wives, and notknowing how hee came to bee thus empoysoned (because their Sisterseemed to bemoane his sodaine death, with as apparant shewes ofmourning, as they could possibly expresse) they buried him veryhonourably, and so all suspition ceased.

　　But as Fortune is infinite in her fagaries, never acting disaster soclosely, but as cunningly discovereth it againe: so it came topasse, that within a few dayes following, the Grecian Woman that haddelivered the poyson to Ninetta, for such another deede ofdamnation, was apprehended even in the action. And being put upon hetortures, among many other horrid villanies her committed, sheconfessed the empoysoning of Restagnone, and every particle theretoappertaining. Whereupon, the Duke of Candie, without any noyse orpublication, setting a strong guard (in the night time) about thehouse of Folco, where Ninetta then was lodged; there sodainly theyseized on her, and upon examination, in maintenance of desperaterevenge, voluntarily confessed the fact, and what else concerned theoccasion of his death, by the wrongs which he had offered her.

　　Folco and Hugnetto understanding secretly, both from the Duke, andother intimate friends, what was the reason of Ninettaes apprehension,which was not a little displeasing to them, labored by all theirbest paines and endeavour, to worke such meanes with the Duke, thather life might not perish by fire, although she had most justlydeserved it; but all theyr attempts proved to no effect, because theDuke had concluded to execute justice.

　　Heere you are to observe, that Magdalena (beeing a very beautifullWoman, yong, and in the choisest flower of her time:) had often beforebene solicited by the Duke, to entertaine his love and kindnesse:whereto by no meanes she would listen or give consent. And being nowmost earnestly importuned by her for the safetie of her Sisterslife, hee tooke hold on this her dayly suite to him, and in privatetold her, that if she was so desirous of Ninettaes life: it lay in herpower to obtain it, by granting him the fruition of her love. Sheapparantly perceiving that Ninetta was not likely to live, but bythe prostitution of her chaste honour, which she preferred beforethe losse of her owne life, or her sisters, concluded to let her dye,rather then run into any such disgrace. But having an excellentingenious wit, quicke, and apprehensive in perillous occasions, sheintended now to make a triall of overreaching the lascivious Duke inhis wanton purpose, and yet to be assured of her sisters life, withoutany blemish to her reputation.

　　Soliciting him still as shee was wont to doe, this promise passedfrom her to him, that when Ninetta was delivered out of prison, and insafetie at home in her house: hee should resort thither in some queintdisguise, and enjoy his long expected desire; but untill then shewould not yeeld. So violent was the Duke in the prosecution of hispurpose, that under colour of altering the manner of Ninettaesdeath, not suffering her to bee consumed by fire, but to be drowned,according to a custome observed there long time, and at theimportunity of her Sister Magdalena, in the still silence of thenight, Ninetta was conveyed into a sacke, and sent in that manner tothe House of Folco, the Duke following soone after, to challenge herpromise.

　　Magdalena, having acquainted her Husband with her vertuousintention, for preserving her Sisters life, and disappointing the Dukein his wicked desire; was as contrary to her true meaning in thiscase, as Ninetta had formerly beene adverse to Restagnone, onely beingover-ruled likewise by jealousie, and perswaded in his rash opinion,that the Duke had already dishonoured Magdalena, otherwise, he wouldnot have delivered Ninetta out of prison. Mad fury gave further fireto this unmanly perswasion, and nothing will now quench this but thelife of poore Magdalena, suddenly sacrificed in the rescue of herSister, such a divell is anger, when the understandings bright eyeis thereby abused. No credit might bee given to her womanlyprotestations, or any thing seeme to alter his bloody purpose; but,having slaine Magdalena with his Poniard (notwithstanding her tearesand humble entreaties) he ranne in haste to Ninettaes Chamber, she notdreaming on any such desperate accident, and to her he used thesedissembling speeches.

　　Sister (quoth he) my wife hath advised, that I should speedilyconvey you hence, as fearing the renewing of the Dukes fury, andyour falling againe into the hands of justice: I have a Barkereadily prepared for you, and your life being secured, it is allthat she and I doe most desire. Ninetta being fearefull, and no waydistrusting what he had saide; in thankfull allowance of her Sisterscare, and curteous tender of his so ready service; departed thencepresently with him, not taking any farewell of her other Sister andher Husband. To the Seashore they came, very weakely provided ofmonies to defray their charges, and getting aboard the Barke, directedtheir course themselves knew not whether.

　　The amorous Duke in his disguise, having long daunced attendanceat Folcoes doore, and no admittance of his entrance; angerlyreturned backe to his Court, protesting severe revenge on Magdalena,if she gave him not the better satisfaction, to cleare her from thusbasely abusing him. On the morrow morning, when Magdalena was foundmurthered in her Chamber, and tidings thereof carried to the Duke;present search was made for the bloody offendor, but Folco beingfled and gone with Ninetta; some there were, who bearing deadly hatredto Hugnetto, incensed the Duke against him and his wife, assupposing them to be guilty of Magdalenaes death. He being theretovery easily perswaded, in regard of his immoderate love to theslaine Gentlewoman; went himselfe in person (attended on by his Guard)to Hugnettoes House, where both he and his wife were seized asprisoners.

　　These newes were very strange to them, and their imprisonment asunwelcome; and although they were truly inocent, either in knowledgeof the horrid fact, or the departure of Folco with Ninetta: yetbeing unable to endure the tortures extremity, they made themselvesculpable by confession, and that they had a hand with Folco in themurder of Magdalena. Upon this their forced confession, and sentenceof death pronounced on them by the Duke himselfe; before the dayappointed for their publike execution, by great summes of money, whichthey had closely hid in their House, to serve when any urgentextremitie should happen to them; they corrupted their keepers, andbefore any intelligence could be had of their flight, they escapedby Sea to Rhodes, where they lived afterward in great distresse andmisery. The just vengeance of Heaven followed after Folco and Ninetta,he for murthering his honest wife, and she for poysoning her offendingHusband: for being beaten a long while on the Seas, by tempestuousstormes and weather, and not admitted landing in any Port or creeke;they were driven backe on the Coast of Candie againe, where beingapprehended, and brought to the City before the Duke, they confessedtheir several notorious offences, and ended their loathed lives in onefire together.

　　Thus the idle and loose love of Restagnone, with the frantickerage and jealousie of Ninetta and Folco, overturned all their longcontinued happinesse, and threw a disastrous ending on them all.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　IN COMMENDATION OF JUSTICE BETWEENE PRINCES; AND DECLARING

　　WITHALL, THAT NEITHER FEARE, DANGERS, NOR DEATH IT SELFE,

　　CAN ANY WAY DAUNT A TRUE AND LOYALL LOVER

　　Gerbino, contrary to the former plighted faith of hisGrand-father, King Gulielmo, fought with a Ship at Sea, belonging tothe King of Thunis, to take away his Daughter, who was then in thesame Ship. Shee being slaine by them that had the possession of her,he likewise slew them; and afterward had his owne head smitten off.

　　Madam Lauretta having concluded her Novel, and the companycomplaining on Lovers misfortunes, some blaming the angry andjealous fury of Ninetta, and every one delivering their severallopinions; the King, as awaking out of a passionate perplexity, exaltedhis lookes, giving a signe to Madame Elisa, that shee should follownext in order, whereto she obeying, began in this manner. I have heard(Gracious Ladies, quoth she) of many people, who are verily perswaded,that loves arrowes, never wound any body, but onely by the eyes lookesand gazes, mocking and scorning such as maintaine that men may fall inlove by hearing onely. Wherein (beleeve me) they are greatly deceived,as will appeare by a Novell which I must now relate unto you, andwherein you shall plainely perceive, that not onely fame or reportis as prevailing as sight; but also hath conducted divers, to awretched and miserable ending of their lives.

　　Gulielmo the second, King of Sicilie, according as the SicilianChronicles record, had two children, the one a sonne, named DonRogero, and the other a daughter, called Madame Constance. The saideRogero died before his Father, leaving a sonne behind him, namedGerbino, who, with much care and cost, was brought up by hisGrand-father, proving to be a very goodly Prince, and wonderouslyesteemed for his great valour and humanity. His fame could notcontaine it selfe, within the bounds or limits of Sicilie onely, butbeing published very prodigally, in many parts of the world beside,flourished with no meane commendations throughout all Barbarie,which in those dayes was tributary to the King of Sicilie. Among otherpersons, deserving most to be respected, the renowned vertues, andaffability of this gallant Prince Gerbino, was understood by thebeautious Daughter to the King of Tunis, who by such as bad seene her,was reputed to be one of the rarest creatures, the best conditioned,and of the truest noble spirit, that ever Nature framed in her verychoicest pride of Art.

　　Of famous, vertuous, and worthy men, it was continually her cheefestdelight to heare, and the admired actions of valiant Gerbino, reportedto her by many singular discoursers: such as could best describehim, with language answerable to his due deservings, won suchhonourable entertainment in her understanding soule, that they weremost affectionately pleasing to her, and in recapitulating (over andover againe) his manifold and heroycall perfections; meere speech madeher extreamely amorous of him, nor willingly would she lend an eare toany other discourse, but that which tended to his honour andadvancement.

　　On the other side, the fame of her incomparable beauty, withaddition of her other infinite singularities beside; as the Worldhad given eare to innumberlesse places, so Sicilie came at lengthacquainted therewith, in such flowing manner, as was trulyanswerable to her merit. Nor seemed this as a bare babling rumour,in the Princely hearing of royall Gerbino; but was embraced withsuch a reall apprehension, and the entire probation of a trueunderstanding: that he was no lesse enflamed with noble affectiontowards her, then she expressed the like in vertuous opinion of him.Wherefore, awaiting such convenient opportunity, when he might entreatlicense of his Grand-father, for his owne going to Thunis, undercolour of some honourable occasion, for the earnest desire he had tosee her: he gave charge to some of his especiall friends (whoseaffaires required their presence in those parts) to let thePrincesse understand, in such secret manner as best they could devise,what noble affection he bare unto her, devoting himselfe onely toher service.

　　One of his chosen friends thus put in trust, being a jeweller, a manof singular discretion, and often resorting to Ladies for sight of hisjewels, winning like admittance to the Princesse: related at largeunto her, the honourable affection of Gerbino, with full tender of hisperson to her service, and that she onely was to dispose of him.Both the message and the messenger, were most graciously welcome toher, and flaming in the selfe-same affection towards him: as atestimony thereof, one of the very choisest Jewels which she bought ofhim, she sent by him to the Prince Gerbino, it being received by himwith such joy and contentment, as nothing in the world could be morepleasing to him. So that afterward, by the trusty carriage of thisJeweller, many Letters and Love-tokens passed betweene them, eachbeing as highly pleased with this poore, yet happy kind ofentercourse, as if they had seene and conversed with one another.

　　Matters proceeding on in this manner, and continuing longer thentheir love-sick passions easily could permit, yet neither being ableto finde out any other meanes of helpe; it fortuned that the King ofThunis promised his daughter in marriage to the King of Granada,whereat she grew exceedingly sorrowfull, perceiving, that not onelyshe should be sent further off, by a large distance of way from herfriend, but also be deprived utterly, of all hope ever to enjoy him.And if she could have devised any meanes, either by secret flight fromher Father, or any way else to further her intention, she would haveadventured it for the Princes sake. Gerbino in like maner bearing ofthis purposed marriage, lived in a hell of torments, consultingoftentimes with his soule, how he might be possessed of her bypower, when she should be sent by Sea to her husband, or privatestealing her away from her Fathers Court before: with these andinfinite other thoughts, was he incessantly afflicted, both day andnight.

　　By some unhappy accident or other, the King of Thunis heard ofthis their secret love, as also of Gerbinoes purposed policy tosurprize her, and how likely he was to effect it, in regard of hismanly valour, and store of stout friends to assist him. Hereupon, whenthe time was come, that he would convey his daughter thence to hermarriage, and fearing to be prevented by Gerbino: he sent to theKing of Sicilie, to let him understand his determination, craving safeconduct from him, without impeachment of Gerbino, or any one else,untill such time as his intent was accomplished. King Gulielmo beingaged, and never acquainted with the affectiotiate proceedings ofGerbino, nor any doubtfull reason to urge this security from him, in acase convenient to be granted: yeelded the sooner thereto rightwillingly, and as a signall of his honourable meaning, he sent him hisroyall Glove, with a full confirmation for his safe conduct.

　　No sooner were these Princely assurances received, but a goodly shipwas prepared in the Port of Carthagena, well furnished with allthinges thereto belonging, for the sending his daughter to the King ofGranada, waiting for nothing else but best favouring windes. The youngPrincesse, who understood and saw all this great preparation; secretlysent a servant of hers to Palermo, giving him especiall charge, on herbehalfe, to salute the Prince Gerbino, and to tell him that (withinfew dayes) she must be transported to Granada. And now opportunitygave faire and free meanes, to let the world know, whether he were aman of that magnanimous spirit, or no, as generall opinion hadformerly conceived of him, and whether he affected her so firmely,as by many close messages he had assured her. He who had the charge ofthis embassie, effectually performed it, and then returned backe toThunis.

　　The Prince Gerbino, having heard this message from his divineMistresse, and knowing also, that the Kin his Grandfather, had pasthis safe conduct to the King of Thunis, for peaceable passagethrough his Seas: was at his wits end, in this urgent necessity,what might best bee done. Notwithstanding, moved by the setledconstancy of his plighted Love, and the speeches delivered to him bythe messenger from the Princesse: to shew himselfe a man endued withcourage, he departed thence unto Messina, where he made ready twospeedy gallies, and fitting them with men of valiant disposition,set away to Sardignia, as making full account, that the Ship whichcarried the Princesse, must come along that Coast. Nor was hisexpectation therein deceived: for, within few dayes after, the Ship(not over-swiftly winded) come sailing neere to the place where theyattended for her arrivall; whereof Gerbino had no sooner gotten asight, but to animate the resolutes which were in his company, thus hespake.

　　Gentlemen, if you be those men of valour, as heretofore you havebene reputed, I am perswaded, that there are some among you, whoeither formerly have, or now instantly do feele, the all-commandingpower of Love, without which (as I thinke) there is not any mortallman, that can have any goodnesse- or vertue dwelling in him.Wherefore, if ever you have bene amorously affected, or presently haveany apprehension thereof, you shall the more easily Judge of what Inow aime at. True it is, that I do love, and love hath guided me to becomforted, and manfully assisted by you, because in yonder Ship, whichyou see commeth on so gently under saile (even as if she offered herselfe to be our prize) not onely is the Jewell which I most esteeme,but also mighty and unvalewable treasure, to be wonne without anydifficult labour, or hazard of a dangerous fight, you being men ofsuch undauntable courage. In the honour of which victory, I covetnot any part or parcell, but onely a Ladie, for whose sake I haveundertaken these Armes, and freely give you all the rest containedin the Ship. Let us set on them, Gentlemen, and my deerest friends;couragiously let us assaile the ship, you see how the wind favours us,and (questionlesse) in so good an action, Fortune will not faile us.

　　Gerbino needed not to have spoken so much, in perswading them toseize so rich a booty, because the men of Messina were naturallyaddicted to spoile and rapine: and before the Prince began hisOration, they had concluded to make the ship their purchase.Wherefore, giving a lowde shout, according to their Country manner,and commanding their Trumpets to sound chearfully, they rowed on amaine with their Oares, and (in meere despight) set upon the ship. Butbefore the Gallies could come neere her, they that had the chargeand managing of her, perceyving with what speede they made towardsthem, and no likely meanes of escaping from them, resolvedly theystood upon their best defence, for now it was no time to be slothfull.The Prince being come neere to the Ship, commanded that the Patronesshould come to him, except they would adventure the fight. When theSarazines were thereof advertised, and understood also what hedemanded, they returned answer: That their motion and proceeding inthis manner, was both against Law and plighted faith, which waspromised by the King of Sicilie, for their safe passage through theSea by no meanes to be mollested or assailed. In testimony whereof,they shewed his Glove, avouching moreover, that neither by force (orotherwise) they would yeelde, or deliver him any thing which theyhad aboorde their Ship.

　　Gerbino espying his gracious Mistresse on the Ships decke, and sheappearing to be farre more beautifull then Fame had made relation ofher: being much more enflamed now, then formerly he had bin, replyedthus when they shewed the Glove. We have (quoth he) no Faulcon herenow, to be humbled at the sight of your Glove: and therefore, if youwill not deliver the Lady, prepare your selves for fight, for wemust have her whether you will or no. Hereupon, they began to let flie(on both sides) their Darts and arrowes, with stones sent in violentsort from their slings, thus continuing the fight a long while, tovery great harme on either side. At the length, Gerbino perceiving,that small benefit would redound to him, if he did not undertakesome other kinde of course: he tooke a small Pinnace, whichpurposely he brought with him from Sardignia, and setting it on aflaming fire, conveyed it (by the Gallies help) close to the ship. TheSarazines much amazed thereat, and evidently perceiving, that eitherthey must yeeld or dye; brought their Kings daughter to the prow ofthe ship, most greevously weeping and wringing her hands. Then callingGerbino, to let him behold their resolution, there they slew hirbefore his face, and afterward, throwing her body into the Sea, saide:Take her, there we give her to thee, according to our bounden duty,and as thy perjury hath justly deserved.

　　This sight was not a little greevous to the Prince Gerbino, whomadded now with this their monstrous cruelty, and not caring whatbecame of his owne life, having lost her for whom he onely desiredto live: not dreading their Darts, Arrowes, slinged stones, or whatviolence els they could use against him; he leapt aboord their ship,in despight of all that durst resist him, behaving himselfe there likea hunger-starved Lyon, when he enters among a heard of beasts, tearingtheir carkasses in pieces both with his teeth and pawes. Such wasthe extreme fury of this poore Prince, not sparing the life of anyone, that durst appeare in his presence; so that what with thebloody slaughter, and violence of the fires encreasing in the Ship;the Mariners got such wealth as possibly they could save, andsuffering the Sea to swallow the rest, Gerbino returned unto hisGallies againe, nothing proud of this so ill-gotten victory.

　　Afterward, having recovered the Princesse dead body out of theSea, and enbalmed it with sighes and teares: he returned backe intoSicilie, where he caused it to be most honourably buried, in alittle Island, named Ustica, face to face confronting Trapanum. TheKing of Thunis hearing these disastrous Newes, sent his Ambassadors(habited in sad mourning) to the aged King of Sicilie, complainingof his faith broken with him, and how the accident had falne out.Age being sodainly incited to anger, and the King extreamly offendedat this injury, seeing no way whereby to deny him justice, it beingurged so instantly by the Ambassadors: caused Gerbino to beapprehended, and he himselfe (in regard that none of his Lords andBarons would therein assist him, but laboured to divert him by theirearnest importunity) pronounced the sentence of death on the Prince,and commanded to have him beheaded in his presence; affectingrather, to dye without an heire, then to be thought a King voyde ofjustice. So these two unfortunate Lovers, never enjoyed the very leastbenefite of their long wished desires: ended both their lives inviolent manner.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS PLAINLY PROVED, THAT LOVE CANNOT BE ROOTED UPPE,

　　BY ANY HUMANE POWER OR PROVIDENCE; ASPECIALLY IN SUCH

　　SOULE, WHERE IT HATH BENE REALLY APPREHENDED

　　The three Brethren to Isabella, slew a Gentleman that secretly lovedher. His ghost appeared to her in her sleepe, and shewed her in whatplace they had buried his body. She (in silent manner) brought awayhis head, aid putting it into a pot of earth, such as Flowers, Basile,or other sweete hearbes are usually set in; she watered it (a longwhile) with her teares. Wherefore her Brethren having intelligence;soone after she dyed, with meere conceite of sorrow.

　　The Novell of Madame Eliza being finished, and some-what commendedby the King, in regard of the Tragicall conclusion; Philomena wasenjoyned to proceede next with her discourse. She being overcomewith much compassion, for the hard Fortunes of Noble Gerbino, andhis beautifull Princesse, after an extreame and vehement sighe, thusshe spake. My Tale (worthy Ladies) extendeth not to persons of so highbirth or quality, as they were of whom Madame Eliza gave you relation:yet (peradventure) it may prove to be no lesse pittifull. And now Iremember my selfe, Messina so lately spoken of, is the place wherethis accident also happened.

　　In Messina there dwelt three young men, Brethren, and Merchants bytheir common profession, who becomming very rich by the death of theirFather, lived in very good fame and repute. Their Father was of SanGemignano, and they had a Sister named Isabella, young, beautifull,and well conditioned; who upon some occasion, as yet remainedunmarried. A proper youth, being a Gentleman borne in Pisa, andnamed Lorenzo, as a trusty factor or servant, had the managing ofthe brethrens businesse and affaires. This Lorenzo being of comelypersonage, affable, and excellent in his behaviour, grew so graciousin the eyes of Isabella, that she affoorded him many very respectivelookes, yea, kindnesses of no common quality. Which Lorenzo takingnotice of, and observing by degrees from time to time, gave over allother beauties in the City, which might allure any affection from him,and onely fixed his heart on her, so that their love grew to a mutuallembracing, both equally respecting one another, and entertainingkindnesses, as occasion gave leave.

　　Long time continued this amorous league: of love, yet not socunningly concealed, but at the length, the secret meeting of Lorenzo,and Isabella, to ease their poore soul of Loves oppressions, wasdiscovered by the eldest of the Brethren, unknowne to them who werethus betrayed. He being a man of great discretion, although this sightwas highly displeasing to him: yet notwithstanding, he kept it tohimselfe till the next morning, labouring his braine what might bestbe done in so urgent a case. When day was come, he resorted to hisother Brethren, and told them what he had seene in the time past,betweene their sister and Lorenzo.

　　Many deliberations passed on in this case; but after all, thusthey concluded together, to let it proceede on with patient that noscandall might ensue to them, or their Sister, no evill acte being (asyet) committed. And seeming, as if they knew not of their love, hada wary eye still upon her secret walkes, awaiting for someconvenient time, when without their owne prejudice, or Isabellaesknowledge, they might safely breake off this their stolne love,which was altogether against their liking. So, shewing no worsecountenance to Lorenzo, then formerly they had done, but imploying andconversing with him in kinde manner; it fortuned, that riding (allthree) to recreate themselves out of the City, they tooke Lorenzo intheir company, and when they were come to a solitarie place, such asbest suited with their vile purpose: they ran sodainly upon Lorenzo,slew him, and afterward enterred his body, where hardly it could bediscovered by any one. Then they returned backe to Messina, and gaveit forth (as a credible report) that they had sent him abroad abouttheir affaires, as formerly they were wont to do: which every oneverily beleeved, because they knew no reason why they shouldconceite any otherwise.

　　Isabella, living in expectation of his returne, and perceiving hisstay to her was so offensive long: made many demands to herBrethren, into what parts they had sent him, that his tarrying wasso quite from all wonted course. Such was her importunate speechesto them, that they taking it very discontentedly, one of them returnedher this frowning answer. What is your meaning Sister, by so manyquestionings after Lorenzo? What urgent affaires have you with him,that makes you so impatient upon his absence? If hereafter you makeany more demands for him, we shall shape you such a reply, as willbe but little to your liking. At these harsh words, Isabella fell intoabundance of teares, where-among she mingled many sighes andgroanes, such as were able to overthrow a farre stronger constitution:so that, being full of feare and dismay, yet no way distrusting herbrethrens cruell deede; she durst not question any more after him.

　　In the silence of darke night, as she lay afflicted in her bed,oftentimes would she call for Lorenzo, entreating his speedy returningto her: And then againe, as if he had bene present with her, shecheckt and reproved him for his so long absence. One night amongst therest, she being growen almost hopelesse, of ever seeing him againe,having a long while wept and greevously lamented; her senses andfaculties utterly spent and tired, that she could not utter any morecomplaints, she fell into a trance or sleepe; and dreamed, that theghost of Lorenzo appeared unto her, in torne and unbefitting garments,his lookes pale, meager, and staring: and (as she thought) thusspake to her. My deere love Isabella, thou dost nothing but tormentthy selfe, with calling on me, accusing me for overlong tarryingfrom thee: I am come therefore to let thee know, that thou canst notenjoy my company any more, because the very same day when last thousawest me, thy brethren most bloodily murthered me. And acquaintingher with the place where they had buried his mangled body: heestrictly charged her, not to call him at any time afterward, and sovanished away.

　　The young Damosell awaking, and giving some credite to her Vision,sighed and wept exceedingly; and after she was risen in the morning,not daring to say any thing to her brethren, she resolutelydetermined, to go see the place formerly appointed her, onely tomake triall, if that which she seemed to see in her sleepe, shouldcarry any likelyhood of truth. Having obtained favour of her brethren,to ride a dayes journey ney the City, in company of her trustyNurse, who long time had attended on her in the house, and knew thesecret passages of her love: they rode directly to the designed place,which being covered with some store of dried leaves, and more deeplysunke then any other part of the ground therabout, they digged notfarre, but they found the body of murthered Lorenzo, as yet verylittle corrupted or impaired, and then perceived the truth of hervision.

　　Wisedome and government so much prevailed with her, as to instructher soule, that her teares spent there, were meerley fruitelesse andin vaine, neither did the time require any long tarrying there. Gladlywould she have carried the whole body with her, secretly to bestowhonourable enterment on it, but it exceeded the compasse of herability. Wherefore, in regard she could not have all, yet she wouldbe. possessed of a part, and having brought a keene razor with her, byhelpe of the Nurse, she divided the head from the body, and wrapped itup in a Napkin, which the Nurse conveyed into her lap, and thenlaide the body in the ground againe. Thus being undiscovered by any,they departed thence, and arrived at home in convenient time, wherebeing alone by themselves in the Chamber: she washed the head over andover with her teares, and bestowed infinite kisses thereon.

　　Not long after, the Nurse having brought her a large earthen pot,such as we use to set Basile, Marjerom, Flowers, or other sweethearbes in, and shrouding the head in a silken Scarfe, put it into thepot, covering it with earth, and planting divers rootes of excellentBasile therein, which she never watered, but either with her teares,Rose water, or water distilled from the Flowers of Oranges. This potshe used continually to sitte by, either in her chamber, or anywhere else: for she carried it alwaies with her, sighing and breathingfoorth sad complaints thereto, even as if they had beene uttered toher Lorenzo, and day by day this was her continuall exercise, to theno meane admiration of her bretheren, and many other friends thatbeheld her.

　　So long she held on in this mourning manner, that, what by thecontinuall watering of the Basile, and putrifaction of the head, soburied in the pot of earth; it grew very flourishing, and mostodorifferous to such as scented it, that as no other Basile couldpossibly yeeld so sweete a savour. The neighbours noting thisbehaviour in her, observing the long continuance thereof, how much herbright beauty was defaced, and the eyes sunke into her head byincessant weeping, made many kinde and friendly motions, to understandthe reason of her so violent oppressions; but could not by anymeanes prevaile with her, or win any discovery by her Nurse, sofaithfull was she in secrecie to her. Her brethren also waxed wearieof this carriage in her; and having very often reproved her for it,without any other alteration in her: at length, they closely stoleaway the potte of Basile from her, for which she made infinitewofull lamentations, earnestly entreating to have it restoredagaine, avouching that she could not live without it.

　　Perceiving that she could not have the pot againe, she fell intoan extreame sicknesse, occasioned onely by her ceaselesse weeping: andnever urged she to have any thing, but the restoring of her Basilepot. Her brethren grew greatly amazed thereat, because she nevercalledfor ought else beside; and thereupon were very desirous to ransackethe pot to the very bottome. Having emptied out all the earth, theyfound the Scarfe of silke, wherein the head of Lorenzo was wrapped;which was (as yet) not so much consumed, but by the lockes of haire,they knew it to be Lorenzoes head, whereat they became confounded withamazement.

　　Fearing least their offence might come to open publication, theyburied it very secretly; and, before any could take notice thereof,they departed from Messina, and went to dwell in Naples, Isabellacrying and calling still for her pot of Basile, being unable to giveover mourning, dyed within a few dayes after. Thus have you heardthe hard fate of poore Lorenzo and his Isabella. Within no longwhile after, when this accident came to be publikely knowne, anexcellent ditty was composed thereof beginning thus.

　　Cruell and unkinde was the Christian,

　　That robd me of my Basiles blisse, etc.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE SIXTH NOVELL

　　DESCRIBING THE ADMIRABLE ACCIDENTS OF FORTUNE; AND THE

　　MIGHTY PREVAILING, POWER OF LOVE POWER OF LOVE

　　A beautifull young Virgine, named Andreana, became enamoured of ayoung Gentleman called Gabriello. In conference together, she declareda dreame of hers to him, and he another of his to her; whereuponGabriello fell downe sodainly dead in her armes. She, and herChamber-maide were apprehended, by the Officers belonging to theSeigneury, as they were carrying Gabriello, to lay him before his ownedoore. The Potestate offering violence to the Virgin, and sheresisting him vertuously: it came to the understanding of herFather, who approved the innocence of his daughter, and compassedher deliverance. But she afterward, being weary of all worldlyfelicities, entred into Religion, and became a Nun.

　　The Novell which Madam Philomena had so graciously related, washighly pleasing unto the other Ladies; because they had oftentimesheard the Song, without knowing who made it or upon what occasion itwas composed. But when the King saw that the Tale was ended: hecommanded Pamphilus, that he should follow in his due course:whereupon he spake thus.

　　The dreame already recounted in the last Novell, doth ministermatter to me, to make report of another Tale, wherein mention ismade of two severall dreames; which divined as well what was to ensue,as the other did what had hapned before. And no sooner were theyfinished in the relation, by both the parties which had formerlydreampt them, but the effects of both as soddainly followed.

　　Worthy Ladies, I am sure it is not unknowne to you, that it is,and hath bene a generall passion, to all men and women living, tosee divers and sundry things while they are sleeping. And although (tothe sleeper) they seeme most certaine, so that when he awaketh, hejudgeth the trueth of some, the likelyhood of others, and somebeyond all possibility of truth: yet notwithstanding, many dreameshave bene observed to happen; and very strangely have come to passe.And this hath bene a grounded reason for some men, to give as greatcredit to such things as they see sleeping, as they do to othersusually waking. So that, according unto their dreames, and as theymake construction of them, that are sadly distasted, or merrilypleased, even as (by them) they either feare or hope. On the contrary,there are some, who will not credit any dreame whatsoever, untill theybe falne into the very same danger which formerly they saw, and mostevidently in their sleepe.

　　I meane not to commend either the one or other, because they donot alwayes fall out to be true; neither are they at all timeslyars. Now, that they prove not all to be true, we can best testifieto our selves. And that they are not alwayes lyars, hath alreadysufficiently bene manifested, by the Discourse of Madame Philomena,and as you shall perceive by mine owne, which next commeth in order tosalute you. Wherefore, I am of this opinion, that in matters of goodlife, and performing honest actions; no dreame is to be fearedpresaging the contrary, neither are good works any way to be hindredby them. Likewise, in matters of bad and wicked quality, althoughour dreames may appeare favourable to us, and our visions flatter uswith prosperous successe: yet let us give no credence unto the best,nor addict our minds to them of contrary Nature. And now we wil.proceed to our Novell.

　　In the Citie of Brescia, there lived somtime a Gentleman, namedMesser Negro da Ponte Cararo, who (among many other children) had adaughter called Andreana, yong, and beautifull, but as yetunmarried. It fortuned, that shee fell in love with a Neighbour, namedGabriello; a comely young Gentleman, of affable complexion, andgraciously conditioned. Which love was (with like kindenesse)welcommed and entertained by him; and by the furtherance of herChamber-maide, it was so cunningly carried, that in the Gardenbelonging to Andreanaes Father, she had many meetings with herGabriello. And solemne vowes being mutually passed betweene them, thatnothing but death could alter their affection: by such ceremoniouswords as are used in marriage, they maried themselves secretlytogether, and continued their stolne chaste pleasures with equallcontentment to them both.

　　It came to passe, that Andreana sleeping in her bed, dreamed, thatshee met with Gabriello in the Garden, where they both embracinglovingly together, she seemed to see a thing blacke and terrible,which sodainely issued forth of his body, but the shape therof shecould not comprehend. It rudely seized upon Gabriello, and in despightof her utmost strength, with incredible force snatched him out ofher armes, and sinking with him into the earth, they never after didsee one another. Whereupon, overcome with extremity of greefe andsorrow, presently she awaked, being then not a little joyfull, thatshe found no such matter as she feared, yet continued very doubtfullof her dreame. In regard whereof, Gabriello being desirous to visiteher the night following: she laboured very diligently to hinder hiscomming to her; yet knowing his loyall affection toward her, andfearing least he should grow suspitious of some other matter, shewelcommed him into the Garden, where gathering both white andDamaske Roses (according to the nature of the season) at length,they sate downe by a very goodly Fountaine, which stoode in themiddest of the Garden.

　　After some small familiar Discourse passing betweene them, Gabriellodemanded of her, upon what occasion shee denyed his comming thitherthe night before, and by such a sodaine unexpected admonition?Andreana told him, that it was in regard of a horrid Dreame, wherewithher soule was perplexed the precedent night, and doubt what mightensue thereon. Gabriello hearing this, began to smile, affirming toher, that it was an especial note of folly, to give any credit to idledreames: because (oftentimes) they are caused by excesse of feeding,and continually are observed to be meere lyes. For (quoth he) if I hadany superstitious beleefe of Dreames, I should not then have comehither now: yet not so much as being dismayed by your dreame, butfor another of mine owne, which I am the more willing to acquaintyou withall.

　　Me thought, I was in a goodly delightfull Forrest, in the Nobleexercise of sportfull hunting, and became there possessed of a youngHinde, the verie loveliest and most pleasing beast that was everseene. It seemed to be as white as snow, and grew (in a short while)so familiar with me, that by no meanes it would forsake mee. I couldnot but accept this rare kindnes in the beast, and fearing least Ishould loose it, I put a collar of Gold about the necke thereof, andfastned it into a chaine of Gold also, which then I held strongly inmy hand. The blind afterward couched downe by me, laying his headmildely in my lap; and on the sodaine, a black Grey-hound bitch camerushing; on us (but whence, or how, I could not imagine) seeming halfehunger-starved, and very ugly to looke upon. At me she made her fullcarreere, without any power in me of resistance, and putting her mouthinto the left side of my bosom, griped it so mainly with her teeth,that (me thought) I felt my heart quite bitten through, and she tuggedon still, to take it wholly away from me; by which imagined paineand anguish I felt, instantly I awaked. Laying then my hand upon myside, to know whether any such harme had befalne me, or no, andfinding none, I smiled at mine owne folly, in making such afrivolous and idle search. What can be said then in these or thelike cases?

　　Divers times I have had as ill seeming dreames, yea, and much moreto be feared, yet never any thing hurtfull to me, followed thereon;and therefore I have alwayes made the lesse account of them.

　　The young Maiden, who was still dismayed by her owne Dreame,became much more afflicted in her minde, when shee had heard thisother reported by Gabriello: but yet to give him no occasion ofdistast, she bare it out in the best manner she could devise to doe.And albeit they spent the time in much pleasing discourse,maintained with infinite sweete kisses on either side: yet was shestill suspitious, but knew not whereof; fixing her eyes oftentimesupon his face, and throwing strange lookes to all parts of the Garden,to catch hold on any such blacke ugly sight, whereof he had formerlymade description to her. As thus she continued in these afflictingfeares, it fortuned, that Gabriello sodainly breathing forth a veryvehement sighe, and throwing his armes fast about her, said: O helpeme dear Love, or else I dye; and, in speaking the words, fell downeupon the ground. Which the yong Damosel perceiving, and drawing himinto her lappe, weeping saide: Alas sweete Friend, What paine doestthou feele?

　　Gabriello answered not one word, but being in an exceeding sweate,without any ability of drawing breath, very soon after gave up theghost. How greevous this strange accident was to poore Andreana, wholoved him as deerely as her owne life: you that have felt lovestormenting afflictions, can more easily conceive, then I relate.Wringing her hands, and weeping incessantly, calling him, rubbinghis temples, and using all likely meanes to reduce life: she found allher labour to be spent in vaine, because he was starke dead indeed,and every part of his body as cold as ice: whereupon, she was insuch wofull extremity, that she knew not what to do, or say. All aboutthe Garden she went weeping, in infinite feares and distraction insoule, calling for her Chamber maid, the only secret friend to theirstolne meetings, and told her the occasion of this sodaine sorrow.After they had sighed and mourned awhile, over the dead body ofGabriello, Andreana in this manner spake to her maide.

　　Seeing Fortune hath thus bereft me of my Love, mine owne life mustneeds be hatefull to me: but before I offer any violence to myselfe, let us devise some convenient meanes, as may both preserve minehonour from any touch or scandall, and conceale the secret lovepassing betweene us: but yet in such honest sort, that this body(whose blessed soule hath too soone forsaken it) may be honourablyenterred. Whereto her Mayde thus answered: Mistresse, never talke ofdoing any violence to your selfe, because by such a blacke and dismalldeed, as you have lost his kind company here in this life, so shallyou never more see him in the other world: for immediately you sinkedowne to hell, which foule place cannot be a receptacle for hisfaire soule, that was endued with so many singular vertues. Wherefore,I hold it farre better for you, to comfort your selfe by all goodmeanes, and with the power of fervent praier, to fight against alldesperate intruding passions, as a truly vertuous minde ought todoe. Now, as concerning his enterrement, the meanes is readilyprepared for you here in this Garden, where never he hath bene seeneby any, or his resorting hither knowne, but onely to our selves. Ifyou will not consent to have it so, let you and I convey his bodyhence, and leave it in such an apt place, where it may be found tomorrow morning: and being then carried to his owne house, hisfriends and kindred will give it honest buriall.

　　Andreana, although her soule was extraordinarily sorrowfull, andteares flowed abundantly from her eyes; yet she listned attentively tohir maids counsell; allowing her first advice against desperation,to be truly good; but to the rest thus she replyed. God forbid(quoth she) that I should suffer so deere a loving friend, as hehath alwayes shewed himselfe to me; nay, which is much more, myhusband; by sacred and solemne vowes passed betweene us, to be putinto the ground basely, and like a dog, or else to be left in the openstreet. He hath had the sacrifice of my virgin teares, and if I canprevaile, he shall have some of his kindreds, as I have instantlydevised, what (in this hard case) is best to be done. Forthwith shesent the maid to her Chamber, for divers elles of white Damaskelying in her Chest, which when she had brought, they spread itabroad on the grasse, even in the manner of a winding sheete, andtherein wrapped the body of Gabriello, with a faire wrought pillowunder his head, having first (with their teares) closed his mouthand eyes, and placed a Chaplet of Flowers on his head, covering thewhole shrowd over in the same manner; which being done, thus she spaketo her Maid.

　　The doore of his owne house is not farre hence, and thither(betweene us two) he may be easily caried, even in this maner as wehave adorned him; where leaving him in his owne Porch, we mayreturne back before it be day: and although it will be a sad sightto his friends, yet because he dyed in mine armes, and we being sowell discharged of the body, it will be a little comfort to me. Whenshe had ended these words, which were not uttered without infiniteteares, the maid entreated her to make hast, because the night swiftlypassed on. At last, she remembred the Ring on her finger, wherewithGabriello had solemnly espoused her, and opening the shroud againe,she put it on his finger, saying; My deere and loving husband, ifthy soule can see my teares, or any understanding do remaine in thybody, being thus untimely taken from me: receive the latest guift thougavest me, as a pledge of our solemne and spotlesse marriage. So,making up the shroud againe as it should be, and conveighing itclosely out of the Garden, they went on along with it, towardes hisdwelling house.

　　As thus they passed along, it fortuned, that they were met and takenby the Guard or Watch belonging to the Potestate, who had bin solate abroad, about very earnest and important businesse. Andreana,desiring more the dead mans company, then theirs whom she had thus metwithall, boldly spake thus to them. I know who and what you are, andcan tell my selfe, that to offer flight will nothing availe me:wherfore, I am ready to go along with you before the Seigneury, andthere will tell the truth concerning this accident. But let not anyman among you, be so bold as to lay hand on me, or to touch me,because I yeeld so obediently to you; neyther to take any thing fromthis body, except hee intend that I shall accuse him. In whichrespect, not any one daring to displease her, shee went with thedead bodle to the Seigneurie, there to answere all Objections.

　　When notice heereof was given to the Potestate, he arose; and sheebeing brought foorth into the Hall before him, he questioned with her,how and by what meanes this accident happened. Beside, he sent fordivers Physitians, to be informed by them, whether the Gentlemanwere poysoned, or otherwise murthered? All of them affirmed thecontrarie, avouching rather, that some Impostumation had engenderedneere his heart, which sodainly breaking, occasioned his as sodainedeath. The Potestate hearing this, and perceiving that Andreana waslittle or nothing at all faulty in the matter, her beauty and goodcarriage, kindled a vitlanous and lustful desire in him towards her,provoking him to the immodest motion, that upon granting hisrequest, he would release her. But when he saw, that all hisperswasions were to no purpose, hee sought to compasse his will byviolence; which like a vertuous and valiant Virago, shee worthilywithstood, defending her honour Nobly, and reprooving him with manyinjurious speeches, such as a lustfull Letcher Justlie deserved.

　　On the morrow morning, these newes being brought to her Father,Messer Negro da Ponte Cararo, greeving thereat exceedingly, andaccompanied with many of his friends, he went to the Pallace. Beingthere arrived, and informed of the matter by the Potestate: hedemaunded (in teares) of his daughter, how, and by what meanes sheewas brought thither? The Potestate would needs accuse her first, ofoutrage and wrong offered to him by her, rather then to tarry heraccusing of him; yet, commending the yong Mayden, and herconstancie, proceeded to say, that onely to prove her, he had madesuch a motion to her; but finding her so firme, his liking was nowso addicted to her, that- if her Father were so pleased to forgetthe remembrance of her former secret husband, he willingly wouldaccept her in marriage.

　　While thus they continued talking, Andreana comming before herFather, the teares trickling mainly downe her cheekes, and fallingat his feete, she began in this manner. Deare Father, I shall notneede to make an Historicall relation, either of my youthfullboldnesse or misfortunes, because you have both seene and knowne them:rather most humbly, I crave your pardon, for another errour by meecommitted, in that, both without your leave and liking, I accepted theman as my troth-plighted husband, whom (above all other in the world Imost intirely affected. If my offence heerein doe challenge theforfeite of my life, then (good Father) I free you from any suchpardon; because my onely desire is to dye your daughter, and in yourgracious favour: with which words, in signe of her humility, shekissed his feete. Messer Negro da Ponte, being a man well in yeeres,and of a gentle nature, observing what his daughter saide, could notrefraine from teares, and in his weeping, lovingly tooke her fromthe ground, speaking thus to her.

　　Daughter, I could have wisht, that thou hadst taken such an Husband,as (in my judgement) had bene best fitting for thee: yet if thoumadest election of one answerable to thine owne good liking, I have nojust reason to be offended therewith. My greatest cause of complaintis, thy too severe concealing it from me, and the small trust thoudidst repose in me, because thou hast lost him before I knew him.Neverthelesse, seeing these occasions are thus come to passe, andaccidents already ended, cannot possibly be re-called, it is mywill, that as I would gladly have contented thee, by making him my Sonin Law if he had lived, so I wil expresse the like love to him nowhe is dead. And so turning himselfe to his kindred and friends,lovingly requested of them, that they would grace Gabriello withmost honourable obsequies.

　　By this time, the kindred and friends to the dead man (uppon noiseof his death bruited abroad) were likewise come to the Pallace, yea,most of the men and women dwelling in the Cittie, the bodie ofGabriello being laide in the midst of the Court, upon the whiteDamaske shrowd given by Andreana, with infinite Roses and othersweet Flowers lying theron: and such was the peoples love to him, thatnever was any mans death, more to be bemoaned and lamented. Beingdelivered out of the Court, it was carried to buriall, not like aBurgesse or ordinary Citizen, but with such pompe as beseemed a LordBaron, and on the shoulders of very noble Gentlemen, with greathonor and reverence.

　　Within some few dayes after, the Potestate pursuing his formermotion of mariage, and the father mooving it to his daughter, shewould not by any meanes listen thereto. And he being desirous togive her contentment, delivered her and her Chamber-maid into aReligious Abbey, very famous for devotion and sanctity, whereafterwards they ended their lives.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREBY IS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND, THAT LOVE AND DEATH DO USE

　　THEIR POWER EQUALLY ALIKE, AS WELL UPON POORE AND MEANE

　　PERSONS, AS ON THEM THAT ARE RICH AND NOBLE

　　Faire Simonida affecting Pasquino, and walking with him in apleasant garden, it fortuned, that Pasquino rubbed his teeth with aleafe of Sage, and immediately fell downe dead. Simonida being broughtbefore the bench of Justice, and charged with the death of Pasquino,she rubbed her teeth likewise with one of the leaves of the same Sage,as declaring what shee saw him do, and thereon she dyed also in thesame manner.

　　Pamphilus having ended his Tale, the King declaring an outwardshew of compassion, in regard of Andreanaes disastrous Fortune;fixed his eye on Madam Aemilia, and gave her such an apparant signe,as expressed his pleasure, for her next succeeding in discourse; whichbeing sufficient for her understanding, thus she began. Faireassembly, the Novell so lately delivered by Pamphilus, maketh mewilling to report another to you, varying from it, in any kinde ofresemblance; onely this excepted: that as Andreana lost her lover in aGarden, even so did she of whom I am now to speake. And beingbrought before the seate of Justice, according as Andreana was,freed her selfe from the power of the Law; yet neither by force, orher owne vertue, but by her sodaine and inopinate death. Andalthough the nature of Love is such (according as we have oftentimesheeretofore maintained) to make his abiding in the houses of theNoblest persons; yet men and women of poore and farre inferiourquality, do not alwayes sit out of his reach, though enclosed in theirmeanest Cottages; declaring himselfe sometime as a powerfullcommaunder in those humble places, as he doth in the richest andmost imperious Palaces. As will plainly appeare unto you, either inall, or a great part of my Novell, whereto our Citie pleadeth sometitle; though, by the diversity of our discourses, talking of somany severall accidents; we have wandred into many other parts ofthe world, to make all answerable to our owne liking.

　　It is not any long time since, when there lived in our City ofFlorence, a young and beautifull Damosell, yet according to the natureof her condition; because she was the Daughter of a poore Father,and called by the name of Simonida. Now, albeit she was not suppliedby any better means, then to maintaine her selfe by her ownepainfull travell, and earne her bread before she could eate it, bycarding and spinning to such as employed her; yet was she not sobase or dejected a spirit, but had both courage and sufficient vertue,to understand the secret soliciting of love, and to distinguish theparts of well deserving both by private behaviour and outwardceremony. As naturall instinct was her first tutor thereto, sowanted she not a second maine and urging motion, a chip hewed out ofthe like Timber, one no better in birth then her selfe, a proper youngspringall, named Pasquino, whose generous behaviour, and gracefullactions (in bringing her dayly wooll to spin, by reason his Master wasa Clothier) prevailed upon her liking and affection.

　　Nor was he negligent in the observation of her amorous regards,but the Tinder tooke, and his soule flamed with the selfe same fire;making him as desirous of her loving acceptance, as possibly she couldbe of his: so that the commanding power of love, could not easily bedistinguished in which of them it had the greater predominance. Forevery day as he brought her fresh supply of woolles, and found herseriously busied at her wheele: her soule would vent forth manydeepe sighes, and those sighes fetch floods of teares from her eyes,thorough the singular good opinion she had conceyved of him, andearnest desire to enjoy him. Pasquino on the other side, as leysuregave him leave for the least conversing with her: his disease wasevery way answerable to hers, for teares stood in his eyes, sighesflew abroad, to ease the poore hearts afflicting oppressions, whichthough he was unable to conceale; yet would he seeme to clowd themcleanly, by entreating her that his Masters worke might be neatlyperformed, and with such speed as time would permit her, intermixinginfinite praises of her artificiall spinning; and affirming withall,that the Quilles of Yearne received from her, were the choisest beautyof the whole peece; so that when other workewomen played, Simonida wassure to want no employment.

　　Hereupon, the one soliciting, and the other taking delight inbeing solicited; it came to passe, that often accesse bred thebolder courage, and over-much bashfulnesse became abandoned, yet noimmodesty passing betweene them: but affection grew the bettersetled in them both, by interchangeable vowes of constantperseverance, so that death onely, but no disaster else had power todivide them. Their mutuall delight continuing on in this manner,with more forcible encreasing of their Loves equall flame: itfortuned, that Pasquino sitting by Simonida, told her of a goodlyGarden, whereto he was desirous to bring her, to the end, that theymight the more safely converse together, without the suspition ofenvious eyes. Simonida gave answer of her wellliking the motion, andacquainting her Father therewith, he gave her leave, on the Sundayfollowing after dinner, to go fetch the pardon of S. Gallo, andafterwards to visit the Garden.

　　A modest yong maiden named Lagina, following the same profession,and being an intimate familiar friend, Simonida tooke along in hercompany, and came to the Garden appointed by Pasquino; where she foundhim readily expecting her comming, and another friend also with him,called Puccino (albeit more usually tearmed Strambo) a secretwell-willer to Lagina, whose love became the more furthered by hisfriendly meeting. Each Lover delighting in his hearts chosenMistresse, caused them to walke alone by themselves, as thespaciousnesse of the Garden gave them ample liberty: Puccino withhis Lagina in one part, and Pasquino with his Simonida in another. Thewalke which they had made choise of, was by a long and goodly bed ofSage, turning and returning by the same bed their conference ministredoccasion, and as they pleased to recreate themselves, affecting ratherto continue still there, then in any part of the Garden.

　　One while they would sit downe by the Sage bed, and afterward riseto walke againe, as ease and wearinesse seemed to invite them. Atlength, Pasquino chanced to crop a leafe of the Sage, wherewith heboth rubbed his teeth and gummes, and champing it betweene themalso, saying; that there was no better thing in the world to cleansethe teeth withall, after feeding. Not long had he thus champed theSage in his teeth, returning to his former kinde of discoursing, buthis countenance began to change very pale, his sight failed, andspeech forsooke him; so that (in briefe) he fell downe dead. Whichwhen Simonida beheld, wringing her hands, she cryed out for helpe toStrambo and Lagina, who immediately came running to her. Theyfinding Pasquino not onely to be dead, but his body swolne, andstrangely over-spred with foule black spots, both on his face,hands, and all parts else beside: Strambo cried out, saying; Ah wickedmaide, what hast thou poisoned him?

　　These words and their shrill out-cries also were heard by Neighboursdwelling neere to the Garden, who comming in sodainly uppon them,and seeing Pasquino lying dead, and hugely swoln, Strambo likewisecomplaining, and accusing Simonida to have poysoned him; she making noanswer, but standing in a gastly amazement, all her senses meerelyconfounded, at such a strange and uncouth accident, in loosing himwhom she so dearely loved: knew not how to excuse-her selfe, andtherefore every one verily beleeved, that Strambo had not unjustlyaccused her. Poore wofull maide, thus was she instantly apprehended,and drowned in her teares, they led her along to the Potes. tatesPalace, where her accusation was justified by Strambo, Lagina, and twomen more; the one named Atticciato, and the other Malagevole, fellowesand companions with Pasquino, who came into the Garden also upon theout-cry.

　　The Judge, without any delay at all, gave eare to the busines, andexamined the case very strictly: but could by no meanes comprehend,that any malice should appeare in her towards him, nor that she wasguiltie of the mans death. Wherefore, in the presence of Simonida,he desired to see the dead body, and the place where he fell downedead, because there he intended to have her relate, how she saw theaccident to happen, that her owne speeches might the sooner condemneher, whereas the case yet remained doubtfull, and farre beyond hiscomprehension. So, without any further publication, and to avoid thefollowing of the turbulent multitude, they departed from the benchof Justice, and came to the place, where Pasquinoes body lay swolnelike a Tunne. Demanding there questions, concerning his behaviour,when they walked there in conference together, and, not a littleadmiring the manner of his death, while he stood advisedly consideringthereon.

　　She going to the bed of Sage, reporting the whole precedent history,even from the originall to the ending: the better to make the caseunderstood, without the least colour of ill carriage towardesPasquino; according as she had seene him do, even so o she pluckeanother leafe of the Sage, rubbing her teeth therewith, and champingit as he formerly did. Strambo, and the other intimate friends ofPasquino, having noted in what manner she used the Sage, and thisappearing as her utmost refuge, either to acquit or condemne her: inpresence of the Judge they smiled thereat, mocking and deridingwhatsoever she saide, or did, and desiring (the more earnestly) thesentence of death against her, that her body might be consumed withfire, as a just punishment for her abhominable transgression.

　　Poore Simonida, sighing and sorrowing for her deere loves losse, and(perhappes) not meanly terrified, with the strict infliction oftorment so severely urged and followed by Strambo and the reststanding dumb still, without answering so much as one word; by tastingof the same Sage, fell downe dead by the bed, even by the likeaccident Pasquino formerly did, to the admirable astonishment of allthere present.

　　Oh poore infortunate Lovers, whose Starres were so inauspicious toyou, as to finish both your mortall lives, and fervent love, inlesse limitation then a dayes space. How to censure of your deaths,and happines to ensue thereon, by an accident so strange andinevitable: it is not within the compasse of my power, but to hope thebest, and so I leave you. But yet concerning Simonida her selfe, inthe common opinion of us that remaine living: her true vertue andinnocency (though Fortune was otherwise most cruell to her) wouldnot suffer her to sinke under the testimony of Strambo, Lagina,Atticciato, and Malagevole, being but carders of wool, or perhaps ofmeaner condition; a happier course was ordained for her, to passeclearely from their infamous imputation, and follow her Pasquino, inthe very same manner of death, and with such a speedy expedition.

　　The Judge standing amazed, and all there present in his company,were silent for a long while together: but, uppon betterrecollection of his spirits, thus he spake. This inconvenience whichthus hath hapned, and confounded our senses with no common admiration;in mine opinion concerneth the bed of Sage, avouching it either tobe venomous, or dangerously infected, which (neverthelesse) isseldom found in Sage. But to the end, that it may not be offensiveto any more hereafter, I will have it wholly digd up by the rootes,and then to be burnt in the open Market place.

　　Hereupon, the Gardiner was presently sent for, and before theJudge would depart thence, he saw the bed of Sage digged up by theroots, and found the true occasion, whereby these two poore Loverslost their lives. For, just in the middest of the bed, and at themaine roote, which directed all the Sage in growth; lay an huge mightyToad, even weltring (as it were) in a hole full of poyson; by meaneswhereof, in conjecture of the judge, and all the rest, the whole bedof Sage became envenomed, occasioning every leafe thereof to be deadlyin taste. None being so hardy, as to approach neere the Toade, theymade a pile of wood directly over it, and setting it on a flamingfire, threw all the Sage thereinto, and so they were consumedtogether. So ended all further suite in Law, concerning the deathsof Pasquino and Simonida: whose bodies being carried to the Churchof Saint Paul, by their sad and sorrowfull accusers, Strambo,Lagina, Atticciato and Malagevole, were buried together in onegoodly Monument, for a future memory of their hard Fortune.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE EIGHT NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS AGAINE DECLARED, THE GREAT INDISCRETION AND FOLLY OF

　　THEM, THAT THINK TO CONSTRAINE LOVE, ACCORDING TO THEIR WILL,

　　AFTER IT IS CONSTANTLY SETLED BEFORE: WITH OTHER

　　INSTRUCTIONS, CONCERNING THE UNSPEAKEABLE POWER OF LOVE

　　Jeronimo affecting a yong Maiden, named Silvestra, was constrained(by the earnest importunity of his Mother) to take a journey to Paris.At his return home from thence againe, he found his love Silvestramarried. By secret meanes, he got entrance into her house, and dyedupon the bed lying by her. Afterward, his body being carried toChurch, to receive buriall, she likewise died there instantly upon hiscoarse.

　　Madam Aemilia no sooner concluded her Novell, but Madam Neiphila (bythe Kings command) began to speake in this manner. It seemeth to me(Gracious Ladies) that there are some such people to be found, whoimagine themselves to know more, then all other else in the worldbeside, and yet indeede do know nothing at all: presuming (thoroughthis arrogant opinion of theirs) to imploy and oppose their senselesseunderstanding, against infallible grounded reason, yea, and to attemptcourses, not only contrary to the counsell and judgement of men, butalso to crosse the nature of divine ordination. Out of which saucy andambitious presumption, many mighty harmes have already hadbeginning, and more are like to ensue uppon such boldnesse, because itis the ground of all evils.

　　Now, in regard that among all other naturall things, no one is lessesubject to take counsell, or can be wrought to contrariety, then Love,whose nature is such, as rather to run upon his owne rash consumption,then to be ruled by admonitions of the very wisest: my memory hathinspired it selfe, with matter incident to this purpose, effectuallyto approve, what I have already said. For I am now to speake of awoman who would appeare to have more wit, then either she hadindeed, or appertained to her by any title. The matter also, whereinshe would needs shew her studious judgement and capacity, was ofmuch more consequence then she could deserve to meddle withall. Yetsuch was the issue of her fond presuming; that (in one instant) sheexpelled both love, and the soule of her owne sonne out of his body,where (doubtlesse) it was planted by divine favour and appointment.

　　In our owne City (according to true and ancient testimony) theredwelt sometime a very worthy and wealthy Merchant, named LeonardoSighiero, who by his wife had one onely Sonne, called Jeronimo; andwithin a short while after his birth, Leonardo being very sicke, andhaving setled all his affaires in good order; departed out of thiswretched life to a better. The Tutors and Governours of the Childe,thought it fittest to let him live with his Mother, where he had hiswhole education, though schooled among many other worthy neighbourschildren, according as in most Cities they use to do. Yong Jeronimogrowing on in yeares, and frequenting dayly the company of hisSchoole-fellowes and others: he would often sport (as the rest did)with the neighbors children, and much pretty pastime they foundtogether.

　　In the harmlesse recreations of youth, graver judgements haveoften observed, that some especiall matter received then suchoriginall, as greater effect hath followed thereon. And many times,parents and kindred have bene the occasion (although perhaps beyondtheir expectation) of very strange and extraordinary accidents, bynames of familiarity passing betweene Boyes and Girles, as King andQueene, sweet heart and sweet heart, friend and friend, husband andwife, and divers other such like kind tearmes, prooving afterwardsto be true indeed. It fell out so with our yong Jeronimo; for, among anumber of pretty Damosels, daughters to men of especiall respect,and others of farre inferiour quality: a Taylors daughter, excellingthe rest in favour and feature (albeit her Father was but poore)Jeronimo most delighted to sport withall; and no other titles passedbetweene them, even in the hearing of their parents and friends, butwife and husband: such was the beginning of their yong affection,presaging (no doubt) effectually to follow.

　　Nor grew this familiarity (as yet) any way distasted, till bytheir daily conversing together, and enterchange of infinite prettyspeeches, Jeronimo felt a strange alteration in his soule, with suchenforcing and powerfull afflictions; as he was never well but in hercompany, nor she enjoyed any rest if Jeronimo were absent. At thelength, this being noted by his Mother, she began to rebuke him, yeamany times gave him both threatnings and blowes, which proving to nopurpose, not hindering his accesse to her; she complained to hisTutors, and like one that in regard of her riches, thought to plant anOrange upon a blacke thorne, spake as followeth.

　　This Sonne of mine Jeronimo, being as yet but foureteene years ofage, is so deeply enamoured of a yong Girle, named Silvestra, daughterunto a poore Tailor, our neere dwelling neighbour: that if we do notsend him out of her company, one day (perhaps) he may make her hiswife, and yet without any knowledge of ours, which questionlesse wouldbe my death. Otherwise, he may pine and consume himselfe away, if hesee us procure her marriage to some other. Wherefore, hold it good,that to avoid so great an inconvenience, we should send Jeronimosome far distance hence, to remaine where some of our Factors areemployed: because, when he shall be out of her sight, and theiroften meetings utterly disappointed; his affection to her will thesooner cease, by frustrating his hope for ever enjoying her, and so weshall have the better meanes, to match him with one of greaterquality. The Tutors did like well of her advice, not doubting but itwould take answerable effect: and therefore, calling Jeronimo into aprivate Parlor, one of them began in this manner.

　　Jeronimo, you are now growne to an indifferent stature, and (almost)able to take government of your selfe. It cannot then seeme any wayinconvenient, to acquaint you with your deceased Fathers affaires, andby what good courses he came to such wealth. You are his onely sonneand heire, to whom he hath bequeathed his rich possessions (yourMothers moity evermore remembred) and travaile would now seeme fittingfor you, as well to gaine experience in Trafficke and Merchandize,as also to let you see the worlds occurrences. Your Mother therefore(and we have thought it expedient) that you should journey fromhence to Paris, there to continue for some such fitting time, as maygrant you full and free opportunity, to survey what stocke of wealthis there employed for you, and to make you understand, how yourFactors are furtherous to your affaires. Beside, this is the way tomake you a man of more solid apprehension, and perfect instructionin civill courses of life; rather then by continuing here to seenone but Lords, Barons, and Gentlemen, whereof we have too great anumber. When you are sufficiently qualified there, and have learnedwhat belongeth to a worthy Marchant, such as was Leonardo Sighieroyour famous Father; you may returne home againe at your owne pleasure.

　　The youth gave them attentive hearing, and (in few words) returnedthem answer: That he would not give way to any such travaile,because he knew how to dispose of himselfe in Florence, as well asin any other place he should be sent too. Which when his Tutors heard,they reproved him with many severe speeches: and seeing they could winno other answer from him, they made returne thereof to his Mother. Shestorming extreamly thereat, yet not so much for denying the journey toParis, as in regard of his violent affection to the Maide; gave himvery bitter and harsh language. All which availing nothing, shebegan to speake in a more milde and gentle straine, entreating himwith flattering and affable words, to be governed in this case byhis Tutors good advice. And so farre (in the end) she prevailed withhim, that he yeelded to live at Paris for the space of a yeare, butfurther time he would not grant, and so all was ended.

　　Jeronimo being gone to remaine at Paris, his love daily increasingmore and more, by reason of his absence from Silvestra, under faireand friendly promises, of this moneth, and the next moneth, sendingfor him home; there they detained him two whole yeares together.Whereuppon, his love was growne to stich an extremity, that he neitherwould, or could abide any longer there, but home he returned, beforehe was expected. His love Silvestra, by the cunning compacting ofhis Mother and Tutors, he found married to a Tent-makers Sonne;whereat he vexed and greeved beyond all measure. Neverthelesse, seeingthe case was now no way to be holpen; he strove to beare it with somuch patience, as so great a wrong, and his hearts tormentinggreefe, would give leave to doe.

　　Having found out the place where she dwelt, he began (as it is thecustome of yong Lovers) to use divers daily walkes by her doore: asthinking in his minde, that her remembrance of him was constantlycontinued, as his was most intirely fixed on her. But the case wasvery strangely altred, because she was now growne no more mindfullof him, then if she had never seene him before. Or if she did anyway remember him, it appeared to be so little, that manifest signesdeclared the contrary. Which Jeronimo very quickely perceived,albeit not without many melancholly perturbations. Notwithstanding, helaboured by all possible meanes, to recover her former kindnesseagaine: but finding all his paines frivolously employed; he resolvedto dye, and yet to compasse some speech with her before.

　　By meanes of a neere dwelling neighbour (that was his very deare andintimate friend) he came acquainted with every part of the house,and prevailed so far, that one evening, when she and her husbandsupt at a neighbours house; he compassed accesse into the same bedchamber, where Silvestra used most to lodge. Finding the Curtainesready drawne, he hid himselfe behinde them on the further side ofthe bed, and so tarried there untill Silvestra and her husband werereturned home, and laide downe in bed to take their rest. The husbandssences were soone overcome with sleepe, by reason of his painefulltoyling all the day, and bodies that are exercised with much labour,are the more desirous to have ease.

　　She staying up last, to put out the light, and hearing her husbandsleepe so soundly, that his snoring gave good evidence thereof:layed her selfe downe the more respectively, as being very loath anyway to disease him, but sweetly to let him enjoy his rest.

　　Silvestra lay on the same side of the bed, where Jeronimo had hidhimselfe behinde the Curtaines; who stepping softly to her in thedarke, and laying his hand gently on her brest, saide: Deare Love,forbeare a little while to sleepe, for heere is thy loyall friendJeronimo. The yong woman starting with amazement, would have criedout, but that he entreated her to the contrary; protesting, that hecame for no ill intent to her, but onely to take his latest leave ofher. Alas Jeronimo (quoth she) those idle dayes are past and gone,when it was no way unseemly for our youth, to entertaine equality ofthose desires, which then well agreed with our young blood. Sincewhen, you have lived in forraine Countries, which appeared to me toalter your former disposition: for, in the space of two wholeyeares, either you grew forgetfull of me (as change of ayre, maychange affection) or (at the best) made such account of me, as I neverheard the least salutation from you. Now you know me to be a marriedwife, in regard whereof, my thoughts have embraced that chaste andhonourable resolution, not to minde any man but my husband; andtherefore, as you are come hither Without my love or license, so inlike manner I do desire you to be gone. Let this priviledge of myHusbandes sound sleeping, be no colour to your longer continuing here,or encourage you to finde any further favour at mine hand: for if minehusband should awake, beside the danger that thereon may follow toyou, I cannot but loose the sweet happinesse of peacefull life,which hitherto we have both mutually embraced.

　　The yong man, hearing these wordes, and remembring what lovingkindnesse he had formerly found, what secret love Letters he hadsent from Paris, with other private intelligences and tokens, whichnever came to her receite and knowledge, so cunningly his Mother andTutors had carried the matter: immediately felt his heart-strings tobreake, and lying downe upon the beds side by her, uttered these hisvery last words. Silvestra farewell, thou hast kilde the kindest heartthat ever loved a woman: and speaking no more, gave up the ghost.She hearing these words delivered with an entire sighe, anddeepe-fetcht groane, did not imagine the strange consequence followingthereon; yet was mooved to much compassion, in regard of her formeraffection to him. Silent she lay an indifferent while, as being unableto returne him any answer, and looking when he would be gone,according as before she had earnestly entreated him. But when sheperceyved him to lye so still, as neither word or motion came fromhim, she saide: Kinde Jeronimo, why doest thou not depart and get theegone? So putting forth her hand, it hapned to light upon his face,which she felt to be as cold as yce: whereat marvailing not alittle, as also at his continued silence, she jogged him, and felt hishands in like manner, which were stiffely extended forth, and allhis body cold, as not having any life remaining in him, whichgreatly amazing her, and confounding her with sorrow beyond allmeasure, she was in such perplexity, that she could not devise what todo or say.

　　In the end, she resolved to try how her husband would take it,that so strange an accident should thus happen in his house, andputting the case as if it did not concerne them, but any other ofthe neighbours; awaking him first, demaunded of him what was best tobe done, if a man should steale into a neighbours house, unknowne tohim, or any of his family; and in his bed chamber to be found dead. Hepresently replyed (as not thinking the case concerned himselfe)that, the onely helpe in such an unexpected extremity, was to take thedead body, and convey it to his owne house, if he had any; wherebyno scandall or reproach would follow to them, in whose house he had sounfortunately dyed. Hereupon she immediately arose, and lighting acandle, shewed him the dead body of Jeronimo, with protestation ofevery particular, both of her innocency, either of knowledge of hiscomming thither, or any other blame that could concerne her. Whichhe both constantly knowing and beleeving, made no more ceremony, butputting on his Garments, tooke the dead body upon his shoulders, andcarried it to the Mothers doore, where he left it, and afterwardreturned to his owne house againe.

　　When day light was come, and the dead body found lying in the Porch,it moved very much greefe and amazement, considering, he had bin seenethe day before, in perfect health to outward appearance. Nor needewe to urge any question of his Mothers sorrow upon this strangeaccident, who, causing his body to be carefully searched, withoutany blow, bruise, wound, or hurt uppon it, the Physitians could notgive any other opinion, but that some inward conceyte of greefe hadcaused his death, as it did indeed, and no way otherwise. To thecheefe Church was the dead body carried, to be generally seene ofall the people, his Mother and Friends weeping heavily by it, asmany more did the like beside, because he was beloved of every one. Inwhich time of universall mourning, the honest man (in whose house hedyed) spake thus to his wife: Disguise thy selfe in some decentmanner, and go to the Church, where (as I heare) they have laide thebody of Jeronimo. Crowde in amongest the Women, as I will do thelike amongst the men, to heare what opinion passeth of his death,and whether we shall be scandalized thereby, or no.

　　Silvestra, who was now become full of pitty too late, quickelycondiscended, as desiring to see him dead, whom sometime she dearlyaffected in life. And being come to the Church, it is a matter to beadmired, if advisedly we consider on the powerfull working of love;for the heart of this woman, which the prosperous fortune ofJeronimo could not pierce, now in his wofull death split in sunder;and the ancient sparks of love so long concealed in the embers,brake foorth into a furious flame; and being violently surprizedwith extraordinary compassion, no sooner did she come neere to thedead body, where many stood weeping round about it; but strangelyshrieking out aloud, she fell downe upon it: and even as extreamity ofgreefe finished his life, so did it hers in the same manner. For shemoved neither hand nor foot, because her vitall powers had quiteforsaken her. The women labouring to comfort her by all best meanesthey could devise; did not take any knowledge of her, by reason of herdisguised garments: but finding her dead indeed, and knowing heralso to be Silvestra, being overcome with unspeakable compassion,and danted with no meane admiration, they stood strangely gazingeach upon other.

　　Wonderfull crowds of people were then in the Church; and thisaccident being now noysed among the men, at length it came to herHusbands understanding, whose greefe was so great, as it exceededall capacity of expression. Afterward he declared what had hapned inhis house the precedent night, according as his wife had truly relatedto him, with all the speeches, which passed between Silvestra andJeronimo; by which discourse, they generally conceived, the certaineoccasion of both their sodaine deaths, which moved them to greatcompassion. Then taking the yong womans body, and ordering it as acoarse ought to be: they layed it on the same Biere by the yong man,and when they had sufficiently sorrowed for their disastrousfortune, they gave them honourable buriall both in. one grave. So,this poore couple, whom love (in life) could not joyne together, deathdid unite in an inseparable conjunction.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　WHEREBY APPEARETH, WHAT ILL SUCCESSE ATTENDETH ON THEM,

　　THAT LOVE CONTRARY TO REASON: IN OFFERING INJURIE BOTH TO

　　FRIENDSHIP AND MARRIAGE TOGETHER

　　Messer Guiglielmo of Rossiglione having slaine Messer GuiglielmoGuardastagno, whom hee imagined to love his wife, gave her his heartto eate. Which she knowing afterward, threw her selfe out of an highwindow to the ground; and being dead, was then buried with her friend.

　　When the Novell of Madam Neiphila was ended, which occasioned muchcompassion in the whole assembly; the King who wold not infringe thepriviledge granted to Dioneus, no more remaining to speake but theytwo, began thus. I call to minde (gentle Ladies) a Novell, which(seeing we are so farre entred into the lamentable accidents ofsuccesselesse love), will urge you unto as much commisseration, asthat so lately reported to you. And so much the rather, because theperson of whom we are to speake, were of respective quality; whichapproveth the accident to be more cruell, then those whereof we haveformerly discoursed.

　　According as the people of Provence do report, there dweltsometime in that jurisdiction, two noble Knights, each wellpossessed of Castles and followers; the one being named MesserGuiglielmo de Rossiglione, and the other Messer GuiglielmoGuardastagno. Now, in regard that they were both valiant Gentlemen,and singularly expert in actions of Armes; they loved together themore mutually, and held it as a kinde of custome to be seene in allTiltes and Tournaments, or any other exercises of Armes, goingcommonly alike in their wearing garments. And although their Castlesstood about five miles distant each from other, yet were they daylyconversant together, as very loving and intimate friends. The one ofthem, I meane Messer Guiglielmo de Rossilione, had to wife a verygallant beautifull Lady, of whom Messer Guardastagno (forgetting thelawes of respect and loyall friendship) became overfondly enamoured,expressing the same by such outward meanes, that the Lady her selfetooke knowledge thereof, and not with any dislike, as it seemed, butrather lovingly entertained; yet she grew not so forgetfull of herhonour and estimation, as the other did of faith to his friend.

　　With such indiscretion was this idle love carried, that whether itsorted to effect, or no, I know not: but the husband perceived somesuch maner of behaviour, as he could not easily digest, nor thought itfitting to endure. Whereuppon, the league of friendly amity so longcontinued, began to faile in very strange fashion, and becameconverted into deadly hatred: which yet he very cunningly concealed,bearing an outward shew of constant friendship still, but (in hisheart) he had vowed the death of Guardastagno. Nothing wanted, butby what meanes it might best be effected, which fell out to be in thismanner. A publicke joust or Tourney, was proclaimed by sound ofTrumpet throughout all France, wherewith immediately, MesserGuiglielmo Rossiglione acquainted Messer Guardastagno, entreatinghim that they might further conferre theron together, and for thatpurpose to come and visit him, if he intended to have any hand inthe businesse. Guardastagno being exceeding glad of this accident,which gave him liberty to see his Mistresse, sent answer backe bythe messenger, that on the morrow at night, he would come and sup withRossiglione; who upon this reply, projected to himselfe in whatmaner to kill him.

　　On the morrow, after dinner, arming himselfe, and two more of hisservants with him, such as he had solemnly sworne to secrecy, hemounted on horsebacke, and rode on about a mile from his owneCastle, where he lay closely ambushed in a Wood, through whichGuardastagno must needs passe. After he had stayed there some twohoures space and more, he espyed him come riding with two of hisattendants, all of them being unarmed, as no way distrusting anysuch intended treason. So soone as he was come to the place, wherehe had resolved to do the deed; hee rushed forth of the ambush, andhaving a sharpe Lance readily charged in his rest, ran mainly athim, saying: False villaine, thou art dead. Guardastagno, havingnothing wherewith to defend himselfe, nor his servants able to givehim any succour; being pierced quite through the body with theLance, downe he fell dead to the ground, and his men (fearing the likemisfortune to befall them) gallopped mainely backe againe to theirLords Castle, not knowing them who had thus murthered their Master, byreason of their armed disguises, which in those martiall times wereusually worne.

　　Messer Guiglielmo Rossiglione, alighting from his horse, andhaving a keene knife ready drawne in his hand; opened therewith thebrest of dead Guardastagno, and taking foorth his heart with hisowne hands, wrapped it in the Bandelote belonging to his Lance,commanding one of his men to the charge thereof, and never to disclosethe deed. So, mounting on horse-backe againe, and darke nightdrawing on apace, he returned home to his Castle. The Lady, who hadheard before of Guardastagnoes intent, to suppe there that night,and (perhaps) being earnestly desirous to see him; marvailing at hisso long tarrying, saide to her husband: Beleeve me Sir (quoth she)me thinkes it is somewhat strange, that Messer Guiglielmo Guardastagnodelayes his comming so long, he never used to do so till now. Ireceived tidings from him wife (saide he) that he cannot be heretill to morrow. Whereat the Lady appearing to be displeased, concealedit to herselfe, and used no more words.

　　Rossiglione leaving his Lady, went into the Kitchin, where callingfor the Cooke, he delivered him the heart, saying: Take this heartof a wilde Boare, which it was my good happe to kill this day, anddresse it in the daintiest manner thou canst devise to do; which beingso done, when I am set at the Table, send it to me in a silver dish,with sauce beseeming so dainty a morsell. The Cooke tooke the heart,beleeving it to be no otherwise, then as his Lord had saide: and usinghis utmost skill in dressing it, did divide it into artificiallsmall slices, and made it most pleasing to be tasted. When supper timewas come, Rossiglione sate downe at the table with his Lady: but hehad little or no appetite at all to eate, the wicked deed which he haddone so perplexed his soule, and made him to sit very strangelymusing. At length, the Cooke brought in the dainty dish, which hehimselfe setting before his wife, began to finde fault with his ownelacke of stomacke, yet provoked her with many faire speeches, totast the Cooks cunning in so rare a dish.

　　The Lady having a good appetite indeede, when she had first tastedit, fed afterward so heartily thereon, that she left very little, ornone at all remaining. When he perceived that all was eaten, he saidunto her: Tell me Madame, how you do like this delicate kinde ofmeate? In good faith Sir (quoth she) in all my life I was never betterpleased. Now trust mee Madame, answered the Knight, I do verilybeleeve you, nor do I greatly wonder thereat, if you like that dead,which you loved so dearly being alive. When she heard these words, along while she sate silert, but afterward saide. I pray you tell meSir; what meate was this which you have made me to eate? Muse nolonger (saide he) for therein I will quickly resolve thee. Thou hasteaten the heart of Messer Guiglielmo Guardastagno, whose love was sodeare and precious to thee, thou false, perfidious, and disloyallLady: I pluckt it out of his vile body with mine owne hands, andmade my Cooke to dresse it for thy diet.

　　Poore Lady, how strangely was her soule afflicted, hearing theseharsh and unpleasing speeches? Teares flowed aboundantly from herfaire eies, and like tempestuous windes embowelled in the earth, sodid vehement sighes breake mainly from her heart, and after atedious time of silence, she spake in this manner. My Lord andhusband, you have done a most disloyall and damnable deede,misguided by your owne wicked jealous opinion, and not by any justcause given you, to murther so worthy and Noble a Gentleman. I protestunto you upon my soule, which I wish to be confounded in eternallperdition, if ever I were unchaste to your bed, or allowed him anyother favour, but what might well become so honourable a friend. Andseeing my body hath bene made the receptacle for so precious a kindeof foode, as the heart of so valiant and courteous a Knight, such aswas the Noble Guardastagno; never shall any other foode hereafter,have entertainment there, or my selfe live the Wife to so bloody aHusband.

　　So starting up from the Table, and stepping unto a great gazingWindow, the Casement whereof standing wide open behinde her: violentlyshee leaped out thereat, which beeing an huge height in distancefrom the ground, the fall did not onely kill her, but also shiveredher body into many peeces. Which Rossiglione perceiving, hee stoodelike a body without a soule, confounded with the killing of so deare afriend, losse of a chaste and honourable wife, and all through hisowne overcredulous conceit.

　　Upon further conference with his private thoughts, and remorsefullacknowledgement of his heinous offence, which repentance (too late)gave him eyes now to see, though rashnesse before would not permit himto consider; these two extreamities inlarged his dulled understanding.First, he grew fearfull of the friends and followers to murtheredGuardastagno, as also the whole Country of Provence, in regard ofthe peoples generall love unto him; which being two maine andimportant motives, both to the detestation of so horrid an act, andimmediate severe revenge to succeede thereon: he made such provisionas best he could, and as so sodaine a warning would give leave, he Redaway secretly in the night season.

　　These unpleasing newes were soone spread abroad the next morning,not only of the unfortunate accidents, but also of Rossiglions flight;in regard whereof, the dead bodyes being found, and broughttogether, as well by the people belonging to Guardastagno, as themthat attended on the Lady: they were layed in the Chappell ofRossigliones Castle; where, after so much lamentation for so great amisfortune to befall them, they were honourably enterred in onefaire Tombe, with excellent Verses engraven thereon, expressing boththeir noble degree, and by what unhappy meanes, they chanced to haveburiall in that very place.

　　THE FOURTH DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THAT SOMETIME BY ADVENTUROUS ACCIDENT,

　　RATHER THEN ANY REASONABLE COMPREHENSION, A MAN MAY ESCAPE OUT OF

　　MANIFOLD PERILLES, BUT ESPECIALLY IN OCCURRENCES OF LOVE.

　　A physitians wife laide a Lover of her Maides (supposing him to bedead) in a Chest, by reason that he had drunke Water, which usuallywas given to procure a sleepy entrancing. Two Lombard usurers,stealing the Chest, in hope of a rich booty, carryed it into theirowne house, where afterward the man awaking, was apprehended for aTheefe. The Chamber-maide to the Physitians wife, going before thebench of Justice, accuseth her selfe for putting the imagined deadbody into the Chest, by which meanes he escapeth hanging. And thetheeves which stole away the Chest, were condemned to pay a greatsumme of money.

　　After that the King had concluded his Novell, there remained nonenow but Dioneus to tell the last: which himselfe confessing, and theKing commaunding him to proceede, hee beganne in this manner. Somany miseries of unfortunate Love, as all of you have already related,hath not onely swolne your eyes with weeping, but also made sickeour hearts with sighing: yea (Gracious Ladies) I my selfe finde myspirits not meanly afflicted thereby. Wherefore the whole day hathbene very irkesome to me, and I am not a little glad, that it is soneere ending. Now, for the better shutting it up altogether, I wouldbe very loath to make an addition, of any more such sad andmournfull matter, good for nothing but onely to feede melanchollyhumor, and from which (I hope) my faire Starres will defend me.Tragicall discourse, thou art no fit companion for me, I willtherefore report a Novell which may minister a more joviall kinde ofargument, unto whose Tales that must be told to morrow, and with theexpiration of our present Kings reigne, to rid us of allheart-greeving hereafter.

　　Know then (most gracious assembly) that it is not many yeeres since,when there lived in Salerne, a very famous Physitian, named SignieurMazzeo della Montagna, who being already well entred into yeeres,would (neverthelesse) marrie with a beautifull young Mayden of theCity, bestowing rich garments, gaudie attyres, Ringes, and Jewelles onher, such as few Women else could any way equall, because hee lovedher most deerely. Yet being an aged man, and never remembring, howvaine and idle a thing it is, for age to make such an unfittingElection, injurious to both; and therefore endangering that domestickeagreement, which ought to be the sole and maine comfort of Marriage:it maketh me therefore to misdoubt, that as in our former Tale ofSigniour Ricciardo de Cinzica, some dayes of the Calender did hereseeme as distastefull, as those that occasioned the other Womansdiscontentment. In such unequall choyses, Parents commonly are moreblamewoorthy, then any imputation, to bee layde on the young Women,who gladdely would enjoy such as in heart they have elected: butthat their Parents, looking through the glasse of greedie lucre, doeoverthrow both their owne hopes, and the faire fortunes of theirchildren together.

　　Yet to speake uprightly of this young married Wife, she declared herselfe to be of a wise and chearfull spirit, not discoraged with herunequalitie of marriage: but bearing all with a contented browe, forfeare of urging the very least mislike in her Husband. And he, onthe other side, when occasions did not call him to visite hisPatients, or to be present at the Colledge among his fellow-Doctours,would alwayes bee chearing and comforting his Wife, as one that couldhardly affoord to be out of her company. There is one especiallfatall misfortune, which commonly awaiteth on olde Mens marriages;when freezing December will match with flourishing May, and greenedesires appeare in age, beyond all possibility of performance. Norare there wanting good store of wanton Gallants, who hating to seeBeauty in this manner betrayed, and to the embraces of a loathed bed,will make their folly seene in publike appearance, and by their dailyproffers of amorous services (seeming compassionate of the womansdisaster) are usually the cause of jealous suspitions, and veryheinous houshold discontentments.

　　Among divers other, that faine would be nibling at this bayte ofbeautie, there was one, named Ruggiero de Jeroly, of honourableparentage, but yet of such a beboshed and disordered life, asneither Kindred or Friends, were willing to take any knowledge of him,but utterly gave him over to his dissolute courses: so that,throughout all Salerne, his conditions caused his generall contempt,and he accounted no better but even as a theeving and lewde company.The Doctours Wife, had a Chamber-maide attending on her; who,notwithstanding all the ugly deformities in Ruggiero, regarding morehis person then his imperfections (because he was a compleate andwell-featured youth) bestowed her affection most entirely on him,and oftentimes did supplie his wants, with her owne best meanes.

　　Ruggiero having this benefite of the Maides kinde love to him,made it an hopefull mounting Ladder, whereby to derive some goodliking from the Mistresse, presuming rather on his outward comelyparts, then any other honest qualitie that might commend him. TheMistresse knowing what choise her Maide had made, and unable by anyperswasions to remoove her, tooke knowledge of Ruggieroes privateresorting to her house, and in meere love to her Maide (who had verymany especiall deservings in her) oftentimes she would (in kindemanner) rebuke him, and advise him to a more settled course of life;which counsell, that it might take the better effect; she gracedwith liberall gifts: one while with Golde, others with Silver, andoften with garments, for his comelier accesse thither; which bounty,he (like a lewde mistaker) interpreted as assurances of heraffection to him, and that he was more gracefull in her eye, thenany man else could be.

　　In the continuance of these proceedings, it came to passe, thatMaster Doctor Mazzeo (being not onely a most expert Physitian, butlikewise as skilfull in Chirurgerie beside) had a Patient in cure, whoby great misfortune, had one of his legges broken all in pieces; whichsome weaker judgement having formerly dealt withall, the bones andsinewes were become so fowly putrified, as he tolde the partiesfriends, that the legge must be quite cut off, or else the Patientmust needes dye: yet he intended so to order the matter, that theperill should proceede no further, to prejudice any other part ofthe body. The case beeing thus resolved on with the Pacient and hisFriends, the day and time was appointed when the deede should be done:and the Doctor conceiving, that except the Patient were sleepilyentranced, he could not by any meanes endure the paine, but mustneedes hinder what he meant to do: by distillation he made such anartificiall Water, as (after the Patient hath received it) it willprocure a kinde of a dead sleepe, and endure so long a space, asnecessity requireth the use there of, in full performance of theworke.

　　After he had made this sleepy water, he put it into a glasse,wherewith it was filled (almost) up to the brimme; and till the timecame when he should use it, hee set it in his owne Chamber-Window,never acquainting any one, to what purpose he had provided thewater, nor what was his reason of setting it there; when it drewtowards the evening, and he was returned home from his pacients, aMessenger brought him Letters from Malfy, concerning a greatconflict happening there betweene two Noble Families, wherein diverswere very dangerously wounded on either side, and without his speedyrepairing thither, it would prove to the losse of many lives.Hereupon, the cure of the mans leg must needs be prolonged, untillhe was returned backe againe, in regard that many of the woundedpersons were his worthy friends, and liberall bounty was there to beexpected, which made him presently go aboord a small Barke, andforthwith set away towards Malfy.

　　This absence of Master Doctor Mazzeo, gave opportunity toadventurous Ruggiero, to visite his house (he being gone) in hope toget more Crownes, and curtisie from the Mistresse, under formallcolour of courting the Maide. And being closely admitted into thehouse, when divers Neighbours were in conference with her Mistresse,and held her with much pleasing discourse, as required longer timethen was expected: the Maide, had no other roome to concealeRuggiero in, but onely the bed Chamber of her Master, where shelockt him in; because none of the houshold people should descry him,and stayed attending on her Mistris, till all the Guests tooke theirleave, and were gone. Ruggiero thus remayning alone in the Chamber,for the space of three long houres and more was visited neither byMaide nor Mistris, but awaited when he should be set at liberty.

　　Now, whether feeding on salt meates before his coming thither, orcustomary use of drinking, which maketh men unable any long while toabstaine as being never satisfied with excesse; which of these twoextreames they were, I know not: but drinke needs he must. And, havingno other meanes for quenching his thirst, espied the glasse of waterstanding in the Window, and thinking it to be some soveraigne kinde ofwater, reserved by the Doctor for his owne drinking, to make him lustyin his old yeeres, he tooke the glasse; and finding the water pleasingto his pallate, dranke it off every drop; then sitting downe on aCoffer by the beds side, soone after he fell into a sound sleepe,according to the powerfull working of the water.

　　No sooner were all the Neighbours gone, and the Maide at libertyfrom her Mistresse, but unlocking the doore, into the Chamber shewent; and finding Ruggiero sitting fast asleepe, she began to hunchand punche him, entreating him (softly) to awake: but all was to nopurpose, for he neither moved, or answered one word; whereat herpatience being somewhat provoked, she punched him more rudely, andangerly saide: Awake for shame thou drowsie dullard, and if thou be sodesirous of sleeping, get thee home to thine owne lodging, becausethou art not allowed to sleepe here. Ruggiero being thus rudelypunched, fell from off the Coffer flat on the ground, appearing noother in all respects, then as if he were a dead body. Whereat theMaide being fearfully amazed, plucking him by the nose and youngbeard, and what else she could devise to do, yet all her labourproving still in vaine: she was almost beside her wits, stamping andraving all about the roome, as if sense and reason had forsaken her;so violent was her extreame distraction.

　　Upon the hearing of this noise, her Mistris came sodainely intothe Chamber, where being affrighted at so strange an accident, andsuspecting that Ruggiero was dead indeed: she pinched him strongly,and burnt his finger with a candle, yet all was as fruitelesse asbefore. Then sitting downe, she began to consider advisedly with herselfe, how much her honour and reputation would be endangeredhereby, both with her Husband, and in vulgar opinion when thisshould come to publike notice. For (quoth she to her Maide) it isnot thy fond love to this unruly fellow that can sway the censure ofthe monster multitude, in beleeving his accesse hither onely tothee: but my good name, and honest repute, as yet untoucht with thevery least taxation, will be rackt on the tenter of infamousjudgement, and (though never so cleare) branded with generallcondemnation. It is wisedome therefore, that we should make no noisebut (in silence) consider with our selves, how to cleare the houseof this dead body, by some such helpfull and witty device, as whenit shall be found in the morning, his being here may passe withoutsuspition, and the worlds rash opinion no way touch US.

　　Weeping and lamenting is now laid aside, and all hope in them of hislives restoring: onely to rid his body but of the house, that nowrequires their care and cunning: whereupon the Maide thus began.Mistresse (quoth she) this evening, although it was very late, atour next Neighbours doore (who you know is a joyner by his trade) Isaw a great Chest stand; and, as it seemeth, for a publike sale,because two or three nights together, it hath not bene thence removed:and if the owner have not lockt it, all invention else cannotfurnish us with the like helpe. For therein will we lay his body,whereon I will bestow two or three wounds with my Knife, and leavinghim so, our house can be no more suspected concerning his beinghere, then any other in the streete beside; nay rather farre lesse, inregard of your husbands credite and authority. Moreover, hereof I amcertaine, that he being of such bad and disordered qualities: itwill the more likely be imagined, that he was slaine by some of hisown loose companions, being with them about some pilfering busines,and afterward hid his body in the chest, it standing so fitly forthe purpose, and darke night also favouring the deed.

　　The Maids counsell past under the seale of allowance, only herMistris thought it not convenient, that (having affected hirn sodeerely) she should mangle his body with any wounds; but rather to letit be gathered by more likely-hood, that villaines had strangledhim, and then conveyed his body into the Chest. Away she sends theMaide, to see whether the Chest stood there still, or no; as indeedeit did, and unlockt, whereof they were not a little joyfull. By thehelpe of her Mistresse, the Maide tooke Ruggiero upon her shoulders,and bringing him to the doore, with dilligent respect that no onecould discover them; in the Chest they laide him, and so there lefthim, closing downe the lidde according as they found it.

　　In the same streete, and not farre from the joyner, dwelt two yongmen who were Lombards, living upon the interest of their moneyes,coveting to get much, and to spend little. They having observedwhere the Chest stood, and wanting a necessary mooveable tohoushold, yet loath to lay out money for buying it: complottedtogether this very night, to steale it thence, and carry it home totheir house, as accordingly they did; finding it somewhat heavy, andtherefore imagining, that matter of woorth was contained therein. Inthe Chamber where their wives lay, they left it; and so without anyfurther search till the next morning, they laid them downe to restlikewise.

　　Ruggiero, who had now slept a long while, the drinke being digested,and the vertue thereof fully consummated; began to awake before day.And although his naturall sleepe was broken, and his senses hadrecovered their former power, yet notwithstanding, there remained suchan astonishment in his braine, as not onely did afflict him all theday following, but also divers dayes and nights afterward. Havinghis eyes wide open, and yet not discerning any thing, he stretchedforth his armes every where about him, and finding himselfe to beenclosed in the Chest, he grew more broad awake, and said to himselfe.What is this? Where am I? Do I wake or steepe? Full well I remember,that not long since I was in my sweet-hearts Chamber, and now (methinkes) I am mewed up in a Chest. What should I thinke hereof? IsMaster Doctor returned home, or hath some other inconvenience happned,whereby finding me a sleepe, she was enforced to hide me thus?Surely it is so, and otherwise it cannot be: wherefore, it is best forme to lye still, and listen when I can heare any talking in theChamber.

　　Continuing thus a longer while then otherwise he would have done,because his lying in the bare Chest was somewhat uneasie andpainfull to him; turning divers times on the one side, and then asoften againe on the other, coveting still for ease, yet could notfinde any: at length, he thrust his backe so strongly against theChests side, that (it standing on an un-even ground) it began tototter, and after fell downe. In which fall, it made so loud anoise, as the women (lying in the beds standing by) awaked, and wereso overcome with feare, that they had not the power to speake oneword. Ruggiero also being affrighted with the Chests fall, andperceiving how by that meanes it was become open, he thought itbetter, least some other sinister fortune should befall him, to beat open liberty, then inclosed up so strictly. And because he knew notwhere he was, as also hoping to meete with his Mistresse; he wentall about groping in the darke, to find either some staires ordoore, whereby to get forth.

　　When the Women (being then awake) heard his trampling, as also hisjustling against the doores and windowes; they demaunded, Who wasthere? Ruggiero, not knowing their voyces, made them no answer;wherefore they called to their husbands, who lay very soundly sleepingby them, by reason of their so late walking abroad, and thereforeheard not this noise in the house. This made the Women much moretimorous, and therefore rising out of their beddes, they opened theCasement towards the streete, crying out aloude, Theeves, Theeves. Theneighbours arose upon this outcry, running up and downe from placeto place, some engirting the house, and others entering into it: bymeans of which troublesome noise, the two Lombards awaked, and seizingthere upon poore Ruggiero (who was well-neere affrighted out of hiswittes, at so strange an accident, and his owne ignorance, how hehappened thither, and how to escape from them) he stood gazing on themwithout any answer.

　　By this time, the Sergeants and other Officers of the City,ordinarily attending on the Magistrate, being raised by the tumultof this uproare, were come into the house, and had poore Ruggierocommitted unto their charge: who bringing him before the Governor, wasforthwith called in question, and known to be of a most wicked life, ashame to all his friends and kindred. He could say little forhimselfe, never denying his taking in the house, and thereforedesiring to finish all his fortunes together, desperately confessed,that he came with a fellonious intent to rob them, and the Governorgave him sentence to be hanged.

　　Soone were the newes spread throughout Salerne; that Ruggiero wasapprehended, about robbing the house of the two usuring Lombardes:which when Mistresse Doctor and her Chamber-maide heard, they wereconfounded with most strange admiration, and scarsely credited whatthey themselves had done the night before, but rather imagined allmatters past, to be no more than meerely a dreame, concerningRuggieroes dying in the house, and their putting him into the Chest,so that by no likely or possible meanes, he could be the man in thisperillous extreamitie.

　　In a short while after, Master Doctor Mazzeo was returned fromMalfy, to proceede in his cure of the poore mans legge; and callingfor his glasse of Water, which he left standing in his owne Chamberwindow, it was found quite empty, and not a drop in it: whereat heraged so extreamly, as never had the like impatience bene noted inhim. His wife, and her Maide, who had another kinde of businesse intheir braine, about a dead man so strangely come to life againe,knew not well what to say; but at the last, his Wife thus replyedsomewhat angerly. Sir (quoth she) what a coyle is here about apaltry glasse of Water, which perhaps hath bene spilt, yet neytherof us faulty therein? Is there no more such water to be had in theworld? Alas deere Wife (saide he) you might repute it to be a commonkinde of Water, but indeed it was not so; for I did purposely compoundit, onely to procure a dead seeming sleepe: And so related the wholematter at large, of the Pacients legge, and his Waters losse.

　　When she had heard these words of her husband, presently sheconceived, that the water was drunke off by Ruggiero, which had sosleepily entranced his sences, as they verily thought him to bedead, wherefore she saide. Beleeve me Sir, you never acquainted uswith any such matter, which would have procured more carefullrespect of it: but seeing it is gone, your skill extendeth to makemore, for now there is no other remedy. While thus Master Doctor andhis Wife were conferring together, the Maide went speedily into theCity, to understand truly, whither the condemned man was Ruggiero, andwhat would now become of him. Being returned home againe, and alonewith her Mistresse in the Chamber, thus she spake. Now trust meMistresse, not one in the City speaketh well of Ruggiero, who is theman condemned to dye; and, for ought I can perceive, he hath neitherKinsman nor Friend that will doe any thing for him; but he is leftwith the Provost, and must be executed to morrow morning. MoreoverMistresse, by such instructions as I have received, I can well-neereinforme you, by what meanes he came to the two Lombards house, ifall be true that I have heard.

　　You know the joyner before whose doore the Chest stoode, whereinwe did put Ruggiero; there is now a contention betweene him andanother man, to whom (it seemeth) the Chest doth belong; in regardwhereof, they are ready to quarrell extreamly each with other. For theone owing the Chest, and trusting the joyner to sell it for him, wouldhave him to pay him for the Chest. The joyner denieth any salethereof, avouching, that the last night it was stolne from hisdoore. Which the other man contrarying, maintaineth that he soldethe Chest to the two Lombard usurers, as himselfe is able toaffirme, because he found it in the house, when he (being present atthe apprehension of Ruggiero) sawe it there in the same house.Hereupon, the joyner gave him the lye, because he never sold it to anyman; but if it were there, they had robd him of it, as he would makeit manifest to their faces. Then falling into clamerous speechesthey went together to the Lombardes house, even as I returned home.Wherefore Mistresse, as you may easily perceive, Ruggiero was(questionlesse) carried thither in the Chest, and so there found;but how he revived againe, I cannot comprehend.

　　The Mistresse understanding now apparantly, the full effect of thewhole businesse, and in what manner it had bene carried, revealed tothe Maide her husbands speeches, concerning the glasse of sleepieWater, which was the onely engine of all this trouble, clearlyacquitting Ruggiero of the robbery, howsoever (in desparate fury,and to make an end of a life so contemptible) he had wrongfullyaccused himselfe. And notwithstanding this his hard fortune, whichhath made him much more infamous then before, in all the dissolutebehaviour of his life: yet it could not quaile her affection towardshim; but being loath he should dye for some other mans offence, andhoping his future reformation; she fell on her knees before herMistresse, and (drowned in her teares) most earnestly entreated her,to advise her with some such happy course, as might be the safety ofpoore Ruggieroes life. Mistresse Doctor, affecting her Maidedearely, and plainely perceiving, that no disastrous fortunewhatsoever, could alter her love to condemned Ruggiero; hoping thebest hereafter, as the Maide her selfe did, and willing to save liferather then suffer it to be lost without just cause, she directedher in such discreet manner, as you will better conceive by thesuccesse.

　　According as she was instructed by her Mistresse, she fell at thefeete of Master Doctor, desiring him to pardon a great error,whereby she had over-much offended him. As how? said Master Doctor. Inthis manner (quoth the Maide) and thus proceeded. You are not ignorantSir, what a lewde liver Ruggiero de Jeroly is, and notwithstanding allhis imperfections, how deerely I love him, as he protesteth the liketo me, and thus hath our love continued a yeere, and more. You beinggone to Malfy, and your absence granting me apt opportunity, forconference with so kinde a friend; I made the bolder, and gave himentrance into your house, yea even into mine owne Chamber, yet freefrom any abuse, neither did he (bad though he be) offer any. Thirstyhe was before his comming thither, either by salt meat, or distempereddiet, and I being unable to fetch him wine or water, by reason myMistresse sat in the Hall, seriously talking with her Sisters;remembred, that I saw a violl of Water standing in your ChamberWindow, which he drinking quite off, I set it empty in the placeagaine. I have heard your discontentment for the said Water, andconfesse my fault to you therein: but who liveth so justly, withoutoffending at one time or other? And I am heartily sory for mytransgression; yet not so much for the water, as the hard fortune thathath followed thereon; because thereby Ruggiero is in danger to losehis life, and all my hopes are utterly lost. Let me entreat youtherefore (gentle Master) first to pardon me, and then to grant mepermission, to succour my poore condemned friend, by all the bestmeanes I can devise.

　　When the Doctor had heard all her discourse, angry though he were,yet thus he answered with a smile. Much better had it bin, if thyfollies punishment had falne on thy selfe, that it might have paidethee with deserved repentance, upon thy Mistresses finding theesleeping. But go and get his deliverance if thou canst, with thiscaution, that if ever hereafter he be seene in my house, the perillthereof shall light on thy selfe. Receiving this answer, for her firstentrance into the attempt, and as her Mistresse had advised her, inall hast she went to the prison, where she prevailed so well withthe Jaylor, that hee granted her private conference with Ruggiero. Shehaving instructed him what he should say to the Provost, if he had anypurpose to escape with life; went thither before him to the Provost,who admitting her into his presence, and knowing that shee wasMaster Doctors Maid, a man especially respected of all the City, hewas the more willing to heare her message, he imagining that sheewas sent by her Master.

　　Sir (quoth shee) you have apprehended Ruggiero de Jeroly, as atheefe, and judgement of death is (as I heare) pronounced against him:but hee is wrongfully accused, and is clearly innocent of such aheinous detection. So entring into the History, she declared everycircumstance, from the originall to the end: relating truly, thatbeing her Lover, shee brought him into her Masters house, where hedranke the compounded sleepy water, and reputed for dead, she laidehim in the Chest. Afterward, she rehearsed the speeches betweene theJoyner, and him that laide claime to the Chest, giving him tounderstand thereby, how Ruggiero was taken in the Lombards house.

　　The Provost presently gathering, that the truth in this case waseasie to be knowne; sent first for Master Doctor Mazzeo, to know,whether he compounded any such water, or no: which he affirmed to betrue, and upon what occasion he prepared it. Then the Joyner, theowner of the Chest, and the two Lombards, being severally questionedwithall: it appeared evidently, that the Lombards did steale the Chestin the night season, and carried it home to their owne house. In theend, Ruggiero being brought from the prison, and demanded, where hewas lodged the night before, made answer, that he knew not where.Onely he well remembred, that bearing affection to the Chamber-maideof Master Doctor Mazzeo della Montagna, she brought him into aChamber, where a violl of water stoode in the Window, and he beingextreamly thirsty, dranke it off all. But what became of him afterward(till being awake, he found himselfe enclosed in a Chest, and in thehouse of the two Lombards) he could not say any thing.

　　When the Provost had heard all their answers, which he caused themto repeate over divers times, in regard they were very pleasing tohim: he cleared Ruggiero from the crime imposed on him, andcondemned the Lombards in three hundred Ducates, to be given toRuggiero in way of an amends, and to enable his marriage with theDoctors Mayde, whose constancie was much commended, and wrought such amiracle on penitent Ruggiero; that after his marriage, which wasgraced with great and honourable pompe, he regained the intimatelove of all his kindred, and lived in most Noble condition, even as ifhe had never bene any disordered man.

　　If the former Novels had made all the Ladies sad and sighe, thislast of Dioneus as much delighted them, as restoring them to theirformer jocond humor, and banishing Tragicall discourse for ever. TheKing perceiving that the Sun was neere setting, and his governmentas neere ending, with many kinde and courteous speeches, excusedhimselfe to the Ladies, for being the motive of such an argument, asexpressed the infelicity of poore Lovers. And having finished hisexcuse, up he rose, taking the Crown of Lawrell from off his ownehead, the Ladies awaiting on whose head he pleased next to set it,which proved to be the gracious Lady Fiammetta, and thus he spake.Here I place this Crowne on her head, that knoweth better then anyother, how to comfort this faire assembly to morrow, for the sorrowwhich they have this day endured.

　　Madame Fiammetta, whose lockes of haire were curled, long, andlike golden wiers, hanging somewhat downe over her white anddelicate shoulders, her visage round, wherein the Damaske Rose andLilly contended for priority, the eyes in her head, resembling thoseof the Faulcon messenger, and a dainty mouth; her lippes lookinglike two little Rubyes, with a commendable smile thus she replyed.

　　Philostratus, gladly I do accept your gift; and to the end that yemay the better remember your selfe, concerning what you have donehitherto: I will and command, that generall preparation be madeagainst to morrow, for faire and happy fortunes hapning to Lovers,after former cruell and unkinde accidents. Which proposition wasvery pleasing to them all.

　　Then calling for the Master of the Houshold, and taking order withhim, what was most needfull to be done; she gave leave unto thewhole company (who were all risen) to go recreate themselves untillsupper time. Some of them walked about the Garden, the beautywhereof banished the least thought of wearinesse. Others walked by theRiver to the Mill, which was not farre off, and the rest fell toexercises, fitting their owne fancies, untill they heard the summonsfor Supper. Hard by the goodly Fountaine (according to their wontedmanner) they supped altogether, and were served to their no meanecontentment: but being risen from the Table, they fell to theirdelight of singing and dancing. While Philomena led the dance, theQueene spake in this manner.

　　Philostratus, I intend not to varie from those courses heretoforeobserved by my predecessors, but even as they have already done, so itis my authority, to command a Song. And because I am well assured,that you are not unfurnished of Songs answerable to the quality of thepassed Novels: my desire is, in regard we would not be troubledhereafter, with any more discourses of unfortunate Love, that youshall sing a Song agreeing with your owne disposition. Philostratusmade answer, that hee was ready to accomplish her command, and withoutall further ceremony, thus he began.

　　THE SONG

　　Chorus. My teares do plainly prove,

　　How justly that poore heart hath cause to greeve

　　Which (under trust) findes Treason in his Love.

　　When first I saw her, that now makes me sigh,

　　Distrust did never enter in my thoughts.

　　So many vertues clearly shin'd in her,

　　That I esteem'd all martyrdome was light

　　Which Love could lay on me. Nor did I greeve,

　　Although I found my liberty was lost.

　　But now mine error I do plainly see:

　　Not without sorrow, thus betray'd to bee.

　　My teares do, etc.

　　For, being left by basest treachery

　　Of her in whom I most reposed trust:

　　I then could see apparant flatterie

　　In all the fairest shewes that she did make.

　　But when I strove to get forth of the snare,

　　I found my selfe the further plunged in.

　　For I beheld another in my place,

　　And I cast off, with manifest disgrace.

　　My, etc.

　　Then felt my heart such hels of heavy woes,

　　Not utterable. I curst the day and houre

　　When first I saw her lovely countenance,

　　Enricht with beautie, farre beyond all other:

　　Which set my soule on fire, enflamde each part,

　　Making a martyrdome of my poore hart.

　　My faith and hope being basely thus betrayde;

　　I durst not moove, to speake I was affrayde.

　　My teares do, etc.

　　Thou canst (thou powerfull God of Love) perceive,

　　My ceasselesse sorrow, voyde of any comfort:

　　I make my moane to thee, and do not fable,

　　Desiring, that to end my misery,

　　Death may come speedily, and with his Dart

　　With one fierce stroke, quite passing through my heart:

　　To cut off future fell contending strife,

　　An happy end be made of Love and Life.

　　My teares do, etc.

　　No other meanes of comfort doth remaine,

　　To ease me of such sharpe afflictions,

　　But onely death. Grant then that I may die,

　　To finish greefe and life in one blest houre.

　　For, being bereft of any future joyes,

　　Come, take me quickly from so false a friend.

　　Yet in my death, let thy great power approve,

　　That I died true, and constant in my Love.

　　My teares do, etc.

　　Happy shall I account this sighing Song,

　　If some (beside my selfe) do learne to sing it,

　　And so consider of my miseries,

　　As may incite them to lament my wrongs.

　　And to be warned by my wretched fate;

　　Least (like my selfe) themselves do sigh too late.

　　Learne Lovers, learne, what tis to be unjust,

　　And be betrayed, where you repose best trust.

　　The words contained in this Song, did manifestly declare, whattorturing afflictions poore Philostratus felt, and more (perhaps)had beene perceived by the lookes of the Lady whom he spake of,being then present in the dance; if the sodaine ensuing darknessehad not hid the crimson blush, which mounted up into her face. But theSong being ended, and divers other beside, lasting till the houre ofrest drew on; by command of the Queene, they all repaired to theirChambers.

　　THE INDUCTION TO THE FIFT DAY

　　WHEREON, ALL THE DISCOURSES DO PASSE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE

　　MOST NOBLE LADY FIAMMETTA: CONCERNING SUCH PERSONS, AS HAVE BENE

　　SUCCESSEFULL IN THEIR LOVE, AFTER MANY HARD AND

　　PERILLOUS MISFORTUNES

　　Now began the Sunne to dart foorth his golden beames, when MadamFiammetta (incited by the sweete singing Birdes, which since thebreake of day, sat merrily chanting on the trees) arose from herbed: as all the other Ladies likewise did, and the three youngGentlemen descending downe into the fields, where they walked in agentle pace on the greene grasse, untill the Sunne were risen a littlehigher. On many pleasant matters they conferred together, as theywalked in severall companies, till at the length the Queene, findingthe heate to enlarge it selfe strongly, returned backe to theCastle; where when they were all arrived, she commanded, that afterthis mornings walking, their stomackes should be refreshed withwholsom Wines, as also divers sorts of banquetting stuffe.Afterward, they all repaired into the Garden, not departing thence,the houre of dinner was come: at which time, the Master of thehoushold, having prepared every thing in decent readinesse, after asolemne song was sung, by order from the Queene, they were seated:

　　When they had dined, to their own liking and contentment, they began(in continuation of their former order) to exercise divers dances, andafterward voyces to their instruments, and many pretty Madrigals andRoundelayes. Upon the finishing of these delights, the Queene gavethem leave to take their rest, when such as were so minded, went tosleep, others solaced themselves in the Garden. But after midday wasoverpast, they met (according to their wonted manner) and as theQueene had commanded, at the faire Fountaine; where she being placedin her seate royall, and casting her eye upon Pamphilus, she bad himbegin the dayes discourses, of happy successe in love, afterdisastrous and troublesome accidents; who yeelding thereto with humblereverence, thus began.

　　Many Novels (gracious Ladies) do offer themselves to my memory,wherewith to beginne so pleasant a day, as it is her Highnessedesire that this should be: among which plenty, I esteeme one aboveall the rest, because you may comprehend thereby, not onely thefortunate conclusion, wherewith we intend to begin our day; butalso, how mighty the forces of Love are, deserving to be bothadmired and reverenced. Albeit there are many, who scarsely knowingwhat they say, do condemne them with infinite grosse imputations:which I purpose to disprove, and (I hope) to your no little pleasing.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　WHEREBY THAT LOVE (OFTENTIMES) MAKETH A MAN BOTH WISE AND

　　VALIANT

　　Chynon, by falling in Love, became wise, and by force of Armes,winning his faire Lady Iphigenia on the Seas, was afterward imprisonedat Rhodes. Being delivered by anyone named Lysimachus, with him herecovered his Iphigenia againe, and faire Cassandra, even in themiddest of their marriage. They fled with them into Candye, whereafter they had married them, they were called home to their ownedwelling.

　　According to the ancient Annales of the Cypriots, there sometimelived in Cyprus, a Noble Gentleman, who was commonly calledAristippus, and exceeded all other of the Country in the goods ofFortune. Divers children he had, but (amongst the rest) a Sonne, inwhose birth he was more infortunate then any of the rest; andcontinually greeved, in regard, that having all the compleateperfections of beauty, good forme, and manly parts, surpassing allother youths of his age or stature, yet hee wanted the reallornament of the soule, reason and judgement; being (indeed a meereIdeot or Foole,) and no better hope to be expected of him. His truename, according as he received it by Baptisme, was Galesus, butbecause neyther by the laborious paines of his Tutors indulgence,and faire endevour of his parents, or ingenuity of any other, he couldnot be brought to civility of life, understanding of Letters, orcommon carriage of a reasonable creature: by his grosse and deformedkinde of speech, his qualities also savouring rather of brutishbreeding, then any way derived from manly education; as an Epithite ofscorne and derision, generally, they gave him the name of Chynon,which in their native Countrey language, and divers other beside,signifieth a very Sot or Foole, and so was he termed by every one.

　　This lost kinde of life in him, was no meane burthen of greefeunto his Noble Father, and all hope being already spent, of any futurehappy recovery, he gave command (because he would not alwaies havesuch a sorrow in his sight) that he should live at a Farme of his ownein a Country Village, among his Peazants and Plough-Swaines. Which wasnot any way distastefull to Chynon, but well agreed with his ownenaturall disposition; for their rurall qualities, and grosse behaviourpleased him beyond the Cities civility. Chynon living thus at hisFathers Countrey Village, exercising nothing else but ruralldemeanour, such as then delighted him above all other: it chanced upona day about the houre of noone, as hee was walking over the fields,with a long staffe on his necke, which commonly he used to carry; heentred in to a small thicket, reputed the goodliest in all thosequarters, and by reason it was then the month of May, the Trees hadtheir leaves fairely shot forth.

　　When he had walked through the thicket, it came to passe, that (evenas good Fortune guided him) hee came into a faire Meadow, on everyside engirt with and in one corner thereof stoode a goodlyFountaine, whose current was both coole and cleare. Hard by it, uponthe greene grasse, he espied a very beautifull young Damosell, seemingto be fast asleepe, attired in such fine loose garments, as hidde verylittle of her white body: onely from the girdle downward, she ware akirtle made close unto her, of interwoven delicate silke; and at herfeete lay two other Damosels sleeping, and a servant in the samemanner. No sooner had Chynon fixed his eye upon her, but he stoodleaning upon his staffe; and viewed her very advisedly, withoutspeaking word, and in no meane admiration, as if he had never seenethe forme of a woman before. He began then to feele in his harshrurall understanding (whereinto never till now, either by painfullinstruction, or all other good meanes used to him, any honest civilityhad power of impression) a strange kinde of humour to awake, whichinformed his grosse and dull spirite, that this Damosell was thevery fairest, which ever any living man beheld.

　　Then he began to distinguish her parts, commending the tresses ofher haire, which he imagined to be of gold; her forehead, nose, mouth,necke, armes, but (above all) her brests, appearing (as yet) but onelyto shew themselves, like two little mountaines. So that, of afielden clownish lout, he would needs now become a Judge of beauty,coveting earnestly in his soule, to see her eyes, which were veiledover with sound sleepe, that kept them fast enclosed together, andonely to looke on them, hee wished a thousand times, that she wouldawake. For, in his judgement, she excelled all the women that everhe had seene, and doubted, whether she were some Goddesse or no; sostrangely was he metamorphosed from folly, to a sensible apprehension,more then common. And so farre did this sodaine knowledge in himextend; that he could conceive of divine and celestiall things, andthat they were more to be admired and reverenced, then those of humaneor terrene consideration; wherefore the more gladly he contentedhimselfe, to tarry till she awaked of her owne accord. And althoughthe time of stay seemed tedious to him, yet notwithstanding, he wasovercome with such extraordinary contentment, as he had no power todepart thence, but stood as if he had bin glued fast to the ground.

　　After some indifferent respite of time, it chanced that the youngDamosel (who was named Iphigenia) awaked before any of the otherwith her, and lifted up her head, with her eyes wide open, she sawChynon standing before her, leaning still on his staffe; whereatmarvailing not a little, she saide unto him: Chynon, whither wanderestthou, or what dost thou seeke for in this wood? Chynon, who notonely by his countenance but likewise his folly, Nobility of birth,and wealthy possessions of his father, was generally knowne throughoutthe Countrey, made no answere at all to the demand of Iphigenia: butso soone as he beheld her eyes open, he began to observe them with aconstant regard, and being perswaded in his soule, that from themflowed such an unutterable singularity, as he had never felt tillthen. Which the young Gentlewoman well noting, she began to waxfearefull, least these stedfast lookes of his, should incite hisrusticity to some attempt, which might redound to her dishonour:wherefore awaking her women and servants, and they all being risen,she saide. Farewell Chynon, I leave thee to thine owne good Fortune;whereto hee presently replyed, saying: I will go with you. Now,although the Gentlewoman refused his company, as dreading some acte ofincivility from him: yet could she not devise any way to be rid ofhim, till he had brought her to her owne dwelling, where takingleave mannerly of her, he went directly home to his Fathers house,saying: Nothing should compell him to live any longer in the muddyCountry. And albeit his Father was much offended hereat, and all therest of his kindred and friends: (yet not knowing how to helpe it)they suffered him to continue there still, expecting the cause of thishis so sodaine alteration, from the course of life, which contentedhim so highly before.

　　Chynon being now wounded to the heart (where never any civillinstruction could before get entrance) with loves piercing dart, bythe bright beauty of Iphigenia, mooved much admiration (falling fromone change to another) in his Father, Kindred, and all else thatknew him. For first, he requested of his Father, that he might behabited and respected like to his other Brethren, whereto right gladlyhe condiscended. And frequenting the company of civill youths,observing also the cariage of Gentlemen, especially such as wereamorously enclined: he grew to a beginning in short time (to thewonder of every one) not onely to understand the first instructionof letters, but also became most skilfull, even amongst them that werebest exercised in Philosophy. And afterward, love to Iphigenia beingthe sole occasion of this happy alteration, not onely did his harshand clownish voyce convert it selfe more mildely, but also heebecame a singular Musitian, and could perfectly play on anyinstrument. Beside, he tooke delight in the riding and managing ofgreat horses, and finding himselfe of a strong and able body, heexercised all kinds of Military Disciplines, as well by Sea, as on theland. And, to be breefe, because I would not seeme tedious in therepetition of all his vertues, scarsly had he attained to the fourthyeare, after he was thus falne in love, but hee became generallyknowne, to be the most civil, wise, and worthy Gentleman, aswell forall vertues enriching the minde, as any whatsoever to beautifie thebody, that very hardly he could be equalled throughout the wholekingdome of Cyprus.What shall we say then (vertuous Ladies) concerning this Chynon?Surely nothing else, but that those high and divine vertues, infusedinto his gentle soule, were by envious Fortune bound and shut up insome small angle of his intellect, which being shaken and set atliberty by love, (as having a farre more potent power then Fortune, inquickning and reviving the dull drowsie spirits) declared his mightyand soveraigne Authority, in setting free so many faire and preciousvertues unjustly detayned, to let the worlds eye behold them truly, bymanifest testimony from whence he can deliver those spiritssubjected to his power, and guid them (afterward) to the highestdegrees of honour. And although Chynon by affecting Iphigenia,failed in some particular things; yet notwithstanding, his FatherAristippus duely considering, that love had made him a man, whereas(before) he was no better then a beast: not onely endured allpatiently, but also advised him therein, to take such courses asbest liked himselfe. Neverthelesse, Chynon (who refused to be calledGalesus, which was his naturall name indeed) remembring that Iphigeniatearmed him Chynon, and coveting (under this title) to accomplishthe issue of his honest amorous desire: made many motions toCiphaeus the Father of Iphigenia, that he would be pleased to lethim enjoy her in marriage. But Ciphaeus told him, that he hadalready passed his promise for her, to a Gentleman of Rhodes, namedPasimondo, which promise he religiously intended to performe.

　　The time being come, which was concluded on for Iphigeniaesmarriage, in regard that the affianced husband had sent for her:Chynon thus communed with his owne thoughts. Now is the time (quothhe) to let my divine Mistresse see, how truly and honourably I doeaffect her, because (by her) I am become a man. But if I could bepossessed of her, I should growe more glorious, then the commoncondition of a mortall man, and have her I will, or loose my life inthe adventure. Being thus resolved, he prevailed with divers youngGentlemen his friends, making them of his faction, and secretlyprepared a Shippe, furnished with all things for a Naval fight,setting sodainly forth to Sea, and hulling abroad in those parts bywhich the vessell should passe, that must convey Iphigenia to Rhodesto her husband. After many honours done to them, who were to transporther thence unto Rhodes, being imbarked, they set saile upon theirBon viaggio.

　　Chynon, who slept not in a businesse so earnestly importing him, seton them (the day following) with his Ship, and standing aloft on thedecke, cryed out to them that had the charge of Iphigenia, saying.Strike your sayles, or else determine to be sunke in the Sea. Theenemies to Chynon, being nothing danted with his words, prepared tostand upon their owne defence; which made Chynon, after the formerspeeches delivered, and no answer returned, to command the graplingIrons to be cast forth, which tooke such fast hold on the Rhodiansshippe, that (whether they would or no) both the vessels joynedclose together. And he shewing himselfe fierce like a Lyon, nottarrying to be seconded by any, stepped aboord the Rhodians ship, asif he made no respect at all of them, and having his sword readydrawne in his hand (incited by the vertue of unfaigned love) laiedabout him on all sides very manfully. Which when the men of Rhodesperceived, casting downe their weapons, and all of them (as it were)with one voyce, yeelded themselves his prisoners: whereupon he said.

　　Honest Friends, neither desire of booty, nor hatred to you, didoccasion my departure from Cyprus, thus to assaile you with drawneweapons: but that which hereto hath most mooved me, is a matter highlyimporting to me, and very easie for you to grant, and so enjoy yourpresent peace. I desire to have faire Iphigenia from you, whom Ilove above all other Ladies living, because I could not obtaine her ofher father, to make her my lawfull wife in marriage. Love is theground of my instant Conquest, and I must use you as my mortallenemies, if you stand upon any further tearmes with me, and do notdeliver her as mine owne: for your Pasimondo, must not enjoy what ismy right, first by vertue of my love, and now by Conquest: Deliver hertherefore, and depart hence at your pleasure.

　　The men of Rhodes, being rather constrained thereto, then of anyfree disposition in themselves, with teares in their eyes, deliveredIphigenia to Chynon; who beholding her in like manner to weepe, thusspake unto her. Noble Lady, do not any way discomfort your selfe,for I am your Chynon, who have more right and true title to you, andmuch better doe deserve to enjoy you, by my long continued affectionto you, then Pasimondo can any way plead; because you belong to himbut onely by promise. So, bringing her aboord his owne ship, where theGentlemen his companions gave her kinde welcome, without touchingany thing else belonging to the Rhodians, he gave them free liberty todepart.

　　Chynon being more joyfull, by the obtaining of his hearts desire,then any other conquest else in the world could make him, after he hadspent some time in comforting Iphigenia, who as yet sate sadlysighing; he consulted with his companions, who joyned with him inopinion, that their safest course was, by no meanes to returne toCyprus; and therefore all (with one consent) resolved to set saile forCandye, where every one made account, but especially Chynon, in regardof ancient and new combined Kindred, as also very intimate friends, tofinde very worthy entertainement, and so to continue there safely withIphigenia. But Fortune, who was so favourable to Chynon, in grantinghim so pleasing a Conquest, to shew her constancy, so sodainly changedthe inestimable joy of our jocond Lover, into as heavy sorrow anddisaster. For, foure houres were not fully compleated, since hisdeparture from the Rhodians, but darke night came upon them, and hesitting conversing with his faire Mistresse, in the sweetest solace ofhis soule; the winds began to blow roughly, the Seas swelledangerly, and a tempest arose impetuously, that no man could see whathis duty was to do, in such a great unexpected distresse, nor how towarrant themselves from perishing.

　　If this accident were displeasing to poore Chynon, I thinke thequestion were in vaine demanded: for now it seemeth to him, that theGodds had granted his cheefe desire, to the end he should dye with thegreater anguish, in losing both his love and life together. Hisfriends likewise, felte the selfesame affliction, but especiallyIphigenia, who wept and greeved beyond all measure, to see the shipbeaten with such stormy billowes, as threatned her sinking everyminute. Impatiently she cursed the love of Chynon, greatly blaming hisdesperate boldnesse, and maintaining, that so violent a tempestcould never happen, but onely by the Gods displeasure, who would notpermit him to have a wife against their will; and therefore thuspunished his proud presumption, not onely in his unavoidable death,but also that her life must perish for company.

　　She continuing in these wofull lamentations, and the Marinerslabouring all in vaine, because the violence of the tempestencreased more and more, so that every moment they expectedwracking: they were carried (contrary to their owne knowledge) veryneere unto the Isle of Rhodes, which they being no way able toavoyd, and utterly ignorant of the Coast; for safety of their lives,they laboured to land there if possibly they might. Wherein Fortunewas somewhat furtherous to them, driving them into a small gulfe ofthe Sea, whereinto (but a little while before) the Rhodians, from whomChynon had taken Iphigenia, were newly entred with their ship. Nor hadthey any knowledge each of other, till the breake of day (which madethe heavens to looke more clearly) gave them discovery of being withina flight shoote together. Chynon looking forth, and espying the sameship which he had left the day before, hee grew exceedingsorrowfull, as fearing that which after followed, and therefore heewilled the Mariners, to get away from her by all their best endeavour,and let fortune afterward dispose of them as she pleased; for into aworse place they could not come, nor fall into the like danger.

　　The Mariners employed their very utmost paines, and all proved butlosse of time: for the winde was so sterne, and the waves soturbulent, that still they drove them the contrary way: so thatstriving to get forth of the gulfe, whether they would or no, theywere driven on land, and instantly knowne to the Rhodians, whereofthey were not a little joyfull. The men of Rhodes being landed, ranpresently to the neere-neighbouring Villages, where dwelt diversworthy Gentlemen, to whom they reported the arrivall of Chynon, whatfortune befell them at Sea, and that Iphigenia might now berecovered againe with chastisement to Chynon for his bold insolence.They being very joyfull of these good newes, took so many men asthey could of the same Village, and ran immediately to the Sea side,where Chynon being newly Landed and his people, intending flightinto a neere adjoyning Forrest, for defence of himselfe and Iphigenia,they were all taken, led thence to the Village, and afterwards tothe chiefe City of Rhodes.

　　No sooner were they arrived, but Pasimondo, the intended Husband forIphigenia (who had already heard the tydings) went and complained tothe Senate, who appointed a Gentleman of Rhodes named Lysimachus,and being that yeere soveraigne Magistrate over the Rhodians, to gowell provided for the apprehension of Chynon and his company,committing them to prison, which accordingly was done. In this manner,the poore unfortunate lover Chynon, lost his faire Iphigenia, havingwon her in so short a while before, and scarsely requited with so muchas a kisse. But as for Iphigenia, she was royally welcommed by manyLords and Ladies of Rhodes, who so kindely comforted her, that shesoone forgotte all her greefe and trouble on the Sea, remaining incompany of those Ladies and Gentlewomen, untill the day determined forher marriage.

　　At the earnest entreaty of divers Rhodian Gentlemen, who were in theShip with Iphigenia, and had their lives courteously saved byChynon: both he and his friends had their lives likewise spared,although Pasimondo laboured importunately, to have them all put todeath; onely they were condemned to perpetuall imprisonment, which(you must thinke) was most greevous to them, as being now hopelesse ofany deliverance. But in the meane time, while Pasimondo was orderinghis nuptiall preparation, Fortune seeming to repent the wrongs she haddone to Chynon, prepared a new accident, whereby to comfort him inthis deepe distresse, and in such manner as I will relate unto you.

　　Pasimondo had a Brother, yonger then he in yeeres, but not a jotinferiour to him in vertue, whose name was Hormisda, and long time thecase had bene in question, for his taking to wife a faire youngGentlewoman of Rhodes, called Cassandra; whom Lysimachus the Governourloved very dearly, and hindred her marriage with Hormisda, by diversstrange accidents. Now Pasimondo perceiving, that his owne Nuptialsrequired much cost and solemnity, hee thought it very convenient, thatone day might serve for both their Weddings, which else would lanchinto more lavish expences, and therefore concluded, that his brotherHormisda should marry Cassandra, at the same time as he weddedIphigenia. Hereupon, he consulted with the Gentlewomans parents, wholiking the motion as well as he, the determination was set downe,and one day to effect the duties of both.

　　When this came to the hearing of Lysimachus, it was very greatlydispleasing to him, because now he saw himselfe utterly deprived of alhope to attaine the issue of his desire, if Hormisda receivedCassandra in marriage. Yet being a very wise and worthy man, hedissembled his distaste, and began to consider on some apt meanes,whereby to disappoint the marriage once more, which he foundimpossible to be done, except it were by way of rape or stealth. Andthat did not appeare to him any difficult matter, in regard of hisOffice and Authority: onely it would seeme dishonest in him, by givingsuch an unfitting example. Neverthelesse, after long deliberation,honour gave way to love, and resolutely he concluded to steale heraway, whatsoever became of it.

　　Nothing wanted now, but a convenient company to assist him, andthe order how to have it done. Then he remembred Chynon and hisfriends, whom he detained as his prisoners, and perswaded himselfe,that he could not have a more faithfull friend in such a busines, thenChynon was. Hereupon, the night following, he sent for him into hisChamber, and being alone by themselves, thus he began. Chynon (quothhe) as the Gods are very bountifull, in bestowing their blessings onmen, so do they therein most wisely make proofe of their vertues,and such as they finde firme and constant, in all occurrences whichmay happen, then they make worthy (as valiant spirits) of t verybest and highest merites. Now, they being willing to have more certainexperience of thy vertues, then those which heretofore thou hastshewne, within the bounds and limits of thy fathers possessions, whichI know to be superabounding: perhaps do intend to present thee otheroccasions, of more important weight and consequence.

　　For first of all (as I have heard) by the piercing solicitudes oflove, of a senselesse creature, that made thee to become a manendued with reason. Afterward, by adverse fortune, and now againe bywearisome imprisonment, it seemeth that they are desirous to maketryall, whether thy manly courage be changed, or no, from that whichheretofore it was, when thou enjoyedst a matchlesse beauty, and losther againe in so short a while. Wherefore, if thy vertue be such as ithath bin, the Gods can never give thee any blessing more worthyacceptance, then she whom they are now minded to bestow on thee: inwhich respect, to the end that thou mayst re-assume thy wantedheroicke spirit, and become more couragious than ever heretofore, Iwill acquaint thee withall more at large.

　　Understand then Noble Chynon, that Pasimondo, the onely glad manof thy misfortune, and diligent sutor after thy death, maketh all hasthee can possibly devise to do, to celebrate his marriage with thyfaire Mistresse: because he would plead possession of the prey,which Fortune (when she smiled) did first bestow, and (afterwardfrowning) tooke from thee againe. Now, that it must needs be veryirkesome to thee (at least if thy love bee such, as I am perswadedit is) I partly can collect from my selfe, being intended to bewronged by his brother Hormisda, even in the selfesame maner, and onhis marriage day, by taking faire Cassandra from me, the onelyJewell of my love and life. For the prevention of two such notoriousinjuries, I see that Fortune hath left us no other meanes, but onelythe vertue of our courages, and the helpe of our right hands, bypreparing our selves to Armes, opening a way to thee, by a second rapeor stealth; and to me the first, for absolute possession of our divineMistresses. Wherefore, if thou art desirous to recover thy losse, Iwill not onely pronounce liberty to thee (which I thinke thou dostlittle care for without her) but dare also assure thee to enjoyIphigenia, so thou wilt assist me in mine enterprize, and follow me inmy fortune, if the Gods do let them fall into our power.

　　You may well imagine, that Chynons dismayed soule was not a littlecheared at these speeches; and therefore, without craving any longrespit of time for answer, thus he replyed. Lord Lysimachus, in such abusines as this is, you cannot have a faster friend then my selfe,at least, if such good hap may betide me, as you have more thenhalfe promised: and therefore do no more but command what you wouldhave to be effected by mee, and make no doubt of my courage in theexecution: whereon Lysimachus made this answer. Know then Chynon(quoth he) that three dayes hence, these marriages are to beecelebrated in the houses of Pasimondo and Hormisda: upon which day,thou, thy friends, and my selfe (with some others, in whom I reposeespeciall trust) by the friendly favour of night, will enter intotheir houses, while they are in the middest of their joviall feasting;and (seizing on the two Brides) beare them thence to a Shippe, which Iwill have lye in secret, waiting for our comming, and kill all such asshall presume to impeach us. This direction gave great contentmentto Chynon, who remained still in prison, without revealing a word tohis owne friends, untill the limited time was come.

　　Upon day, performed with great and magnificent Triumph, there wasnot a corner in the Brethrens houses, but it sung joy in the highestkey. Lysimachus, after he had ordred all things as they ought to be,and the houre for dispat approached neere; hee made a division inthree parts, of Chynon, his followers, and his owne friends, being allwell armed under their outward habites. Having first used someencouraging speeches, for more resolute prosecution of the enterprize,hee sent troope secretly to the Port, that they might not beehindred of going aboord the ship, when the urgent necessity shouldrequire it. Passing with the other two traines of Pasimondo, he leftthe one at the doore, that such as were in the house, might not shutthem up fast, and so impeach their passage forth. Then with Chynon,and the third band of Confederates, he ascended the staires up intothe Hall, where he found the Brides with store of Ladies andGentlewomen, all sitting in comely order at Supper. Rushing in roughlyamong the attendants, downe they threw the Tables, and each of themlaying hold of his Mistris, delivered them into the hands of theirfollowers, commanding that they should bee carried aboord the ship,for avoiding of further inconveniences.

　　This hurrie and amazement being in the house, the Brides weeping,the Ladies lamenting, and all the servants confusedly wondering;Chynon and Lysimachus (with their Friends) having their weaponsdrawn in their hands, made all opposers to give them way, and sogayned the stair head for their owne descending. There stoodPasimonda, with an huge long Staffe in his hand, to hinder theirpassage downe the stayres; but Chynon saluted him so soundly on thehead, that it being cleft in twaine, he fell dead before his feete.His Brother Hormisda came to his rescue, and sped in the selfe-samemanner as he had done; so did divers other beside, whom the companionsto Lysimachus and Chynon, either slew out-right, or wounded.

　　So they left the house, filled with blood, teares, and outcries,going on together, without any hinderance, and so brought both theBrides aboord the ship, which they rowed away instantly with theirOares. For, now the shore was full of armed people, who came in rescueof the stolne Ladies: but all in vaine, because they were lanched intothe main, and sayled on merrily towards Candye. Where being arrived,they were worthily entertained by honourable Friends and Kinsmen,who pacified all unkindnesses betweene them and their Mistresses: And,having accepted them in lawfull marriage, there they lived in no meanejoy and contentment: albeit there was a long and troublesomedifference (about these rapes) betweene Rhodes and Cyprus.

　　But yet in the end, by the meanes of Noble Friends and Kindred oneither side, labouring to have such discontentment appeased,endangering warre betweene the Kingdomes: after a limited time ofbanishment, Chynon returned joyfully with his Iphigenia home toCyprus, and Lysimachus with his beloved Cassandra unto Rhodes, eachliving in their severall Countries, with much felicity.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THE FIRME LOYALTIE OF A TRUE LOVER: AND HOW

　　FORTUNE DOTH SOMETIME HUMBLE MEN, TO RAISE THEM

　　AFTERWARD TO A FARRE HIGHER DEGREE

　　Faire Constance of Liparis, fell in love with Martuccio Gomito:and hearing that he was dead, desperately she entred into a Barke,which being transported by the windes to Susa in Barbary, fromthence she went to Thunis, where she found him to be living. There shemade her selfe knowne to him, and he being in great authority, as aprivy Counsellor to the King: he married the saide Constance, andreturned richly home with Air, to the Island of Liparis.

　　When the Queene perceived, that the Novell recited by Pamphiluswas concluded, which she graced with especiall commendations: sheecommanded Madam Aemilia, to take her turne as next in order; whereuponshe thus began. Me thinkes it is a matter of equity, that every oneshould take delight in those things, whereby the recompence may benoted, answerable to their one affection. And because I ratherdesire to walke along by the paths of pleasure, then dwell on anyceremonious or scrupulous affectation, I shall the more gladly obeyour Queene to day, then yesterday I did our melancholly King.

　　Understand then (Noble Ladies) that neere to Sicily, there is asmall Island, commonly called Liparis, wherein (not long since)lived a yong Damosell, named Constance, born of very sufficientparentage in the same Island. There dwelt also a yong man calledMartuccio Gomito, of comely feature, well conditioned, and notunexpert in many vertuous qualities; affecting Constance in hartymanner: and she so answerable to him in the same kinde, that to bein his company, was her onely felicity. Martuccio coveting to enjoyher in marriage, made his intent knowne to her Father: whoupbraiding him with poverty, tolde him plainly that he should not haveher. Martuccio greeving to see himselfe thus despised, because hewas poore: made such good meanes, that he was provided of a smallBarke; and calling such friends (as he thought fit) to hisassociation, made a solemne vow, that he would never returne backeto Liparis, untill he was rich, and in better condition.

　　In the nature and course of a Rover or Pirate, so put thence to sea,coasting all about Barbarie, robbing and spoyling such as he met with;who were of no greater strength then himselfe: wherein Fortune wasso favourable to him, that he became wealthy in a very short while.But as felicities are not alwayes permanent, so he and hisfollowers, not contenting themselves with sufficient riches: by greedyseeking to get more, happened to be taken by certaine ships of theSarazins, and so were robbed themselves of all that they had gotten,yet they resisted them stoutly a long while together, though it provedto the losse of many lives among them. When the Sarazens had sunke hisship in the Sea, they tooke him with them to Thunis, where he wasimprisoned, and lived in extreamest misery.

　　Newes came to Liparis, not onely by one, but many more beside,that all those which departed thence in the small Barke withMartuccio, were drowned in the Sea, and not a man escaped. WhenConstance, heard these unwelcome tydings (who was exceeding full ofgreefe, for his so desperate departure) she wept and lamentedextraordinarily, desiring now rather to dye, then live any longer. Yetshe had not the heart, to lay any violent hand on her selfe, butrather to end her dayes by some new kinde of necessity. Anddeparting privately from her Fathers house, she went to the Port orHaven, where (by chance) she found a small Fisher-boate, lying distantfrom the other vessels, the owners whereof being all gone on shore,and it well furnished with Masts, Sailes, and Oares, she entred intoit; and putting forth the Oares, being somewhat skilfull in sayling,(as generally all the Women of that Island are) she so well guided theSailes, Rudder, and Oares, that she was quickly farre off from theLand, and soly remained at the mercy of the windes. For thus she hadresolved with her selfe, that the Boat being uncharged, and withouta guide, would either be overwhelmed by the windes, or split in peecesagainst some Rocke; by which meanes she could [not] escape althoughshe would, but (as it was her desire) must needs be drowned.

　　In this determination, wrapping a mantle about her head, and lyingdowne weeping in the boats bottome, she hourely expected her finallexpiration: but it fell out otherwise, and contrary to her desperateintention, because the wind turning to the North, and blowing verygently, without disturbing the Seas a jot, they conducted the smallBoat in such sort, that after the night of her entering into it, andthe morrowes sailing untill the evening, it came within an hundreleagues of Thunis and to a strond neere a Towne called Susa. The youngDamosell knew not whether she were on the sea or land; as one, who notby any accident hapning, lifted up her head to looke about her,neither intended ever to doe. Now it came to passe, that as theboate was driven to the shore, a poore woman stood at the Sea side,washing certaine Fishermens Nets; and seeing the boate comming towardsher under saile, without any person appearing in it, she wondredthereat not a little. It being close at the shore, and she thinkingthe Fishermen to be asleepe therein: stept boldly, and looked into theboate, where she saw not any body, but onely the poore distressedDamosell, whose sorrowes having brought her now into a sound sleepe,the woman gave many cals before she could awake her, which at thelength she did, and looked very strangely about her.

　　The poore woman perceyving by her habite that she was a Christian,demanded of her (in speaking Latine) how it was possible for her,being all alone in the boate, to arrive there in this manner? WhenConstance, heard her speake the Latine tongue, she began to doubt,least some contrary winde had turned her backe to Liparis againe,and starting up sodainly, to looke with better advice about her,shee saw her selfe at Land: and not knowing the Countrey, demandedof the poore woman where she was? Daughter (quoth she) you are heerehard by Susa in Barbarie. Which Constance hearing, and plainlyperceyving, that death had denied to end her miseries, fearing leastshe should receive some dishonour, in such a barbarous unkindeCountry, and not knowing what should now become of her, shee satedowne by the boates side, wringing her hands, and weeping bitterly.

　　The good Woman did greatly compassionate her case, and prevailedso well by gentle speeches, that she conducted her into her owne poorehabitation, where at length she understoode, by what meanes sheehapned thither so strangely. And perceyving her to be fasting, she setsuch homely bread as she had before her, a few small Fishes, and aCrewse of Water, praying her for to accept of that pooreentertainment, which meere necessity compelled her to do, and shewedher selfe very thankefull for it.

　　Constance hearing that she spake the Latine language so well;desired to know what she was. Whereto the old woman thus answered:Gentlewoman (quoth she) I am of Trapanum, named Carapresa, and am aservant in this Countrey to certaine Christian Fishermen. The youngMaiden (albeit she was very full of sorrow) hearing her name to beCarapresa, conceived it as a good augury to her selfe, and that shehad heard the name before, although she knew not what occasionshould move her thus to do. Now began her hopes to quicken againe, andyet she could not relie upon what ground; nor was she so desirous ofdeath as before, but made more precious estimation of her life, andwithout any further declaration of her selfe or Countrey, sheentreated the good woman (even for charities sake) to take pitty onher youth, and helpe her with such good advice, to prevent allinjuries which might happen to her, in such a solitary wofullcondition.

　　Carapresa having heard her request, like a good woman as she was,left Constance in her poore Cottage, and went hastily to leave hernets in safety: which being done, she returned backe againe, andcovering Constance with her Mantle, led her on to Susa with her, wherebeing arrived, the good woman began in this manner. Constance, Iwill bring thee to the house of a very worthy Sarazin Lady, to whomI have done many honest services, according as she pleased tocommand me. She is an ancient woman, full of charity, and to her Iwill commend thee as best I may, for I am well assured, that shewill gladly entertaine thee, and use thee as if thou wert her owndaughter. Now, let it be thy part, during thy time of remaining withher, to employ thy utmost diligence in pleasing her, by deservingand gaining her grace, till heaven shall blesse thee with betterfortune: and as she promised, so she performed.

　　The Sarazine Lady, being well stept into yeares, upon thecommendable speeches delivered by Carapresa, did the more seriouslyfasten her eye on Constance, and compassion provoking her to teares,she tooke her by the hand, and (in loving manner) kissed herfore-head. So she led her further into her house, where dwelt diversother women (but not one man) all exercising themselves in severalllabours, as working in all sorts of silke, with Imbroideries of Goldand Silver, and sundry other excellent Arts beside, which in shorttime were very familiar to Constance, and so pleasing grew herbehaviour to the old Lady, and all the rest beside; that they lovedand delighted in her wonderfully, and (by little and little) sheattained to the speaking of their language, although it were veryharsh and difficult.

　　Constance continuing thus in the old Ladies service at Susa, andthought to be dead or lost in her owne Fathers house; it fortuned,that one reigning then as King of Thunis, who named himselfeMariabdela: there was a young Lord of great birth, and very powerfull,who lived as then in Granada, and pleaded that the Kingdome ofThunis belonged to him. In which respect, he mustred together a mightyArmy, and came to assault the King, as hoping to expell him. Thesenewes comming to the eare of Martuccio Gomito, who spake the BarbarianLanguage perfectly; and hearing it reported, that the King of Thunismade no meane preparation for his owne defence: he conferred withone of his keepers, who had the custody of him, and the rest takenwith him, saying: If (quoth he) I could have meanes to speake with theKing, and he were pleased to allow of my counsell, I can enstructhim in such a course, as shall assure him to win the honor of thefield. The Guard reported these speeches to his Master, whopresently acquainted the King therewith, and Martuccio being sent for;he was commanded to speake his minde: Whereupon he began in thismanner.

　　My gracious Lord, during the time that I have frequented yourcountrey, I have heedfully observed, that the Militarie Disciplineused in your fights and battailes, dependeth more upon your Archers,then any other men imployed in your war And therefore, if it couldbe so ordered, that this kinde of Artillery may faile in yourenemies Campe, and yours be sufficiently furnished therewith, youneede make no doubt of winning the battaile: whereto the King thusreplyed. Doubtlesse, if such an act were possible to be done, it wouldgive great hope of successefull prevalling. Sir, said Martuccio, ifyou please it may be done, and I can quickly resolve you how. Letthe strings of your Archers Bowes be made more soft and gentle, thenthose which heretofore they have formerly used; and next, let thenockes of the Arrowes be so provided, as not to receive any other,then those pliant gentle strings. But this must be done so secretly,that your enemies may have no knowledge thereof, least they shouldprovide themselves in the same manner. Now the reason (GraciousLord) why thus I counsell you, is to this end. When the Archers on theEnemies side have shot their Arrowes at your men, and yours in thelike maner at them: it followeth, that (upon meere constraint) theymust gather up your Arrowes, to shoote them backe againe at you, forso long while as the battell endureth, as no doubt but your men wil dothe like to them. But your enemies finde themselves much deceived,because they can make no use of your peoples Arrowes, in regard thatthe nockes are too narrow to receive their boystrous strings. Whichwill fall out contrary with your followers, for the pliant stringsbelonging to your Bowes, are as apt for their enemies great nocktArrowes, as their owne, and so they shall have free use of both,reserving them in plentifull store, when your adversaries must standunfurnished of any, but them that they cannot any way use.

　　This counsell pleased the King very highly, and he being a Prince ofgreat understanding, gave order to have it accordingly followed, andthereby valiantly vanquished his enemies. Heereupon, Martuccio came tobe great in his grace, as also consequently rich, and seated in nomeane place of authority. Now as worthy and commendable actions aresoone spread abroad, in honor of the man by whom they hapned: evenso the fame of this rare got victory, was quickly noysed throughoutthe Countrey, and came to the hearing of poore Constance, thatMartuccio Gomito (whom she supposed so long since to be dead) wasliving, and in honourable condition. The love which formerly shebare unto him, being not altogether extinct in her heart; of a smallsparke, brake forth into a sodaine flame, and so encreased day by day,that her hope (being before almost quite dead) revived againe inchearfull manner.

　　Having imparted all her fortunes to the good old Lady with whomshe dwelt; she told her beside, that she had an earnest desire tosee Thunis, to satisfie her eyes as well as her eares, concerningthe rumor blazed abroad. The good old Lady commended her desire, and(even as if she had bene her Mother) tooke her with her aboord aBarke, and so sayled thence to Thunis, where both she and Constancefound honourable welcome, in the house of a kinsman to the SarazinLady. Carapresa also went along with them thither, and her they sentabroad into the City, to understand the newes of Martuccio Gomito.After they knew for a certainty that he was living, and in greatauthority about the King, according as the former report went ofhim. Then the good old Lady, being desirous to let Martuccio know,that his faire friend Constance was come thither to see him; wenther selfe to the place of his abiding, and spake unto him in thismanner. Noble Martuccio, there is a servant of thine in my house,which came from Liparis, and requireth to have a little privateconference with thee: but because I durst not trust any other with themessage, my selfe (at her entreaty) am come to acquaint theetherewith. Martuccio gave her kinde and hearty thankes, and thenwent along with her to the house.

　　No sooner did Constance behold him, but she was ready to dye withconceite of joy, and being unable to containe her passion: sodainelyshe threw her armes about his necke, and in meere compassion of hermany misfortunes, as also the instant solace of her soule (not beingable to utter one word) the teares trickled abundantly downe hercheekes. Martuccio also seeing his faire friend, was overcome withexceeding admiration, and stood awhile, as not knowing what to say;till venting forth a vehement sighe, thus he spake. My deerest loveConstance! Art thou yet living? It is a tedious long while since Iheard thou wast lost, and never any tydings knowne of thee in thineowne Fathers house. With which words, the teares standing in his eyes,most lovingly he embraced her, Constance recounted to him all herfortunes, and what kindnesse she had receyved from the SarazineLady, since her first houre of comming to her. And after much otherdiscourse passing betweene them, Martuccio departed from her, andreturning to the King his master, tolde him all the history of hisfortunes, and those beside of his Love Constance, being purposelyminded (with his gracious liking) to marry her according to theChristian Law.

　　The King was much amazed at so many strange accidents, and sendingfor Constance to come before him; from her owne mouth he heard thewhole relation of her continued affection to Martuccio, whereuponhee saide. Now trust me faire Damosell, thou hast dearely deserved himto be thy husband. Then sending for very costly Jewels, and richpresents, the one halfe of them he gave to her, and the other toMartuccio, graunting them license withall, to marry according to theirowne mindes.

　　Martuccio did many honors, and gave great gifts to the aged SarazineLady, with whom Constance had lived so kindly respected: whichalthough she had no neede of, neither ever expected any suchrewarding; yet (conquered by their urgent importunity, especiallyConstance, who could not be thankfull enough to her) she wasenforced to receive them, and taking her leave of them weeping, sayledbacke againe to Susa.

　　Within a short while after, the King licensing their departurethence, they entred into a small Barke, and Carapresa with them,sailing on with prosperous gales of winde, untill they arrived atLiparis, where they were entertained with generall rejoycing. Andbecause their marriage was not sufficiently performed at Thunis, inregard of divers Christian ceremonies there wanting, their Nuptialswere againe most honourably solemnized, and they lived (many yearesafter) in health and much happinesse.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　WHEREIN, THE SEVERALL POWERS BOTH OF LOVE AND FORTUNE, IS

　　MORE AT LARGE APPROVED

　　Pedro Bocamazzo, escaping away with a yong Damosell which heloved, named Angelina, met with Theeves in his journey. The Damosellflying fearfully into a Forrest, by chance arriveth at a Castle. Pedrobeing taken by the Theeves, and happening afterward to escape fromthem; commeth (accidentally) to the same Castle where Angelina was.And marrying her, they then returned home to Rome.

　　There was not any one in the whole company, but much commended theNovell reported by Madam Aemilia, and when the Queene perceived it wasended, she turned towards Madam Eliza, commanding her to continue ontheir delightfull exercise: whereto she declaring her willingobedience, began to speake thus. Courteous Ladies, I remember oneunfortunate night, which happened to two Lovers, that were notindued with the greatest discretion. But because they had very manyfaire and happy dayes afterwards, I am the more willing for to let youheare it.

　　In the City of Rome, which (in times past) was called the Lady andMistresse of the world, though now scarsely so good as the waiting,maid: there dwelt sometime yong Gentleman, named Pedro Boccamazzo,descended from one of the most honorable families in Rome, who wasmuch enamoured of a beautifull Gentlewoman, called Angelina,Daughter to one named Gigliuozzo Saullo, whose fortunes were none ofthe fairest, yet he greatly esteemed among the Romanes. Theentercourse of love betweene these twaine, had so equally enstructedtheir hearts and soule, that it could hardly be judged which of themwas the more fervent in affection. But he, not being inured to suchoppressing passions, and therefore the lesse able to support them,except he were sure to compasse his desire, plainly made the motion,that he might enjoy her in honourable mariage. Which his parents andfriends hearing, they went to conferre with him, blaming him withover-much basenesse, so farre to disgrace himselfe and his stocke.Beside, they advised the Father to the Maid, neither to credit whatPedro saide in this case, or to live in hope of any such match,because they all did wholly despise it.

　　Pedro perceiving, that the way was shut up, whereby (and none other)he was to mount the Ladder of his hopes; began to wax weary oflonger living: and if he could have won her fathers consent, hewould have maried her in the despight of all his friends.Neverthelesse, he had a conceit hammering in his head, which if themaid would bee as forward as himselfe, should bring the matter to fulleffect. Letters and secret intelligences passing still betweene, atlength he understood her ready resolution, to adventure with himthorough all fortunes whatsoever, concluding on their sodaine andsecret flight from Rome. For which Pedro did so well provide, thatvery early in a morning, and well mounted on horsebacke, they tookethe way leading unto Alagna, where Pedro had some honest friends, inwhom he reposed especiall trust. Riding on thus thorow the countrey,having no leysure to accomplish their marriage, because they stoodin feare of pursuite: they were ridden above foure leagues fromRome, still shortning the way with their amorous discoursing.

　　It fortuned, that Pedro having no certaine knowledge of the way, butfollowing a trackt guiding too farre on the left hand; rode quiteout of course, and came at last within sight of a small Castle, out ofwhich (before they were aware) yssued twelve Villaines, whomAngelina sooner espyed, then Pedro could do; which made her cry out tohim, saying: Helpe deere Love to save us, or else we shall beassayled. Pedro then turning his horse so expeditiously as he could,and giving him the spurres as need required; mainly he galloppedinto a neere adjoyning Forrest, more minding the following ofAngelina, then any direction of way, or them that endeavoured to beehis hindrance. So that by often winding and turning about, as thepassage appeared troublesome to him, when he thought him selfe freeand furthest from them, he was round engirt, and seized on by them.When they had made him to dismount from his horse, questioning himof whence and what he was, and he resolving them therein, they fellinto a secret consultation, saying thus among themselves. This manis a friend to our deadly enemies, how can wee then otherwisedispose of him, but dreame him of all he hath, and in despight ofthe Orsini (men in nature hatefull to us) hang him up heere on oneof these Trees?

　　All of them agreeing in this dismall resolution, they commandedPedro to put off his garments, which he yeelding to do (albeitunwillingly) it so fell out, that five and twenty other theeves,came sodainly rushing in upon them, crying, Kill, kill, and sparenot a man.

　　They which before had surprized Pedro, desiring now to shift fortheir owne safetie, left him standing quaking in his shirt, and soranne away mainely to defend themselves. Which the new crewperceyving, and that their number farre exceeded the other: theyfollowed to robbe them of what they had gotten, accounting it as apresent purchase for them. Which when Pedro perceyved, and saw nonetarrying to prey uppon him; hee put on his cloathes againe, andmounting on his owne Horse, gallopped that way, which Angelinabefore had taken: yet could he not descry any tracke or path, or somuch as the footing of a Horse; but thought himselfe in sufficientsecurity, being rid of them that first seized on him, and also ofthe rest, which followed in the pursuite of them.

　　For the losse of his beloved Angelina, he was the most wofull man inthe world, wandering one while this way, and then againe another,calling for her all about the Forrest, without any answere returningto him. And not daring to ride backe againe, on he travailed still,not knowing where to make his arrivall. And having formerly heard ofsavage ravenous beasts, which commonly live in such unfrequentedForrests: he not onely was in feare of loosing his owne life, but alsodespayred much for his Angelina, least some Lyon or Woolfe, hadtorne her body in peeces.

　　Thus rode on poore unfortunate Pedro, untill the breake of dayappeared, not finding any meanes to get forth of the Forrest, stillcrying and calling for his fayre friend, riding many timesbackeward, when as hee thought hee rode forward, untill hee becameso weake and faint, what with extreame feare, lowd calling, andcontinuing so long awhile without any sustenance, that the whole daybeing thus spent in vaine, and darke night sodainly come uppon him, hewas not able to hold out any longer.

　　Now was he in farre worse case then before, not knowing where, orhow to dispose of himselfe, or what might best be done in so great anecessity. From his Horse he alighted, and tying him by the bridleunto a great tree, uppe he climbed into the same Tree, fearing to bedevoured (in the night time) by some wilde beast, choosing rather tolet his Horse perish, then himselfe. Within a while after, the Moonebeganne to rise, and the skies appeared bright and cleare: yet dursthee not nod, or take a nap, least he should fall out of the tree;but sate still greeving, sighing, and mourning, desparing of everseeing his Angelina any more, for he could not be comforted by thesmallest hopefull perswasion, that any good Fortune might befall herin such a desolate Forrest, where nothing but dismall feares was to beexpected, and no likelihood that she should escape with life.

　　Now, concerning poore affrighted Angelina, who (as you heard before)knew not any place of refuge to flye unto: but even as it pleasedthe horse to carry her: she entred so farre into the Forrest, that shecould not devise where to seeke her owne safety. And therefore, evenas it fared with her friend Pedro, in the same manner did it fallout with her, wandering the whole night, and all the day following,one while taking one hopefull tracke, and then another, calling,weeping, wringing her hands, and greevously complaining of her hardfortune. At the length, perceiving that Pedro came not to her atall, she found a little path (which she lighted on by great goodfortune) even when dark night was apace drawing, and followed it solong, till it brought her within the sight of a small poore Cottage,whereto she rode on so fast as she could; and found therin a veryold man, having a wife rather more aged then he, who seeing her tobe without company, the old man spake thus unto her.

　　Faire Daughter (quoth he) whether wander you at such an unseasonablehoure, and all alone in a place so desolate? The Damosell weeping,replied; that she had lost her company in the Forrest, and enquiredhow neere shee was to Alagna. Daughter (answered the old man) thisis not the way to Alagna, for it is above six leagues hence. Then sheedesired to know, how farre off she was from such houses, where shemight have any reasonable lodging? There are none so neere, said theold man, that day light will give you leave to reach. May it pleaseyou then good Father (replied Angelina) seeing I cannot travalle anywhether else; for Gods sake, to et me remaine heere with you thisnight. Daughter answered the good old man, we can gladly give youentertainement here, for this night, in such poore manner as yousee: but let mee tell you withall, that up and downe these woods (aswell by night as day) walke companies of all conditions, and ratherenemies then friends, who do us many greevous displeasures and harmes.Now if by misfortune, you being here, any such people should come, andseeing you so lovely faire, as indeed you are, offer you any shameor injurie: Alas you see, it lies not in our power to lend you anyhelp or succour. I thought it good (therefore) to acquaint youheerewith, because if any such mischance do happen, you should notafterward complaine of us.

　　The yong Maiden, seeing the time to be so farre spent, albeit theold mans words did much dismay her, yet she thus replyed. If it be thewill of heaven, both you and I shall be defended from anymisfortune: but if any such mischance do happen, I account themeanes lesse deserving grief, if I fall into the mercy of men, then tobe devoured by wild beasts in this Forrest. So, being dismountedfrom her horse, and entred into the homely house; shee supt poorelywith the old man and his wife, with such meane cates as theirprovision affoorded: and after supper, lay downe in her garments onthe same poore pallet, where the aged couple tooke their rest, and wasvery well contented therewith, albeit she could not refraine fromsighing and weeping, to be thus divided from her deare Pedro, of whoselife and welfare she greatly despaired.

　　When it was almost day, she heard a great noise of people travailingby, whereupon sodainly slie arose, and ranne into a Garden plot, whichwas on the backside of the poore Cottage, espying in one of thecorners a great stacke of Hay, wherein she hid her selfe, to theend, that travelling strangers might not readily finde her there inthe house. Scarsely was she fully hidden, but a great company ofTheeves and Villaines, finding the doore open, rushed into theCottage, where looking round about them for some booty, they saw theDamosels horse stand ready sadled, which made them demand to whom itbelonged. The good old man, not seeing the Maiden present there, butimmagining that she had made some shift for her selfe, answeredthus. Gentlemen, there is no body here but my wife and my selfe: asfor this Horse, which seemeth to be escaped from the Owner; hee camehither yesternight, and we gave him house-roome heere, rather thento be devoured by Wolves abroad. Then said the principall of theTheevish crew: This horse shall be ours, in regard he hath no otherMaster, and let the owner come claime him of us.

　　When they had searched every corner of the poore Cottage, andfound no such prey as they looked for, some of them went into thebackeside; where they had left their Javelins and Targets, wherwiththey used commonly to travaile. It fortuned, that one of them, beingmore subtily suspitious then the rest, thrust his javelin into thestacke of Hay, in the very same place where the Damosell lay hidden,missing very little of killing her; for it entred so farre, that theiron head pierced quite thorough her Garments, and touched her leftbare brest: whereupon, shee was ready to cry out, as fearing thatshe was wounded: but considering the place where she was, she laystill, and spake not a word. This disordered company, after they hadfed on some young Kids, and other flesh which they brought with themthither, they went thence about their theeving exercise, taking theDamosels horse along with them.

　　After they were gone a good distance off, the good old man beganthus to question his Wife. What is become of (quoth hee) our youngGentlewoman, which came so late to us yesternight? I have not seen herto day since our arising. The old woman made answer, that she knew notwhere she was, and sought all about to finde her. Angelinaes fearesbeing well over-blowne, and hearing none of the former noise, whichmade her the better hope of their departure, came forth of theHay-stack; wherof the good old man was not a little joyfull, andbecause she had so well escaped from them: so seeing it was nowbroad day-light, he said unto her. Now that the morning is sofairely begun, if you can be so well contented, we will bring you to aCastle, which stands about two miles and an halfe hence, where youwill be sure to remaine in safety. But you must needs travaile thitheron foot, because the nightwalkers that happened hither, have takenaway your horse with them.

　　Angelina making little or no account of such a losse, entreated themfor charities sake, to conduct her to that Castle, which accordinglythey did, and arrived there betweene seven and eight of the clock. TheCastle belonged to one of the Orsini, being called, Liello di Campo diFiore, and by great good fortune, his wife was then there, she being avery vertuous and religious Lady. No sooner did she looke uponAngelina, but she knew her immediately, and entertaining her verywillingly, requested, to know the reason of her thus arriving there:which she at large related, and moved the Lady (who likewise knewPedro perfectly well) to much compassion, because he was a kinsman anddeare friend to her Husband; and understanding how the Theeves hadsurprized him, she feared, that he was slaine among them, whereuponshe spake thus to Angelina. Seeing you know not what is become of mykinsman Pedro, you shall remaine here with me, untill such time, as(if we heare no other tidings of him) you may with safety be sentbacke to Rome.

　　Pedro all this while sitting in the Tree, so full of griefe, as noman could be more; about the houre of midnight (by the brightsplendour of the Moone) espied about some twenty Wolves, who, so sooneas they got a sight of the Horse, ran and engirt him round about.The Horse when he perceived them so neere him, drew his head sostrongly back-ward, that breaking the reines of his bridle, helaboured to escape from them. But being beset on every side, andutterly unable to helpe himself, he contended with his teeth and feetein his owne defence, till they haled him violently to the ground,and tearing his body in pieces, left not a jot of him but the barebones, and afterward ran ranging thorow the Forest. At this sight,poore Pedro was mightily dismaied, fearing to speed no better then hisHorse had done, and therefore could not devise what was best to bedone; for he saw no likelihood, of getting out of the Forest withlife. But day-light drawing on apace, and he almost dead with cold,having stood quaking so long in the Tree; at length by continualllooking every where about him, to discerne the least glimpse of anycomfort; he espied a great fire, which seemed to be about halfe a mileoff from him.

　　By this time it was broad day, when he descended downe out of theTree, (yet not without much feare) and tooke his way towards the fire,where being arrived, he found a company of Shepheards banquettingabout it, whom he curteously saluting, they tooke pity on hisdistresse, and welcommed him kindly. After he had tasted of suchcheare as they had, and was indifferently refreshed by the goodfire; he discoursed his hard disasters to them, as also how hehappened thither, desiring to know, if any Village or Castle wereneere there about, where he might in better manner releeve himselfe.The Shepheards told him, that about a mile and an halfe from thence,was the Castle of Signior Liello di Campo di Fiore, and that hisLady was residing there; which was no meane comfort to poore Pedro,requesting that one of them would accompany him thither, as two ofthem did in loving manner, to rid him of all further feares.

　　When he was arrived at the Castle, and found there divers of hisfamiliar acquaintance: he laboured to procure some meanes, that theDamosell might bee sought for in the Forrest. Then the Lady callingfor her, and bringing her to him; he ran and caught her in hisarmes, being ready to swoune with conceite of joy, for never could anyman be more comforted, then he was at the sight of his Angelina, andquestionlesse, her joy was not a jot inferiour to his, such a simpathyof firme love was settled betweene them. The Lady of the Castle, aftershe had given them very gracious entertainment, and understood thescope of their bold adventure; she reproved them both somewhatsharpely, for presuming so farre without the consent of their Parents.But perceiving (notwithstanding all her remonstrances) that theycontinued still constant in their resolution, without any inequalityof either side; shee saide to her selfe. Why should this matter be anyway offensive to me? They love each other loyally; they are notinferiour to one another in birth, but in fortune; they are equallyloved and allied to my Husband, and their desire is both honest andhonorable. Moreover, what know I, if it be the will of Heaven tohave it so? Theeves intended to hang him, in malice to his name andkinred, from which hard fate he hath happily escaped. Her life wasendangered by a sharpe pointed Javeline, and yet her fairer starreswould not suffer her so to perish: beside, they have both escapedthe fury of ravenous wild beasts; and all these are apparant signes,that future comforts should recompence former passed misfortunes;farre be it therefore from me, to hinder the appointment of theHeavens.

　　Then turning her selfe to them, thus she proceeded. If your desirebe to joyne in honourable marriage, I am well contented therewith, andyour nuptials shall here be solemnized at my Husbands charges.Afterward both he and I will endeavour, to make peace betweene you andyour discontented Parents. Pedro was not a little joyfull at her kindeoffer, and Angelina much more then he; so they were married togetherin the Castle, and worthily feasted by the Lady, as Forrestentertainment could permit, and there they enjoyed the first fruits oftheir love. Within a short while after, the Lady and they (wellmounted on Horsebacke, and attended with an honourable traine)returned to Rome; where her Lord Liello and she prevailed so well withPedroes angry Parents: that the variance ended in love and peace,and afterward they lived lovingly together, till old age made themas honourable, as their true and mutuall affection formerly had done.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　DECLARING THE DISCREETE PROVIDENCE OF PARENTS, IN CARE OF THEIR

　　CHILDRENS LOVE AND THEIR OWNE CREDIT, TO CUT OFF

　　INCONVENIENCES, BEFORE THEY DO PROCEEDE TOO FARRE

　　Ricciardo Manardy, was found by Messer Lizio da Valbonna, as he satefast asleepe at his Daughters Chamber window, having his hand fastin hers, and she sleeping in the same manner. Whereupon, they arejoyned together in marriage, and their long loyall love mutuallyrecompenced.

　　Madam Eliza having ended her Tale, and heard what commendationsthe whole company gave thereof; the Queene commanded Philostratus,to tell a Novell agreeing with his owne minde, smiling thereat, thusreplyed. Faire Ladies, I have bene so often checkt and snapt, for myyesterdayes matter and argument of discoursing, which was both tediousand offensive to you; that if I intended to make you any amends, Ishould now undertake to tell such a Tale, as might put you into amirthfull humour. Which I am determined to do, in relating a briefeand pleasant Novell, not any way offensive (as I trust) butexemplary for some good notes of observation.

　　Not long since, there lived in Romania, a Knight, a very honestGentleman, and well qualified, whose name was Messer Lizio daValbonna, to whom it fortuned, that (at his entrance into age) byhis Lady and wife, called Jaquemina, he had a Daughter, the verychoycest and goodliest gentlewoman in all those places. Now becausesuch a happy blessing (in their olde yeeres) was not a littlecomfortable to them; they thought themselves the more bound in duty,to be circumspect of her education, by keeping her out ofover-frequent companies, but onely such as agreed best with theirgravity, and might give the least ill example to their Daughter, whowas named Catharina; as making no doubt, but by this their providentand wary respect, to match her in marriage answerable to their liking.There was also a yong Gentleman, in the very flourishing estate of hisyouthfull time, descended from the Family of the Manardy daBrettinoro, named Messer Ricciardo, who oftentimes frequented theHouse of Messer Lizio, and was a continuall welcome guest to hisTable, Messer Lizio and his wife making the like account of him,even as if hee [had] bene their owne Sonne.

　　This young Gallant, perceiving the Maiden to be very beautifull,of singular behaviour, and of such yeeres as was fit for marriage,became exceeding enamoured of her, yet concealed his affection soclosely as he could, which was not so covertly carried, but that sheperceived it, and grew into as good liking of him. Many times he hadan earnest desire to have conference with her, which yet still hedeferred, as fearing to displease her; at the length he lighted onan apt opportunity, and boldly spake to her in this manner. FaireCatharina, I hope thou wilt not let me die for thy love? SigniorRicciardo (replyed she suddenly againe) I hope you will extend thelike mercy to me, as you desire that I should shew to you. Thisanswere was so pleasing to Messer Ricciardo, that presently hesaide. Alas deare Love, I have dedicated all my fairest fortunes onelyto thy service, so that it remaineth soly in thy power to dispose ofme as best shall please thee, and to appoint such times of privateconversation, as may yeeld more comfort to my poore afflicted soule.

　　Catharina standing musing awhile, at last returned him this answere.Signio Ricciardo, quoth she, you see what a restraint is set on myliberty, how short I am kept from conversing with any one, that I holdthis our enterparlance now almost miraculous. But if you coulddevise any convenient meanes, to admit us more familiar freedome,without any prejudice to mine honour, or the least distaste to myParents; do but enstruct it, and I will adventure it. Ricciardo havingconsidered on many wayes and meanes, thought one to be the fittestof all; and therefore thus replyed. Catharina (quoth he) the onelyplace for our more private talking together, I conceive to be theGallery over your Fathers Garden. If you can winne your Mother tolet you lodge there, I will make meanes to climbe over the wall, andat the goodly gazing window, we may discourse so long as we please.Now trust me deare Love (answered Catharina) no place can be moreconvenient for our purpose, there shall we heare the sweete Birdssing, especially the Nightingale which I have heard singing thereall the night long; I will breake the matter to my Mother, and how Ispeede, you shall heare further from me. So, with divers partingkisses, they brake off conference, till their next meeting.

　　On the day following, which was towards the ending of the monethof May, Catharina began to complaine to her Mother that the season wasover-hot and tedious, to be still lodged in her Mothers Chamber,because it was an hinderance to her sleeping; and wanting rest, itwould be an empairing of her health. Why Daughter (quoth the Mother)the weather (as yet) is not so hot, but (in my minde) you may verywell endure it. Alas Mother, saide she, aged people, as you and myFather are, do not feele the heates of youthfull blood, by reason ofyour farre colder complexion, which is not to be measured by youngeryeeres. I know that well Daughter, replyed the Mother; but is it in mypower, to make the weather warme or coole, as thou perhaps wouldsthave it? Seasons are to be suffered, according to their severallqualities; and though the last night might seeme hot, this nextensuing may be cooler, and then thy rest will be the better. NoMother, quoth Catharina, that cannot be; for as Summer proceedethon, so the heate encreaseth, and no expectation can be of temperateweather, untill it groweth to Winter againe. Why Daughter, saide theMother, what wouldest thou have me to do? Mother (quoth she) if itmight stand with my Fathers good liking and yours, I would be sparedfrom the Garden Gallery, which is a great deale more coole lodged.There shall I heare the sweete Nightingale sing, as every night sheuseth to do, and many other pretty Birdes beside, which I cannot dolodging in your Chamber.

　　The Mother loving her Daughter dearely, as being somewhatover-fond of her, and very willing to give her contentment; promisedto impart her minde to her Father, not doubting but to compasse whatshee requested. When she had mooved the matter to Messer Lizio whoseage made him somewhat froward and teasty; angerly said to his wife.Why how now woman? Cannot our Daughter sleepe, except she heare theNightingale sing? Let there be a bed made for her in the Oven, andthere let the Crickets make her melody. When Catharina heard thisanswere from her Father, and saw her desire to be disappointed; notonely could she take any rest the night following, but also complainedmore of the heate then before, not suffering her Mother to take anyrest, which made her go angerly to her Husband in the morning, saying.Why Husband, have we but one onely Daughter, whom you pretend tolove right dearly, and yet can you be so carelesse of her, as to denieher a request, which is no more then reason? What matter is it toyou or me, to let her lodge in the Garden Gallery? Is her youngblood to be compared with ours? Can our weake and crazie bodies, feelethe frolicke temper of hers? Alas, she is hardly (as yet) out of herchildish yeeres, and Children have many desires farre differing fromours: the singing of Birdes is rare musicke to them, and chiefly theNightingale; whose sweete notes will provoke them to rest, whenneither Art or Physicke can do it.

　　Is it even so Wife? answered Messer Lizio. Must your will and minebe governed by our Daughter? Well be it so then, let her bed be madein the Garden Gallerie, but I will have the keeping of the key, bothto locke her in at night, and set her at liberty every morning. Woman,woman, yong wenches are wily, many wanton crotchets are busie in theirbraines, and to us that are aged, they sing like Lapwings, tellingus one thing, and intending another; talking of Nightingales, whentheir mindes run on Cocke-Sparrowes. Seeing Wife, she must needes haveher minde, let yet your care and mine extend so farre, to keepe herchastity uncorrupted, and our credulity from being abused. Catharinahaving thus prevailed with her Mother, her bed made in the GardenGallerie, and secret intelligence given to Ricciardo, for preparinghis meanes of accesse to her window; old provident Lizio lockes thedoore to bed-ward, and gives her liberty to come forth in the morning,for his owne lodging was neere to the same Gallery.

　　In the dead and silent time of night, when all (but Lovers) taketheir rest; Ricciardo having provided a Ladder of Ropes, with graplinghookes to take hold above and below, according as he had occasion touse it. By helpe thereof, first he mounted over the Garden wall, andthen climbde up to the Gallery window, before which (as is every wherein Italie) was a little round engirting Tarras, onely for a man tostand upon, for making cleane the window, or otherwise repairing it.Many nights (in this manner) enjoyed they their meetings,entermixing their amorous conference with infinite kisses and kindeembraces, as the window gave leave, he sitting in the Tarras, anddeparting alwayes before breake of day, for feare of beingdiscovered by any.

　　But, as excesse of delight is the Nurse to negligence, and begettethsuch an overpresuming boldnesse, as afterward proveth to be saucedwith repentance: so came it to passe with our over-fond Lovers, inbeing taken tardy through their owne folly. After they had manytimes met in this manner, the nights (according to the season) growingshorter and shorter, which their stolne delight made them lesserespective of, then was requisite in an adventure so dangerous: itfortuned, that their amorous pleasure had so farre transported them,and dulled their senses in such sort, by these their continuallnightly watchings; that they both fell fast asleepe, he having hishand closed in hers, and she one arme folded about his body, andthus they slept till broade day light. Old Messer Lizio, whocontinually was the morning Cocke to the whole House, going foorthinto his Garden, saw how his Daughter and Ricciardo were seated at thewindow. In he went againe, and going to his wives Chamber, saide toher. Rise quickly wife, and you shall see, what made your Daughterso desirous to lodge in the Garden Gallery. I perceive that shee lovedto heare the Nightingale, for she hath caught one, and holds himfast in her hand. Is it possible, saide the Mother, that ourDaughter should catch a live Nightingale in the darke? You shall seethat your selfe, answered Messer Lizio, if you will make hast, andgo with me.She, putting on her garments in great haste, followed her Husband,and being come to the Gallery doore, he opened it very softly, andgoing to the window, shewed her how they both sate fast asleepe, andin such manner as hath bene before declared: whereupon, sheeperceiving how Ricciardo and Catharina had both deceived her, wouldhave made an outcry, but that Messer Lizio spake thus to her. Wife, asyou love me, speake not a word, neither make any noyse: for, seeingshee hath loved Ricciardo without our knowledge, and they have hadtheir private meetings in this manner, yet free from any blamefuimputation; he shall enjoy her, and she him. Ricciardo is a Gentleman,well derived, and of rich possessions, it can be no disparagement tous, that Catharina match with him in mariage, which he neithershall, or dare deny to do, in regard of our Lawes severity; forclimbing up to my window with his Ladder of Ropes, whereby his life isforfeited to the Law, except our Daughter please to spare it, as itremaineth in her power to doe, by accepting him as her husband, oryeelding his life up to the Law, which surely she will not suffer,their love agreeing together in such mutuall manner, and headventuring so dangerously for her. Madam Jaquemina, perceiving thather husband spake very reasonably, and was no more offended at thematter; stept side with him behinde the drawne Curtaines, untillthey should awake of themselves. At the last, Ricciardo awaked, andseeing it was so farre in the day, thought himselfe halfe dead, andcalling to Catharina, saide.

　　Alas deare Love! what shall we doe? we have slept too long, andshall be taken here.

　　At which words, Messer Lizio stept forth from behind theCurtaines, saying. Nay, Signior Ricciardo, seeing you have foundsuch an unbefitting way hither, we will provide you a better foryour backe returning.

　　When Ricciardo saw the Father and Mother both there present, hecould not devise what to do or say, his senses became so strangelyconfounded; yet knowing how hainously he had offended, if thestrictnesse of Law should bee challenged against him, falling on hisknees, he saide. Alas Messer Lizio, I humbly crave your mercy,confessing my selfe well worthy of death, that knowing the sharperigour of the Law, I would presume so audaciously to breake it. Butpardon me worthy Sir, my loyall and unfeigned love to your DaughterCatharina, hath bene the only cause of my transgressing.

　　Ricciardo (replied Messer Lizio) the love I beare thee, and thehonest confidence I do repose in thee, step up (in some measure) toplead thine excuse, especially in the regard of my Daughter, whom Iblame thee not for loving, but for this unlawfull way of presumingto her. Neverthelesse, perceiving how the case now standeth, andconsidering withall, that youth and affection were the ground of thineoffence: to free thee from death, and my selfe from dishonour,before thou departest hence, thou shalt espouse my Daughter Catharina,to make her thy lawfull wife in marriage, and wipe off all scandall tomy House and me. All this while was poore Catharina on her kneeslikewise to her Mother, who (notwithstanding this her boldadventure) made earnest suite to her Husband to remit all, becauseRicciardo right gladly condiscended, as it being the maine issue ofhis hope and desire; to accept his Catharina in marriage, wheretoshe was as willing as he. Messer Lizio presently called for theConfessour of his House, and borrowing one of his Wives Rings,before they went out of the Gallery; Ricciardo and Catharina wereespoused together, to their no little joy and contentment.

　　Now had they more leasure for further conference, with the Parentsand kindred to Ricciardo, who being no way discontented with thissudden match, but applauding it in the highest degree; they werepublikely maried againe in the Cathedrall Church, and veryhonourable triumphes performed at the nuptials, living long after inhappy prosperity.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE FIFTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN MAY BE OBSERVED, WHAT QUARRELS AND CONTENTIONS ARE

　　OCCASIONED BY LOVE; WITH SOME PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION,

　　CONCERNING THE SINCERITY OF A LOYALL FRIEND

　　Guidotto of Cremona, out of this mortall life, left a Daughter ofhis, with Jacomino of Pavia. Giovanni di Severino, and Menghino daMinghole, fell both in love with the young Maiden, and fought for her;who being afterward knowne to be the Sister to Giovanni, she was givenin mariage to Menghino.

　　All the Ladies laughing heartily, at the Novell of theNightingale, so pleasingly delivered by Philostratus, when they sawthe same to be fully ended, the Queene thus spake. Now trust mePhilostratus, though yesterday you did much oppresse mee withmelancholly, yet you have made me such an amends to day, as we havelittle reason to complaine any more of you. So converting her speechto Madam Neiphila, shee commanded her to succeede with herdiscourse, which willingly she yeelded to, beginning in this manner.Seing it pleased Philostratus, to produce his Novell out of Romania: Imeane to walke with him in the same jurisdiction, concerning what I amto say.

　　There dwelt sometime in the City of Fano, two Lombards, the onebeing named Guidotto of Cremona, and the other Jacomino of Pavia,men of sufficient entrance into yeares, having followed the warres (asSouldiers) all their youthfull time. Guidotto feeling sicknesse toover-master him, and having no sonne, kinsman, or friend, in whom hemight repose more trust, then he did in Jacomino: having longconference with him about his worldly affaires, and setled his wholeestate in good order; he left a Daughter to his charge, about tenyeeres of age, with all such goods as he enjoyed, and then departedout of this life. It came to passe, that the City of Faenza, long timebeing molested with tedious warres, and subjected to very servilecondition; beganne now to recover her former strength, with freepermission (for all such as pleased) to returne and possesse theirformer dwellings. Whereupon, Jacomino (having sometime bene aninhabitant there) was desirous to live in Faenza againe, convayingthither all his goods, and taking with him also the young Girle, whichGuidotto had left him, whom hee loved, and respected as his ownechilde.

　　As shee grew in stature, so she did in beauty and vertuousqualities, as none was more commended throughout the whole City, forfaire, civill, and honest demeanour, which incited many amorously toaffect her. But (above all the rest) two very honest young men, ofgood fame and repute, who were so equally in love addicted to her,that being. jealous of each others fortune, in preventing of theirseverall hopefull expectation; a deadly hatred grew suddenlybetweene them, the one being named Giovanni de Severino, and the otherMenghino de Minghole. Either of these two young men, before theMaide was fifteene yeeres old, laboured to be possessed of her inmarriage, but her Guardian would give no consent thereto: wherefore,perceiving their honest intended meaning to be frustrated, they nowbegan to busie their braines, how to forestall one another by craftand circumvention.

　　Jacomino had a Maide-servant belonging to his House, somewhataged, and a Manservant beside, named Grinello, of mirthfulldisposition, and very friendly, with whom Giovanni grew in greatfamiliarity, and when he found time fit for the purpose, he discoveredhis love to him, requesting his furtherance and assistance, incompassing the height of his desire, with bountifull promises ofrich rewarding; wheret Grinello returned this answere. I know nothow to sted you in this case, but when my Master shall sup foorth atsome Neighbours house, to admit your entrance where shee is:because, if I offer to speake to her, she never will stay to hearemee. Wherefore, if my service this way may doe you any good, I promiseto performe it; doe you beside, as you shall finde it mostconvenient for you. So the bargaine was agreed on betweene them, andnothing else now remained, but to what issue it should sort in theend. Menghino, on the other side, having entred into theChamber-maides acquaintance, sped so well with her, that she deliveredso many messages from him, as had (already) halfe won the liking ofthe Virgin; passing further promises to him beside, of bringing him tohave conference with her, whensoever her Master should be absentfrom home. Thus Menghino being favoured (on the one side) by the byChamber-maide, and Giovanni (on the other) by trusty Grinello; theiramorous warre was now on foote, and diligently followed by boththeir sollicitors. Within a short while after, by the procurement ofGrinello, Jacomino was invited by a Neighbour to supper, in company ofdivers his familiar friends, whereof intelligence being given toGiovanni; a conclusion passed betweene them, that (upon a certainesignale given) he should come, and finde the doore standing readyopen, to give him all accesse unto the affected Mayden.

　　The appointed night being come, and neither of these hot Loversknowing the others intent, but their suspition being alike, andencreasing still more and more; they made choyce of certaine friendsand associates, well armed and provided, for eithers safer entrancewhen need should require.

　　Menghino stayed with his troope, in a neere neighbouring house tothe Mayden, attending when the signall would be given: but Giovanniand his consorts, were ambushed somewhat further off from the house,and both saw when Jacomino went foorth to supper. Now Grinello and theChambermaide began to vary, which should send the other out of theway, till they had effected their severall invention; wheruponGrinello said to her. What maketh thee to walke thus about thehouse, and why doest thou not get thee to bed? And thou (quoth theMaide) why doest thou not goe to attend on our Master, and tarry forhis returning home? I am sure thou hast supt long agoe, and I knowno businesse here in the house for thee to doe. Thus (by no meanes)the one could send away the other, but either remained as the othershinderance.

　　But Grinello remembring himselfe, that the houre of hisappointment with Giovanni was come, he saide to himselfe. What careI whether our olde Maide be present, or no? If she disclose anything that I doe, I can be revenged on her when I list. So, havingmade the signall, he went to open the doore, even when Giovanni (andtwo of his confederates) rushed into the House, and finding thefaire young Maiden sitting in the Hall, laide hands on her, to beareher away. The Damosell began to resist them, crying out for helpe soloude as she could, as the olde Chamber-maide did the like: whichMenghino hearing, he ranne thither presently with his friends, andseeing the young Damosell brought well-neere out of the House; theydrew their Swords, crying out: Traytors, you are but dead men, here isno violence to be offered, neither is this a booty for such basegroomes. So they layed about them lustily, and would not permit themto passe any further. On the other side, upon this mutinous noyseand outcry, the Neighbours came foorth of their houses, with lights,staves, and clubbes, greatly reproving them for this out-rage, yetassisting Menghino: by meanes whereof, after a long time ofcontention, Menghino recovered the Mayden from Giovanni, and placedher peaceably in Jacominoes House.

　　No sooner was this hurly burly somewhat calmed, but the Serjeants tothe Captine of the City, came thither, and apprehended divers of themutiners: among whom were Menghino, Giovanni, and Grinello, committingthem immediately to prison. But after every thing was pacified, andJacomino returned home to his house from supper; he was not a littleoffended at so grosse an injury. When he was fully informed, how thematter happened, and apparantly perceived, that no blame at allcould be imposed on the Mayden: he grew the better contented,resolving with himselfe (because no more such inconveniences shouldhappen) to have her married so soone as possibly he could.

　　When morning was come the kindred and friends on either side,understanding the truth of the errour committed, and knowing beside,what punishment would be inflicted on the prisoners, if Jacominopressed the matter no further, then as with reason and equity wellhe might; they repaired to him, and (in gentle speeches) entreatedhim, not to regard a wrong offered by unruly and youthfull people,meerely drawne into the action by perswasion of friends; submittingboth themselves, and the offendors, to such satisfaction as [he]pleased to appoint them. Jacomino, who had seene and observed manythings in his time, and was a man of sound understanding, returnedthem this answer.

　　Gentlemen, if I were in mine owne Country, as now I am in yours, Iwould as for wardly confesse my selfe your friend, as here I mustneedes fall short of any such service, but even as you shall please tocommand me. But plainely, and without all further ceremoniouscomplement, I must agree to whatsoever you can request; as thinkingyou to be more injured by me, then any great wrong that I havesustained. Concerning the young Damosell remaining in my House, she isnot (as many have imagined) either of Cremona, or Pavia, but borne aFaentine, here in this Citie: albeit neither my selfe, she, or he ofwhome I had her, did ever know it, or yet could learne whoseDaughter she was. Wherefore, the suite you make to me, should rather(in duty) be mine to you: for shee is a native of your owne, doe rightto her, and then you can doe no wrong unto mee.

　　When the Gentlemen understood, that the Mayden was borne inFaenza, they marvelled thereat, and after they had thanked Jacominofor his curteous answer; they desired him to let them know, by whatmeanes the Damosell came into his custody, and how he knew her to beborne in Faenza: when hee, perceiving them attentive to heare him,began in this manner.

　　Understand worthy Gentlemen, that Guidotto of Cremona, was mycompanion and deare friend, who growing neere to his death, tolde methat when this City was surprized by the Emperour Frederigo, and allthings committed to sacke and spoile; he and certaine of hisconfederates entred into a House, which they found to bee wellfurnished with goods, but utterly forsaken of the dwellers, onely thispoore Mayden excepted, being then aged but two yeeres, orthereabout. As hee mounted up the steps, with intent to depart fromthe House; she called him Father, which word moved him socompassionately, that he went backe againe, brought her away with him,and all things of worth which were in the House: going thenceafterward to Fano, and there deceasing, hee left her and all his goodsto my charge; conditionally, that I should see her married when duetime required, and bestow on her the wealth which he had left her.Now, very true it is, although her yeeres are convenient for marriage,yet I could never finde any one to bestow her on, at least that Ithought fitting for her: howbeit I will listen thereto much morerespectively, before any other such accident shall happen.

　　It came to passe, that in the reporting of this discourse, there wasthen a Gentleman in the company, named Guillemino da Medicina, whoat the surprizall of the City, was present with Guidotto of Cremona,and knew well the House which he had ransacked, the owner whereofwas also present with him, wherefore taking him aside, he said to him.Bernardino, hearest thou what Jacomino hath related? Yes very well,replyed Bernardino, and remember withall, that in that dismallbloody combustion, I lost a little Daughter, about the age as Jacominospeaketh. Questionlesse then replyed Guillemino, she must needs be thesame young Mayden, for I was there at the same time, and in the House,whence Guidotto did bring both the Girle and goods, and I do perfectlyremember, that it was thy House. I pray thee call to minde, ifeverthou sawest any scarre or marke about her, which may revive thyformer knowledge of her, for my minde perswades me, that the Maideis thy Daughter.

　　Bernardino musing awhile with himselfe, remembred, that under herleft eare, she had a scarre, in the forme of a little crosse, whichhappened by the byting of a Wolfe, and but a small while before thespoyle was made. Wherefore, without deferring it to any furthertime, he stept to Jacomino who as yet stayed there) and entreatedhim to fetch the Mayden from his house, because shee might be knowneto some in the company: whereto right willingly he condiscended, andthere presented the Maide before them. So soone as Bernardino beheldher, he began to be much inwardly moved, for the perfect characterof her Mothers countenance, was really figured in her sweete face;onely that her beauty was somewhat more excelling. Yet not herewithsatisfied, he desired Jacomino to bee so pleased, as to lift up alittle the lockes of haire, depending over her left eare. Jacomino didit presently, albeit with a modest blushing in the Maide, andBernardino looking advisedly on it, knew it to be the selfe-samecrosse, which confirmed her constantly to be his Daughter.

　　Overcome with excesse of joy, which made the teares to trickle downehis cheekes, he proffered to embrace and kisse the Maide: but sherefusing his kindnesse, because (as yet) she knew no reason for it,hee turned himselfe to Jacomino, saying. My deare brother andfriend, this Maide is my Daughter, and my House was the same whichGuidotto spoyled, in the generall havocke of our City, and thence hecarried this childe of mine, forgotten (in the fury) by my Wife herMother. But happy was the houre of his becomming her Father, andcarrying her away with him; for else she had perished in the fire,because the House was instantly burnt downe to the ground. TheMayden hearing his words, observing him also to be a man of yeeres andgravity: she beleeved what he saide, and humbly submitted her selfe tohis kisses and embraces, even as instructed thereto by instinct ofnature. Bernardino instantly sent for his wife, her owne Mother, hisdaughters, sonnes, and kindred, who being acquainted with thisadmirable accident, gave her most gracious and kinde welcome, hereceiving her from Jacomino as his childe, and the legacies whichGuidotto had left her.

　　When the Captaine of the City (being a very wise and worthyGentleman) heard these tydings, and knowing that Giovanni, then hisprisoner, was the Son to Bernardino, and naturall Brother to the newlyrecovered Maide: he bethought himselfe, how best he might qualifie thefault committed by him. And entring into the Hall among them,handled the matter so discreetly, that a loving league of peace wasconfirmed betweene Giovanni and Menghino, to whom (with free andfull consent on all sides) the faire Maide, named Agatha, was given inmarriage, with a more honourable enlargement of her dowry, andGrinello, with the rest, delivered out of prison, which for theirtumultuous riot they had justly deserved. Menghino and Agatha hadtheir wedding worthily solemnized, with all due honours belongingthereto; and long time after they had lived in Faenza, highly beloved,and graciously esteemed.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE SIXTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS MANIFESTED, THAT LOVE CAN LEADE A MAN INTO NUMBERLESSE

　　PERILS: OUT OF WHICH HE ESCAPETH WITH NO MEANE

　　DIFFICULTY.

　　Guion di Procida, being found familiarly conversing with a youngDamosell, which he loved; and had beene given (formerly) to Frederigo,King of Sicilie: was bound to a stake, to be consumed with fire.From which h dan ger (neverthelesse) he escaped, being knowne by DonRogiero de Oria, Lord Admirall of Sicilie, and afterward married theDamosell.

　　The Novell of Madame Neiphila being ended, which proved verypleasing to the Ladies: the Queene commanded Madam Pampinea, thatshe should prepare to take her turne next, whereto willinglyobeying, thus she began. Many and mighty (Gracious Ladies) are theprevailing powers of love, conducting amorous soules into infinitetravels, with inconveniences no way avoidable, and not easily to beforeseene, or prevented. As partly already hath bene observed, bydivers of our former Novels related, and some (no doubt) to ensuehereafter; for one of them (comming now to my memory) I shall acquaintyou withall, in so good tearmes as I can.

　　Ischia is an Iland very neere to Naples, wherein (not long since)lived a faire and lovely Gentlewoman, named Restituta, Daughter to aGentleman of the same Isle, whose name was Marino Bolgaro. A properyouth called Guion, dwelling also in a neere neighbouring Isle, calledProcida, did love her as dearly as his owne life, and she was asintimately affected towards him. Now because the sight of her washis onely comfort, as occasion gave him leave, he resorted to Ischiavery often in the day time, and as often also in the night season,when any Barke passed from Procida to Ischia; if to see nothingelse, yet to behold the walles that enclosed his Mistresse thus.

　　While this love continued in equall fervency, it chanced upon afaire Summers day, that Restituta walked alone upon the Sea-shore,going from Rocke to Rocke, having a naked knife in her hand, wherewithshe opened such Oysters as shee found among the stones, seeking forsmall pearles enclosed in their shelles. Her walke was very solitaryand shady, with a faire Spring or Well adjoyning to it, and thither(at that very instant time) certaine Sicilian young Gentlemen, whichcame from Naples, had made their retreate. They perceiving theGentlewoman to be very beautifull (she as yet not having any sightof them) and in such a silent place alone by her selfe: concludedtogether, to make a purchase of her, and carry her thence away withthem; as indeed they did, notwithstanding all her out cryes andexclaimes, bearing her perforce aboard their Barke.

　　Setting sayle thence, they arrived in Calabria, and then theregrew a great contention betweene them, to which of them this bootyof beauty should belong, because each of them pleaded a title toher. But when they could not grow to any agreement, but doubtedgreater disasters would ensue thereon, by breaking their former leagueof friendship: by an equall conformity in consent, they resolved, tobestow her as a rich present, on Frederigo King of Sicille, who wasthen young and joviall, and could not be pleased with a better gift;wherefore, they were no sooner landed at Palermo, but they didaccording as they had determined. The King did commend her beautyextraordinarily, and liked her farre beyond all his other Loves:but, being at that time empaired in his health, and his body muchdistempered by ill dyet; he gave command, that untill he should bein more able disposition, she must be kept in a goodly house of hisowne, erected in a beautifull Garden, called the Cube, where she wasattended in most pompous manner.Now grew the noyse and rumor great in Ischia, about this rape orstealing away of Restituta; but the chiefest greevance of all, was,that it could not be knowne how, by whom, or by what meanes. But Guiondi Procida, whom this injury concerned much more then any other: stoodnot in expectation of better tydings from Ischia, but h earing whatcourse the Barke had taken, made ready another, to follow after withall possible speede. Flying thus on the winged winds through the Seas,even from Minerva, unto the Scalea in Calabria, searching for his lostLove in every angle: at length it was told him at the Scalea, thatshee was carryed away by certaine Sicillian Marriners, to Palermo,whither Guion set sayle immediately.

　　After some diligent search made there, he understood, that she wasdelivered to the King, and he had given strict command, for keepingher in his place of pleasure, called the Cube: which newes were nota little greevous to him, for now he was almost quite out of hope, notonely of ever enjoying her, but also of seeing her. Neverthelesse,Love would not let him utterly despaire, whereupon he sent away hisBarque, and perceiving himselfe to be unknowne of any; he continuedfor some time in Palermo, walking many times by that goodly place ofpleasure. It chanced on a day, that keeping his walke as he used todo, Fortune was so favourable to him, as to let him have a sight ofher at her window; from whence also she had a full view of him, totheir exceeding comfort and contentment. And Guion observing, that theCube was seated in a place of small resort; approached so neere aspossibly he durst, to have some conference with Restituta.

　　As Love sets a keene edge on the dullest spirit, and (by a smalladvantage) makes a man the more adventurous: so this little time ofunseene talke, inspired him with courage, and her with witty advice,by what meanes his accesse might be much neerer to her, and theircommunication concealed from any discovery, the scituation of theplace, and benefit of time duly considered. Night must be the cloud totheir amorous conclusion, and therefore, so much thereof beingspent, as was thought convenient, he returned thither againe, providedof such grappling-yrons, as is required when men will clamber, madefast unto his hands and knees; by their helpe hee attained to thetop of the wall, whence discending downe into the Garden, there hefound the maine yard of a ship, whereof before she had given himinstruction, and rearing it up against her Chamber window, made thathis meanes for ascending thereto, she having left it open for hiseasier entrance.

　　You cannot denie (faire Ladies) but here was a very hopefullbeginning, and likely to have as happy an ending, were it not trueLoves fatal misery, even in the very height of promised assurance,to be thwarted by unkind prevention, and in such manner as I will tellyou. This night, intended for our Lovers meeting, proved disastrousand dreadfull to them both: for the King, who at the first sight ofRestituta, was highly pleased with her excelling beauty; gave order tohis Eunuches and other women, that a costly bathe should be preparedfor her, and therein to let her weare away that night, because thenext day he intended to visit her. Restituta being royally conductedfrom her Chamber to the Bathe, attended on with Torchlight, as ifshe had bene a Queene: none remained there behind, but such women aswaited on her, and the Guards without, which watched the Chamber.

　　No sooner was poore Guion aloft at the window, calling softly to hisMistresse, as if she had bene there; but he was over-heard by thewomen in the darke: and immediately apprehended by the Guard, whoforthwith brought him before the Lord Marshall, where beingexamined, and he avouching, that Restituta was his elected wife, andfor her he had presumed in that manner; closely was he kept inprison till the next morning. When he came into the Kings presence,and there boldly justified the goodnesse of his cause: Restitutalikewise was sent for, who no sooner saw her deare Love Guion, but sheran and caught him fast about the necke, kissing him in teares, andgreeving not a little at his hard fortune. Heereat the King grewexceedingly enraged, loathing and hating her now, much more thenformerly hee did affect her, and having himselfe seene by what strangemeanes he did climbe over the wall, and then mounted to her Chamberwindow; he was extreamely impatient, and could not otherwise beeperswaded, but that their meetings thus had bene very many.

　　Forthwith hee sentenced them both with death, commanding, thatthey should be conveyed thence to Palermo, and there (being striptstarke naked) be bound to a stake backe to backe, and so to standthe full space of nine houres, to see if any could take knowledge,of whence, or what they were; then afterward, to be consumed withfire. The sentence of death, did not so much daunt or dismay the pooreLovers, as the uncivill and unsightly manner, which (in feare of theKings wrathfull displeasure) no man durst presume to contradict.Wherefore, as he had commanded, so were they carryed thence toPalermo, and bound naked to a stake in the open Market place, and(before their eyes) the fire of wood brought, which was to consumethem, according to the houre as the King had appointed. You needenot make any question, what an huge concourse of people were sooneassembled together, to behold such a sad and wofull spectacle, eventhe whole City of Palermo, both men and women. The men were strickenwith admiration, beholding the unequalled beauty of faire Restituta,and the selfe-same passion possessed the women, seeing Guion to besuch a goodly and compleat young man: but the poore infortunate Loversthemselves, they stood with their lookes dejected to the ground, beingmuch pittied of all, but no way to be holpen or rescued by any,awaiting when the happy houre would come, to finish both their shameand lives together.

　　During the time of this tragicall expectation, the fame of thispublike execution being noysed abroade, calling all people farre andneere to behold it; it came to the eare of Don Rogiero de Oria, aman of much admired valour, and then Lord high Admirall of Sicily, whocame himselfe in person, to the place appointed for their death.First, he observed the Mayden, confessing her (in his soule) to be abeauty beyond all compare. Then looking on the young man, thus hesaide within himselfe: If the inward endowments of the mind, doeparalell the outward perfections of body; the World cannot yeeld amore compleate man. Now, as good natures are quickly incited tocompassion (especially in cases almost commanding it) and compassionknocking at the doore of the soule, doth quicken the memory withmany passed recordations: so this noble Admirall, advisedly, beholdingpoore condemned Guion, conceived, that he had somewhat seene himbefore this instant, and upon this perswasion (even as if divinevertue had tutored his tongue) he saide: Is not thy name Guion diProcida?

　　Marke now, how quickly misery can receive comfort, upon so poore andsilly a question; for Guion began to elevate his dejected countenance,and looking on the Admirall, returned him this answer. Sir, heretoforeI have bene the man which you speake of; but now, both that name andman must die with me. What misfortune (said the Admirall) hath thusunkindly crost thee? Love (answered Guion) and the Kingsdispleasure. Then the Admirall would needs know the whole history atlarge, which briefly was related to him, and having heard how allhad happened; as he was turning his Horse to ride away thence, Guioncalled to him, saying, Good my Lord, entreat one favour for me, ifpossibly it may be. What is that? replyed the Admirall. You see Sir(quoth Guior) that I am very shortly to breathe my last; all the gracewhich I do most humbly entreat, is, that as I am here with this chasteVirgin, (whom I honour and love beyond my life) and miserably boundbacke to backe: our faces may be turned each to other, to the end,that when the fire shall finish my life, by looking on her, my soulemay take her flight in full felicity. The Admirall smiling, said; Iwill do for thee what I can, and (perhaps) thou mayest so long lookeon her, as thou wilt be weary, and desire to looke off her.

　　At his departure, he commanded them that had the charge of thisexecution, to proceede no further, untill they heard more from theKing, to whom he gallopped immediately, and although he beheld himto bee very angerly moved; yet he spared not to speake in thismaner. Sir, wherin have those poore young couple offended you, thatare so shamefully to be burnt at Palermo? The King told him: wheretothe Admirall (pursuing still his purpose) thus replyed. Beleeve meSir, if true love be an offence, then theirs may be termed to beone; and albeit it deserved death, yet farre be it from thee toinflict it on them: for as faults doe justly require punishment, sodoe good turnes as equally merit grace and requitall. Knowest thouwhat and who they are, whom thou hast so dishonourably condemned tothe fire? Not I, quoth the King. Why then I will tell thee, answeredthe Admirall, that thou mayest take the better knowledge of them,and forbeare hereafter, to be so over violently transported withanger.

　　The young Gentleman, is the Sonne to Landolfo di Procida, theonely Brother to Lord John di Procida, by whose meanes thou becamestLord and King of this Countrey. The faire young Damosell, is theDaughter to Marino Bulgaro, whose power extendeth so farre, as topreserve thy prerogative in Ischia, which (but for him) had long sincebene out-rooted there. Beside, these two maine motives, to challengejustly grace and favour from thee; they are in the floure and pride oftheir youth, having long continued in loyall love together, andcompelled by fervency of endeared affection, not any will to displeasethy Majesty: they have offended (if it may be termed an offence tolove, and in such lovely young people as they are.) Canst thou thenfinde in thine heart to let them die, whom thou rather ought tohonour, and recompence with no meane rewards?When the King had heard this, and beleeved for a certainty, thatthe Admirall told him nothing but truth: he appointed not onely,that they should proceede no further, but also was exceedingsorrowfull for what he had done, sending presently to have themreleased from the Stake, and honourably to be brought before him.Being thus enstructed in their severall qualities, and standing induty obliged, to recompence the wrong which he had done, withrespective honours: he caused them to be cloathed in royallgarments, and knowing them to bee knit in unity of soule; the likehe did by marrying them solemnly together, and bestowing many richgifts and presents on them, sent them honourably attended home toIschia; where they were with much joy and comfort received, andlived long after in great felicity.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THE SUNDRY TRAVELS AND PERILLOUS ACCIDENTS,

　　OCCASIONED BY THOSE TWO POWERFULL COMMANDERS, LOVE AND FORTUNE,

　　THE INSULTING TYRANTS OVER HUMANE LIFE.

　　Theodoro falling in love with Violenta, the Daughter to hisMaster, named Amarigo, and she conceiving with child by him; wascondemned to be hanged. As they were leading him to the Gallowes,beating and misusing him all the way: he happened to be knowne ofhis owne Father, whereupon he was released, and afterward enjoyedViolenta in marriage.

　　Greatly were the Ladies minds perplexed, when they heard, that thetwo poore Lovers were in danger to be burned: but hearing afterward oftheir happy deliverance, for which they were as joyfull againe; uponthe concluding of the Novell, the Queene looked on Madame Lauretta,enjoyning her to tell the next Tale, which willingly she undertooke todo, and thus began.

　　Faire Ladies, at such time as the good King William reigned inSicily, there lived within the same Dominion, a young Gentleman, namedSignior Amarigo, Abbot of Trapani, who among his other worldlyblessings, (commonly termed the goods of Fortune) was notunfurnished of children; and therefore having neede of servants, hemade his provision of them the best he might. At that time, certaineGallies of Geneway Pyrates comming from the Easterne parts, whichcoasting along Armenia, had taken divers children; he bought some ofthem, thinking that they were Turkes. They all resembling clownishPeazants, yet there was one among them, who seemed to be of moretractable and gentle nature, yea, and of a more affable countenancethan any of the rest, being named Theodoro: who growing on inyeeres, (albeit he lived in the condition of a servant) was educatedamong Amarigoes Children, and as enstructed rather by nature, thenaccident, his conditions were very much commended, as also the featureof his body, which proved so highly pleasing to his Master Amarigo,that he made him a free man, and imagining him to be a Turke, causedhim to be baptized, and named Pedro, creating him superintendent ofall his affaires, and reposing his-chiefest trust in him.

　　As the other Children of Signior Amarigo grew in yeeres and stature,so did a Daughter of his, named Violenta, a very goodly and beautifullDamosell, somewhat over-long kept from marriage by her Fatherscovetousnesse, and casting an eye of good liking on poore Pedro.Now, albeit shee loved him very dearly, and all his behaviour was mostpleasing to her, yet maiden modesty forbad her to reveale it, tillLove (too long concealed) must needes disclose it selfe. Which Pedroat the length tooke notice of, and grew so forward towards her inequality of affection, as the very sight of her was his onelyhappinesse. Yet very fearefull he was, least it should be noted,either by any of the House, or the Mayden her selfe: who yet wellobserved it, and to her no meane contentment, as it appeared nolesse (on the other side) to honest Pedro.

　　While thus they loved together meerely in dumbe shewes, not daringto speake to each other, (though nothing more desired) to finde someease in this their oppressing passions: Fortune, even as if shepittied their so long languishing, enstructed them how to finde outa way, whereby they might both better releeve themselves. SigniorAmarigo, about some two or three miles distance from Trapani, had aCountrey-House or Farme, whereto his Wife, with her Daughter andsome other women, used oftentimes to make their resort, as it werein sportfull recreation; Pedro alwayes being diligent to man themthither. One time among the rest, it came to passe, as often itfalleth out in the Summer season, that the faire Skie becamesuddenly over-clouded, even as they were returning home towardsTrapani, threatning a storme of raine to overtake them, except theymade the speedier haste.

　　Pedro, who was young, and likewise Violenta, went farre more lightlythen her Mother and her company, as much perhaps provoked by love,as feare of the sudden raine falling, and paced on so fast beforethem, that they were wholly out of sight. After many flashes oflightning, and a few dreadfull clappes of thunder, there fell such atempestuous showre of hayle, as compelled the Mother and her traine toshelter themselves in a poore Countrey-mans Cottage. Pedro andViolenta, having no other refuge, ranne likewise into a pooreSheepecoate, so over-ruined, as it was in danger to fall on theirheads; and no body dwelt in it, neither stood any other house neereit, and it was scarsely any shelter for them, howbeit, necessityenforceth to make shift with the meanest. The storme encreasing moreand more, and they coveting to avoyd it as well as they could;sighes and drie hemmes were often inter-vented, as dumbly (before)they were wont to doe, when willingly they could affoord another kindeof speaking.

　　At last Pedro tooke heart, and saide: I would this showre wouldnever cease, that I might be alwayes where I am. The like could Iwish, answered Violenta, so we were in a better place of safety. Thesewishes drew on other gentle language, with modest kisses and embraces,the onely ease to poore Lovers soules; so that the raine ceased not,till they had taken order for their oftner conversing, and absoluteplighting of their faiths together. By this time the storme wasfairely over-blowne, and they attending on the way, till the Motherand the rest were come, with whom they returned to Trapani, where bywise and provident meanes, they often conferred in private together,and enjoyed the benefit of their amorous desires, yet free from anyill surmise or suspition.

　　But, as Lovers felicities are sildome permanent, without oneencountring crosse or other: so these stolne pleasures of Pedro andViolenta, met with as sowre a sauce in the farewell. For shee provedto be conceived with childe, then which could befall them no heavieraffliction, and Pedro fearing to loose his life therefore,determined immediate Right, and revealed his purpose to Violenta.Which when she heard, she told him plainly, that if he fled,forth-with she would kill her selfe. Alas deare Love (quoth Pedro)with what reason can you wish my tarrying here? This conception ofyours, doth discover our offence, which a Fathers pity may easilypardon in vou: but I being his servant and vassall, shall bepunished both for your sinne and mine, because he will have no mercyon me. Content thy selfe Pedro, replyed Violenta, I will take suchorder for mine owne offence, by the discreete counsell of my lovingMother, that no blame shall any way be taide on thee, or so much asa surmise, except thou wilt fondly betray thy selfe. If you can do so,answered Pedro, and constantly maintaine your promise; I will notdepart, but see that you prove to bee so good as your word.

　　Violenta, who had concealed her amisse so long as she could, and sawno other remedy, but now at last it must needes be discovered; wentprivately to her Mother, and (in teares) revealed her infirmity,humbly craving her pardon, and furtherance in hiding it from herFather. The Mother being extraordinarily displeased, chiding herwith many sharpe and angry speeches, would needes know with whomshee had thus offended. The Daughter (to keepe Pedro from anydetection) forged a Tale of her owne braine, farre from any truthindeede, which her Mother verily beleeving, and willing to preserveher Daughter from shame, as also the fierce anger of her Husband, hebeing a man of very implacable nature: conveyed her to the CountreyFarme, whither Signior Amarigo sildome or never resorted, intending(under the shadow of sicknesse) to let her lye in there, without theleast suspition of any in Trapani.

　　Sinne and shame can never be so closely carryed, or clouded with thegreatest cunning; but truth hath a loop-light whereby to discoverit, even when it supposeth it selfe in the surest safety. For, onthe very day of her detiverance, at such time as the Mother, andsome few friends (sworne to secrecy) were about the businesse, SigniorAmarigo, having beene in company of other Gentlemen, to flye his Hawkeat the River, upon a sudden, (but very unfortunately, albeit hee wasalone by himselfe) stept into his Farm-house, even to the next roomewhere the women were, and heard the newborne Babe to cry, whereatmarvelling not a little, he called for his Wife, to know what youngchilde cryed in his House. The Mother, amazed at his strange commingthither, which never before he had used to doe, and pittying thewofull distresse of her Daughter, which now could bee no longercovered, revealed what happened to Violenta. But he, being nothingso rash in beliefe, as his Wife was, made answere, that it wasimpossible for his Daughter to be conceived with childe, because henever observed the least signe of love in her to any man whatsoever,and therefore he would be satisfied in the truth, as shee expected anyfavour from him, or else there was no other way but death.

　　The Mother laboured by all meanes she could devise, to pacifie herHusbands fury, which proved all in vaine; for being thus impatientlyincensed, he drew foorth his Sword, and stepping with it drawne intothe Chamber (where she had bene delivered of a goodly Sonne) he saidunto her. Either tell me who is the Father of this Bastard, or thouand it shall perish both together. Poore Violenta, lesse respectingher owne life, then she did the childes; forgot her solemne promisemade to Pedro, and discovered all. Which when Amarigo had heard, hegrew so desperately enraged, that hardly he could forbeare fromkilling her. But after hee had spoken what his fury enstructed him,hee mounted on Horsebacke againe, ryding backe to Trapani, where heedisclosed the injury which Pedro had done him, to a noble Gentleman,named Signior Conrado, who was Captaine for the King over the City.

　　Before poore Pedro could have any intelligence, or so much assuspected any treachery against him; he was suddenly apprehended,and being called in question, stood not on any deniall, butconfessed truly what hee had done: whereupon, within some few dayesafter, he was condemned by the Captaine, to be whipt to the place ofexecution, and afterward to be hanged by the necke. Signior Amarigo,because he would cut off (at one and the same time) not onely thelives of the two poore Lovers, but their childes also; as afranticke man, violently carried from all sense of compassion, evenwhen Pedro was led and whipt to his death: he mingled strong poyson ina Cup of wine, delivering it to a trusty servant of his owne, and anaked Rapier withall, speaking to him in this manner. Goe carrythese two presents to my late Daughter Violenta, and tell her from me,that in this instant houre, two severall kinds of death are offeredunto her, and one of them she must make choyce of, either to drinkethe poyson, and so dye, or to run her body on this Rapiers point,which if she denie to doe, she shall be haled to the publike marketplace, and presently be burned in the sight of her lewd companion,according as shee hath worthily deserved. When thou hast delivered herthis message, take he- Bastard brat, so lately since borne, and dashhis braines out against the walles, and afterward throw him to myDogges to feede on.

　　When the Father had given this cruell sentence, both against hisowne Daughter, and her young Sonne, the servant readier to do evill,then any good, went to the place where his Daughter was kept. Poorecondemned Pedro, (as you have heard) was led whipt to the Gibbet,and passing (as it pleased the Captaines Officers to guide him) by afaire Inne: at the same time were lodged there three chiefe persons ofArminia, whom the King of the Countrey had sent to Rome, asAmbassadours to the Popes Holinesse, to negociate about an importantbusinesse neerely concerning the King and State. Reposing there forsome few dayes, as being much wearied with their journey., andhighly honoured by the Gentlemen of Trapani, especially SigniorAmarigo; these Ambassadours standing in their Chamber window, heardthe wofull lamentations of Pedro in his passage by.

　　Pedro was naked from the middle upward, and his hands bound fastbehind him, but being well observed by one of the Ambassadours, aman aged, and of great authority, named Phinio: hee espied a great redspot upon his breast, not painted, or procured by his punishment,but naturally imprinted in the flesh, which women (in these parts)terme the Rose. Upon the sight hereof, he suddenly remembred a Sonneof his owne, which was stolne from him about fifteene yeeres before,by Pyrates on the Sea-coast of Laiazzo, never hearing any tydings ofhim afterward. Upon further consideration, and comparing his Sonnesage with the likelyhood of this poore wretched mans; thus he conferredwith his owne thoughts. If my Sonne (quoth he) be living, his age isequall to this mans time, and by the red blemish on his breast, itplainely speakes him for to bee my Sonne.

　　Moreover, thus he conceived, that if it were he, he could not butremember his owne name, his Fathers, and the Armenian Language;wherefore, when he was just opposite before the window, hee calledaloud to him, saying: Theodoro. Pedro hearing the voyce, presentlylifted up his head, and Phinio speaking Armenian, saide: Of whence artthou, and what is thy Fathers name? The Sergeants (in reverence to theLord Ambassador) stayed awhile, till Pedro had returned his answer,who saide. I am an Armenian borne, Sonne to one Phineo, and wasbrought hither I cannot tell by whom. Phineo hearing this, knew thenassuredly, that this was the same Sonne which he had lost;wherefore, the teares standing in his eyes with conceite of joy, downehe descended from the window, and the other Ambassadors with him,running in among the Sergeants to embrace his Sonne, and casting hisowne rich Cloake about his whipt body, entreating them to forbeare andproceed no further, till they heard what command he should returnewithall unto them; which very willingly they promised to do.

　　Already, by the generall rumour dispersed abroad, Phineo hadunderstood the occasion, why Pedro was thus punished, and sentenced tobee hanged: wherefore, accompanied with his fellow Ambassadors, andall their attending traine, he went to Signior Conrado, and spake thusto him. My Lord, he whom you have sent to death as a slave, is afree Gentleman borne, and my Sonne, able to make her amends whom hehath dishonoured, by taking her in marriage as his lawfull Wife. Letme therefore entreat you, to make stay of the execution, ill it may beknowne, whether she will accept him as her Husband, or no; least (ifshe be so pleased) you offend directly against your owne Law. WhenSignior Conrado heard, that Pedro was Sonne to the Lord Ambassador, hewondred thereat not a little, and being somewhat ashamed of hisfortunes errour, confessed, that the claime of Phineo wascomformable to Law, and ought not to be denied him; going presently tothe Counsell Chamber, sending for Signior Amarigo immediately thither,and acquainting him fully with the case.

　　Amarigo, who beleeved that his Daughter and her Child were alreadydead, was the wofullest man in the World, for his so rashproceeding, knowing very well, that if she were not dead, the scandallwould easily be wipt away with credit. Wherefore he sent in allpoast haste, to the place where his Daughter lay, that if hiscommand were not already executed, by no meanes to have it done atall. He who went on this speedy errand, found there SigniorAmarigoes servant standing before Violenta, with the Cup of poysonin the one hand, and the drawne Rapier in the other, reproaching herwith very foule and injurious speeches, because she had delayed thetime so long, and would not accept the one or other, striving (byviolence) to make her take the one. But hearing his Masters command tothe contrary, he left her, and returned backe to him, certifying himhow the case stood.

　　Most highly pleased was Amarigo with these glad newes, and goingto the Ambassadour Phineo, in teares excused himselfe (so well as hecould) for his severity, and craving pardon; assured him, that ifTheodoro would accept his Daughter in marriage, willingly he wouldbestow her on him. Phineo allowed his excuses to be tollerable, andsaide beside; If my Son will not marry your Daughter, then let thesentence of death be executed on him. Amarigo and Phineo being thusaccorded, they went to poore Theodoro, fearefully looking every minutewhen he should dye, yet joyfull that he had found his Father, whopresently moved the question to him. Theodoro hearing that Violentashould bee his Wife, if he would so accept her: was over come withsuch exceeding joy, as if he had leapt out of hell into Paradise;confessing, that no greater felicity could befall him, if Violenta herselfe were so well pleased as he.

　　The like motion was made to her, to understand her disposition inthis case, who hearing what good hap had befalne Theodoro, and nowin like manner must happen to her: whereas not long before, when twosuch violent deathes were prepared for her, and one of them sheemust needs embrace, she accounted her misery beyond all otherwomens, but she now thought her selfe above all in happinesse, ifshe might be wife to her beloved Theodoro, submitting her selfewholy to her Fathers disposing. The marriage being agreed onbetweene them, it was celebrated with great pompe and solemnity, agenerall Feast being made for all the Citizens, and the youngmarried couple nourished up their sweete Son, which grew to be avery comely childe.

　　After that the Embassie was dispatched at Rome, and Phineo (with therest) was returned thither againe; Violenta did reverence him as herowne naturall Father, and he was not a little proud of so lovely aDaughter, beginning a fresh feasting againe, and continuing the same awhole moneth together. Within some short while after, a Galley beingfairely furnished for the purpose, Phineo, his Sonne, Daughter, andtheir young Sonne, went aboard, sayling away thence to Laiazzo,where afterward they lived in much tranquility.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE EIGHTH NOVELL

　　DECLARING, THAT LOVE NOT ONELY MAKES A MAN PRODIGALL, BUT ALSO AN

　　ENEMY TO HIMSELFE. MOREOVER, ADVENTURE OFTENTIMES BRINGETH SUCH

　　MATTERS TO PASSE, AS WIT AND CUNNING IN MAN

　　CAN EVER COMPREHEND

　　Anastasio, a Gentleman of the Family of the Honesti, by loving theDaughter to Signior Paulo Traversario, lavishly wasted a great part ofhis substance, without receiving any love from her againe. Byperswasion of some of his kindred and friends, he went to a Countreydwelling of his, called Chiasso, where he saw a Knight desperatelypursue a young Damosell; whom he slew, and afterward gave her to bedevoured by his Hounds. Anastasio invited his friends, and hers alsowhom he so dearely loved, to take part of a dinner with him, wholikewise saw the same Damosell so torne in peeces: which his unkindLove perceiving, and fearing least the like ill fortune shouldhappen to her; she accepted Anastasio to be her Husband.

　　So soone as Madam Lauretta held her peace, Madam Pampinea (by theQueenes command) began, and said. Lovely Ladies, as pitty is mosthighly commended in our sexe, even so is cruelty in us as severelyrevenged (oftentimes) by divine ordination. Which that you may thebetter know, and learne likewise to shun, as a deadly evill; I purposeto make apparant by a Novell, no lesse full of compassion, thendelectable.

　　Ravenna being a very ancient City in Romania, there dwelt sometime agreat number of worthy Gentlemen, among whom I am to speake of onemore especially, named Anastasio, descended from the Family of theHonesti, who by the death of his Father, and an Unckle of his, wasleft extraordinarily abounding in riches, and growing to yearesfitting for marriage, (as young Gallants are easily apt enough todo) he became enamored of a very bountifull Gentlewoman, who wasDaughter to Signior Paulo Traversario, one of the most ancient andnoble Families in all the Countrey. Nor made he any doubt, but byhis meanes and industrious endeavour, to derive affection from heragaine; for he carried himselfe like a brave-minded Gentleman,liberall in his expences, honest and affable in all his actions, whichcommonly are the true notes of a good nature, and highly to becommended in any man. But, howsoever Fortune became his enemy, theselaudable parts of manhood did not any way friend him, but ratherappeared hurtfull to himselfe: so cruell, unkind, and almost meerelysavage did she shew her selfe to him; perhaps in pride of her singularbeauty, or presuming on her nobility by birth, both which are ratherblemishes, then ornaments in a woman, especially when they be abused.

　　The harsh and uncivill usage in her, grew very distastefull toAnastasio, and so unsufferable, that after a long time of fruitlesseservice, requited still with nothing but coy disdaine; desperateresolutions entred into his brain, and often he was minded to killhimselfe. But better thoughts supplanting those furious passions, heabstained from any such violent act; and governed by more manlyconsideration, determined, that as shee hated him, he would requiteher with the like, if he could: wherein he became altogether deceived,because as his hopes grew to a dayly decaying, yet his love enlargedit selfe more and more.

　　Thus Anastasio persevering still in his bootlesse affection, and hisexpences not limited within any compasse; it appeared in the judgementof his Kindred and Friends, that he was falne into a mightyconsumption, both of his body and meanes. In which respect, many timesthey advised him to leave the City of Ravenna, and live in someother place for such a while; as might set a more moderate stintupon his spendings, and bridle the indiscreete course of his love, theonely fuell which fed this furious fire.

　　Anastasio held out thus a long time, without lending an eare to suchfriendly counsell: but in the end, he was so neerely followed by them,as being no longer able to deny them, he promised to accomplishtheir request. Whereupon, making such extraordinary preparation, as ifhe were to set thence for France or Spaine, or else into somefurther distant countrey: he mounted on horsebacke, and accompaniedwith some few of his familiar friends, departed from Ravenna, and rodeto a countrey dwelling house of his owne, about three or foure milesdistant from the Cittie which was called Chiasso, and there (upon avery goodly greene) erecting divers Tents and Pavillions, such asgreat persons make use of in the time of a Progresse: he said to hisfriends, which came with him thither, that there he determined to makehis abiding, they all returning backe unto Ravenna, and might cometo visite him againe so often as they pleased.

　　Now, it came to passe, that about the beginning of May, it beingthen a very milde and serrene season, and he leading there a much moremagnificent life, then ever hee had done before, inviting divers todine with him this day, and as many to morrow, and not to leave himtill after supper: upon the sodaine, falling into remembrance of hiscruell Mistris, hee commanded all his servants to forbeare hiscompany, and suffer him to walke alone by himselfe awhile, becausehe had occasion of private meditations, wherein he would not (by anymeanes) be troubled. It was then about the ninth houre of the day, andhe walking on solitary all alone, having gone some halfe milesdistance from his Tents, entred into a Grove of Pine-trees, neverminding dinner time, or any thing else, but onely the unkind requitallof his love.

　　Sodainly he heard the voice of a woman, seeming to make mostmournfull complaints, which breaking off his silent considerations,made him to lift up his head, to know the reason of this noise. Whenhe saw himselfe so farre entred into the Grove, before he couldimagine where he was; hee looked amazedly round about him, and outof a little thicket of bushes and briars round engirt with spreadingtrees, hee espyed a young Damosell come running towards him, nakedfrom the middle upward, her haire dishevelled on her shoulders, andher faire skinne rent and torne with the briars and brambles, sothat the blood ran trickling downe mainely; she weeping, wringingher hands, and crying out for mercy so lowde as she could. Twofierce Bloodhounds also followed swiftly after, and where theirteeth tooke hold, did most cruelly bite her. Last of all (mounted on alusty blacke Courser) came gallopping a Knight, with a very sterne andangry countenance, holding a drawne short Sword in his hand, givingher very vile and dreadfull speeches, and threatning every minute tokill her.

　　This strange and uncouth sight, bred in him no meane admiration,as also kinde compassion to the unfortunate woman; out of whichcompassion, sprung an earnest desire, to deliver her (if he could)from a death so full of anguish and horror: but seeing himselfe tobe without Armes, he ran and pluckt up the plant of a Tree, whichhandling as if it had bene a staffe, he opposed himselfe against theDogges and the Knight, who seeing him comming, cryed out in thismanner to him. Anastasio, put not thy selfe in any opposition, butreferre to my Hounds and me, to punish this wicked woman as she hathjustly deserved. And in speaking these words, the Hounds tooke fasthold on her body, so staying her, untill the Knight was come neerer toher, and alighted from his horse: when Anastasio (after some otherangry speeches) spake thus unto him: I cannot tell what or who thouart, albeit thou takest such knowledge of me, yet I must say, thatit is meere cowardize in a Knight, being armed as thou art, to offerto kill a naked woman, and make thy dogges thus to seize on her, as ifshe were a savage beast; therefore beleeve me, I will defend her sofarre as I am able.

　　Anastasio, answered the Knight, I am of the same City as thou art,and do well remember, that thou wast a little Ladde, when I (who wasthen named Guido Anastasio, and thine Unckle) became as intirely inlove with this woman, as now thou art of Paulo Traversarioes daughter.But through her coy disdaine and cruelty, such was my heavy fate, thatdesperately I slew my selfe with this short sword which thou beholdestin mine hand: for which rash sinfull deede, I was, and am condemned toeternall punishment. This wicked woman, rejoycing immeasurably in mineunhappy death, remained no long time alive after me, and for hermercilesse sinne of cruelty, and taking pleasure in my oppressingtorments; dying unrepentant, and in pride of her scorne, she had thelike sentence of condemnation pronounced on her, and sent to thesame place where I was tormented.

　　There the three impartiall judges, imposed this further inflictionon us both; namely, that she should flye in this manner before me, andI (who loved her so deerely while I lived) must pursue her as mydeadly enemy, not like a woman that had a taste of love in her. And sooften as I can overtake her, I am to kill her with this sword, thesame Weapon wherewith I slew my selfe. Then am I enjoyned, therewithto open her accursed body, and teare out her hard and frozen heart,with her other inwards, as now thou seest me doe, which I give unto myHounds to feede on. Afterward, such is the appointment of the supreamepowers, that she re-assumeth life againe, even as if she had notbene dead at all, and falling to the same kinde of flight, I with myHounds am still to follow her; without any respite or intermission.Every Friday, and just at this houre, our course is this way, whereshe suffereth the just punishment inflicted on her. Nor do we rest anyof the other dayes, but are appointed unto other places, where shecruelly executed her malice against me, being now (of her deareaffectionate friend) ordained to be her endlesse enemy, and topursue her in this manner for so many yeares, as she exercised monethsof cruelty, towards me. Hinder me not then, in being the executionerof divine justice; for all thy interposition is but in vaine, inseeking to crosse the appointment of supreame powers.

　　Anastasio having attentively heard all this discourse, his hairestood upright like Porcupines quils, and his soule was so shakenwith the terror, that he stept backe to suffer the Knight to do whathe was enjoyned, looking yet with milde commisseration on the poorewoman. Who kneeling Most humbly before the Knight, and stearnelyseized on by the two blood-hounds, he opened her brest with hisweapon, drawing foorth her heart and bowels, which instantly hethrew to the dogges, and they devoured them very greedily. Sooneafter, the Damosell (as if none of this punishment had beneinflicted on her) started up sodainly, running amaine towards theSea shore, and the Hounds swiftly following her, as the Knight did thelike, after he had taken his sword, and was mounted on horsebacke;so that Anastasio had soone lost all sight of them, and could notgesse what was become of them.

　　After he had heard and observed all these things, he stoode awhile as confounded with feare and pitty, like a simple silly man,hoodwinkt with his owne passions, not knowing the subtle enemiescunning illusions in offering false suggestions to the sight, to workehis owne ends thereby, and encrease the number of his deceivedservants. Forthwith he perswaded himselfe, that he might make good useof this womans tormenting, so justly imposed on the Knight toprosecute, if thus it should continue still every Friday. Wherefore,setting a good note or marke upon the place, he returned backe tohis owne people, and at such time as he thought convenient, sent fordivers of his kindred and friends from Ravenna, who being present withhim, thus he spake to them.

　　Deare Kinsmen and Friends, ye have a long while importuned me, todiscontinue my over-doating love to her, whom you all thinke, and Ifind to be my mortall enemy: as also, to give over my lavish expences,wherein I confesse my selfe too prodigall; both which requests ofyours, I will condiscend to, provided, that you will performe onegracious favour for me; Namely, that on Friday next, Signior PauloTraversario, his wife, daughter, with all other women linked in linageto them, and such beside onely as you shall please to appoint, willvouchsafe to accept a dinner heere with wi me; as for the reasonthereto mooving me, you shall then more at large be acquaintedwithall. This appeared no difficult matter for them to accomplish:wherefore, being returned to Ravenna, and as they found the timeanswerable to their purpose, they invited such as Anastasio hadappointed them. And although they found it some-what an hard matter,to gaine her company whom he so deerely affected; yet notwithstanding,the other women won her along with them.

　　A most magnificent dinner had Anastasio provided, and the tableswere covered under the Pine-trees, where he saw the cruell Lady sopursued and slaine: directing the guests so in their seating, that theyong Gentlewoman his unkinde Mistresse, sate with her face oppositeunto the place, where the dismall spectacle was to be seene. About theclosing up of dinner, they beganne to heare the noise of the pooreprosecuted Woman, which drove them all to much admiration; desiring toknow what it was, and no one resolving them, they arose from theTables, and looking directly as the noise came to them, they espyedthe wofull Woman, the Dogges eagerly pursuing her; and the armedKnight on horsebacke, gallopping fiercely after them with his drawneweapon, and came very nere unto the company, who cryed out with lowdexclaimes against the dogs and the Knight, stepping forth inassistance of the injured woman.

　　The Knight spake unto them, as formerly he had done to Anastasio,(which made them draw backe, possessed with feare and admiration)acting the same cruelty as he did the Friday before, not differingin the least degree. Most of the Gentlewomen there present, beingneere allyed to the unfortunate Woman, and likewise to the Knight,remembring well both his love and death, did shed teares asplentifully, as if it had bin to the very persons themselves, inusuall performance of the action indeede. Which tragicall Sceene beingpassed over, and the Woman and Knight gone out of their sight: allthat had seene this straunge accident, fell into diversity of confusedopinions, yet not daring to disclose them, as doubting some furtherdanger to ensue thereon.

　　But beyond all the rest, none could compare in feare andastonishment with the cruell yong Maide affected by Anastasio, whoboth saw and observed all with a more inward apprehension, knowingvery well, that the morall of this dismall spectacle, carried a muchneerer application to her then any other in all the company. For nowshe could call to mind, how unkinde and cruell she had shewne herselfe to Anastasio, even as the other Gentlewoman formerly did toher Lover, still flying from him in great contempt and scorne: forwhich, she thought the Blood-hounds also pursued her at the heelesalready, and a sword of vengeance to mangle her body. This fearegrew so powerfull in her, that to prevent the like heavy doome fromfalling on her, she studied (by all her best and commendable meanes,and therein bestowed all the night season) how to change her hatredinto kinde love, which at the length she fully obtained, and thenpurposed to prosecute in this manner.

　　Secretly she sent a faithfull Chambermaide of her owne, to greeteAnastasio on her behalfe; humbly entreating him te come see her:because now she was absolutely determined, to give him satisfaction inall which (with honour) he could request of her. Whereto Anastasioanswered, that he accepted her message thankfully, and desired noother favour at her hand, but that which stood with her owne offer,namely, to be his Wife in honourable marriage, The Maide knowingsufficiently, that he could not be more desirous of the match, thenher Mistresse shewed her selfe to be, made answer in her name, thatthis motion would be most welcome to her.

　　Heereupon, the Gentlewoman her selfe, became the solicitour to herFather and Mother, telling them plainly, that slie was willing to bethe Wife of Anastasio: which newes did so highly content them, thatupon the Sunday next following, the marriage was very worthilysolemnized, and they lived and loved together very kindly. Thus thedivine bounty out of the malignant enemies secret machinations, cancause good effects to arise and succeede. For, from this conceite offearfull imagination in her, not onely happened this long desiredconversion, of a Maide so obstinately scornfull and proud; butlikewise all the women of Ravenna (being admonished by her example)grew afterward more kind and tractable to mens honest motions, thenever they shewed themselves before. And let me make some use hereof(faire Ladies) to you, not to stand over-nicely conceited of yourbeauty and good parts, when men (growing enamored of you by them)solicite you with their best and humblest services. Remember then thisdisdainfull Gentlewoman, but more especially her, who being thedeath of so kinde a Lover, was therefore condemned to perpetuallpunishment, and he made the minister thereof, whom she had cast offwith coy disdaine, from which I wish your minds to be as free, as mineis ready to do you any acceptable service.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS FIGURED TO THE LIFE, THE NOTABLE KINDNESSE AND

　　COURTESIE, OF A TRUE AND CONSTANT LOVER: AS ALSO THE

　　MAGNANIMOUS MINDE OF A FAMOUS LADY

　　Frederigo, of the Alberighi Family, loved a Gentlewoman, and was notrequited with like love againe. By bountifull expences, and overliberall invitations, he wasted and consumed all his lands andgoods, having nothing left him, but a Hawke or Faulcon. His unkindeMistresse happeneth to come visite him, and he not having any otherfoode for her dinner; made a dainty dish of his Faulcone for her tofeede on. Being conquered by this exceeding kinde courtesie; shechanged her former hatred towardes him, accepting him as her Husbandin marriage, and made him a man of wealthy possessions.

　　Madam Philomena having finished her discourse, the Queeneperceiving, that her turne was the next, in regard of the priviledgegranted to Dioneus; with a smiling countenance thus she spake. Nowor never am I to maintaine the order which was instituted when weebegan this commendable exercise, whereto I yeeld with all humbleobedience. And (worthy Ladies) I am to acquaint you with a Novell,in some sort answerable to the precedent, not onely to let you know,how powerfully your kindnesses do prevalle, in such as have a free andgentle soule: but also to dvise you, in being bountifull, where vertuedoth justly challenge it. And evermore, let your favours shine onworthy deservers, without the direction of chaunce or Fortune, whonever bestoweth any gift by discretion; but rashly withoutconsideration, even to the first she blindly meets withall.

　　You are to understand then, that Coppo di Borghese Domenichi, whowas of our owne City, and perhaps (as yet) his name remaineth in greatand reverend authority, now in these dayes of ours, as welldeserving eternall memory; yet more for his vertues and commendablequalities, then any boast of Nobility from his predecessors. This man,being well entred into yeares, and drawing towards the finishing ofhis dayes; it was his only delight and felicity, in conversation amonghis neighbours, to talke of matters concerning antiquity, and someother things within compasse of his owne knowledge: which he woulddeliver in such singular order (having an absolute memory) and withthe best Language, as very few or none could do the like. Among themultiplicity of his queint discourses, I remember he told us, thatsometime there lived in Florence a yong Gentleman, named Frederigo,Sonne to Signior Phillippo Alberigo, who was held and reputed, bothfor Armes, and all other actions beseeming a Gentleman, hardly to havehis equall through all Tuscany.

　　This Frederigo (as it is no rare matter in yong Gentlemen) becameenamored of a Gentlewoman, named Madam Giana, who was esteemed (in hertime) to be the fairest and most gracious Lady in all Florence. Inwhich respect, and to reach the height of his desire, he made manysumptuous Feasts and Banquets, joustes, Tilties, Tournaments, andall other noble actions of Armes, beside, sending her infinite richand costly presents, making spare of nothing, but lashing all out inlavish expence. Notwithstanding, she being no lesse honest then faire,made no reckoning of whatsoever he did for her sake, or the leastrespect of his owne person. So that Frederigo, spending thus dailymore, then his meanes and ability could maintaine, and no supplies anyway redounding to him, or his faculties (as very easily they might)diminished in such sort, that became so poore; as he had nothingleft him, but a small poore Farme to live upon, the silly reveneweswhereof were so meane, as scarcely allowed him meat and drinke; yethad he a faire Hawke or Faulcon, hardly any where to be fellowed, soexpeditious and sure she was of flight. His low ebbe and poverty, noway quailing his love to the Lady, but rather setting a keener edgethereon; he saw the City life could no longer containe him, where mosthe coveted to abide: and therefore, betooke himselfe to his pooreCountrey Farme, to let his Faulcon get him his dinner and supper,patiently supporting his penurious estate, without suite or meanesmaking to one, for helpe or reliefe in any such necessity.

　　While thus he continued in this extremity, it came to passe, thatthe Husband to Madam Giana fell sicke, and his debility of bodybeing such, as little, or no hope of life remained: he made his lastwill and testament, ordaining thereby, that his Sonne (alreadygrowne to indifferent stature) should be heire to all his Lands andriches, wherein he abounded very greatly. Next unto him, if he chancedto die without a lawfull heire, he substituted his Wife, whom mostdearely he affected, and so departed out of this life. Madam Gianabeing thus left a widdow; as commonly it is the custome of our CityDames, during the Summer season, she went to a house of her owne inthe Countrey, which was somewhat neere to poore Frederigoes Farme, andwhere he lived in such an honest kind of contented poverty.

　　Hereupon, the young Gentleman her Sonne, taking great delight inHounds and Hawkes; grew into familiarity with poore Frederigo, andhaving seene many faire flights of his Faulcon, they pleased him soextraordinarily, that he earnestly desired to enjoy her as his owne;yet durst not move the motion for her, because he saw how choycelyFrederigo esteemed her. Within a short while after, the youngGentleman, became very sicke, whereat his Mother greevedexceedingly, (as having no more but he, and therefore loved him themore entirely) never parting from him night or day, comforting himso kindly as she could, and demanding, if he had a desire to anything, willing him to reveale it, and assuring him withall, that (itwere within the compasse of possibility) he should have it. Theyouth hearing how many times she had made him these offers, and withsuch vehement protestations of performance, at last thus spake.

　　Mother (quoth he) if you can do so much for me, as that I may haveFrederigoes Faulcon, I am perswaded, that my sicknesse soone willcease. The Lady hearing this, sate some short while musing to herselfe, and began to consider, what she might best doe to compasseher Sonnes desire: for well she knew, how long a time Frederigo hadmost lovingly kept it, not suffering it ever to be out of his sight.Moreover, shee remembred, how earnest in affection he had bene to her,never thinking himselfe happy, but onely when he was in her company;wherefore, shee entred into this private consultation with her ownethoughts. Shall I send, or goe my selfe in person, to request theFaulcon of him, it being the best that ever flew? It is his onelyJewell of delight, and that taken from him, no longer can he wish tolive in this World. How farre then voyde of understanding shall I shewmy selfe, to rob a Gentleman of his sole felicity, having no other joyor comfort left him? These and the like considerations, wheeledabout her troubled braine, onely in tender care and love to her Sonne,perswading her selfe assuredly, that the Faulcon were her owne, if shewould but request it: yet not knowing whereon it were best to resolve,shee returned no answer to her Sonne, but sate still in her silentmeditations. At the length, love to the youth, so prevailed withher, that she concluded on his contentation, and (come of it whatcould) shee would not send for it; but go her selfe in person torequest it, and then returne home againe with it: whereupon thus shespake. Sonne, comfort thy selfe, and let languishing thoughts nolonger offend thee: for here I promise thee, that the first thing I doto morrow morning, shall bee my journey for the Faulcon, and assurethy selfe, that I will bring it with me. Whereat the youth was sojoyed, that he imagined, his sicknesse began instantly a little toleave him, and promised him a speedy recovery.

　　Somewhat early the next morning, the Lady, in care of her sicke Sonshealth, was up and ready betimes, and taking another Gentlewomanwith her; onely as a morning recreation, shee walked to Frederigoespoore Countrey Farme, knowing that it would not a little glad him tosee her. At the time of her arrivall there, he was (by chance) in asilly Garden, on the backe-side of the a si House, because (as yet) itwas no convenient time for flight: but when he heard, that Madam Glanawas come thither, and desired to have some conference with him; as onealmost confounded with admiration, in all hast he ran to her, andsaluted her with most humble reverence. She in all modest and graciousmanner, requited him with the like salutations, thus speaking tohim. Signior Frederigo, your owne best wishes befriend you, I am nowcome hither, to recompence some part of your passed travailes, whichheretofore you pretended traval I to suffer for my sake, when yourlove was more to me, then did well become you to offer, or my selfe toaccept. And such is the nature of my recompence, that I make myselfe your guest, and meane this day to dine with as also thisGentlewoman, making no doubt of our welcome: whereto, with lowlyreverence, thus he replyed.

　　Madam, I doe not remember, that ever I sustained any losse orhinderance by you, but rather so much good, as if I was worth anything, it proceeded from your great deservings, and by the servicein which I did stand engaged to you. But my present happinesse canno way be equalled, derived from your super-abounding gracious favour,and more then common course of kindnesse, vouchsafing (of your owneliberall nature) to come and visit so poore a servant. Oh that I hadas much to spend againe, as heretofore riotously I have runnethorow: what a welcome would your poore Host bestow upon you, forgracing; this homely house with your divine presence? With thesewordes, he conducted her into his house, and then into his simpleGarden, where having no convenient company for her, he said. Madam,the poverty of this place is such, that it affoordeth none fit foryour conversation: this poore woman, wife to an honest Husbandman willattend on you, while I (with some speede) shall make ready dinner.

　　Poore Frederigo, although his necessity was extreame, and his greefegreat, remembring his former inordinate expences, a moity whereofwould now have stood him in some stead; yet he had a heart as free andforward as ever, not a jotte dejected in his minde, though utterlyoverthrowne by Fortune. Alas! how was his good soule afflicted, thathe had nothing wherewith to honour his Lady? Up and downe he runnes,one while this way, then againe another, exclaiming on hisdisastrous Fate, like a man enraged, or bereft of senses: for he hadnot one peny of mony neither pawne or pledge, wherewith to procureany. The time hasted on, and he would gladly (though in meane measure)expresse his honourable respect of the Lady. To begge of any, hisnature denied it, and to borrow he could not, because his neighbourswere all as needie as himselfe.

　　At last, looking round about, and seeing his Faulcon standing on herpearch, which he felt to be very plumpe and fat, being voyde of allother helpes in his neede, and thinking her to be a Fowle meete for soNoble a Lady to feede on: without any further demurring or delay, hepluckt off her necke, and caused the poore woman presently to pull herFeathers: which being done, he put her on the spit, and in shorttime she was daintily roasted. Himselfe covered the Table, set breadand salt on and laid the Napkins, whereof he had but a few left him.Going then with chearfull lookes into the Garden, telling the Ladythat dinner was ready, and nothing now wanted, but her presence. Shee,and the Gentlewoman went in, and being sated at the Table, not knowingwhat they fed on, the Faulcon was all their foode; and Frederigo not alittle joyfull, that his credite was so well saved. When they wererisen from the table, and had spent some small time in familiarconference: the Lady thought it fit, to acquaint him with the reasonof her comming thither, and therefore (in very kinde manner) thusbegan.

　　Frederigo, if you do yet remember your former carriage towardsmee, as also my many modest and chaste denials, which (perhaps) youthought to savour of a harsh, cruell, and un-womanly nature, I make nodoubt, but you will wonder at my present presumption, when youunderstand the occasion, which expressely mooved me to come hither.But if you were possessed of children, or ever had any, whereby youmight comprehend what love (in nature) is due unto them: then Idurst assure my selfe, that you would partly hold me excused.

　　Now, in regard that you never had any, and my selfe (for my part)have but onely one, I stand not exempted from those Lawes, which arein common to other mothers. And being compelled to obey the power ofthose Lawes; contrary to mine owne will, and those duties which reasonowne wi ought to maintaine, I am to request such a gift of you,which I am certaine, that you do make most precious account of, asin manly equity you can do no lesse. For Fortune hath bin so extreamlyadverse to you, that she hath robbed you of all other pleasures,allowing you no comfort or delight, but onely that poore one, which isyour faire Faulcone. Of which Bird, my Sonne is become so strangelydesirous, as, if I doe not bring it to him at my comming home; I feareso much, the extreamity of his sicknesse, as nothing can ensuethereon, but his losse of life. Wherefore I beseech you, not in regardof the love you have borne me, for therby you stand no way obliged:but in your owne true gentle nature (the which hath alwayes declaredit selfe ready in you, to do more kinde offices generally, then anyother Gentleman that I know) you will be pleased to give her me, or atthe least, let me buy her of you.

　　Which if you do, I shall freely then confesse, that onely by yourmeanes, my Sonnes life is saved, and we both shall for ever remaineengaged to you.

　　When Frederigo had heard the Ladies request, which was now quite outof his power to graunt, because it had bene her service at dinner:he stood like a man meerely dulled in his sences, the teares tricklingamaine downe his cheekes, and he not able to utter one word. Which sheperceiving, began to conjecture immediately, that these teares andpassions proceeded rather from greefe of minde, as being loather topart with his Faulcon, then any other kinde of manner: which madeher ready to say, that she would not have it. Neverthelesse she didnot speake, but rather tarried to attend his answer. Which, after somesmall respite and pause, he returned in this manner.

　　Madame, since the houre, when first mine affection became solydevoted to your service; Fortune hath bene crosse and contrary tome, in many occasions, as justly, and in good reason I may complain ofher, yet all seemed light and easie to be indured, in comparison ofher present malicious contradiction, to my utter overthrow, andperpetuall mollestation. Considering, that you are come hither to mypoore house, which (while I was rich and able) you would not so muchas vouchsafe to looke on. And now you have requested a small matter ofme, wherein she hath also most crookedly thwarted me, because she hathdisabled me, in bestowing so meane a gift, as your selfe willconfesse, when it shall be related to you in few words.

　　So soone as I heard, that it was your gracious pleasure to dine withme, having regard to your excellency, and what (by merit) is justlydue unto you: I thought it a part of my bounden duty, to entertaineyou with such exquisite viands, as my poore power could any waycompasse, and farre beyond respect or welcome, to other common andordinary persons. Whereupon, remembring my Faulcon, which now you askefor; and her goodnesse, excelling all other of her kinde; Isupposed, that she would make a dainty dish for your dyet, andhaving drest her, so well as I could devise to do: you have fedheartily on her, and I am proud that I have so well bestowne her.But perceiving now, that you would have her for your sicke Sonne; itis no meane affliction to me, that I am disabled of yeelding youcontentment, which all my life time I have desired to doe.

　　To approve his words, the feathers, feete, and beake were broughtin, which when she saw, she greatly blamed him for killing so rare aFaulcon, to content the appetite of any woman whatsoever. Yet shecommended his height of spirit, which poverty had no power to abase.Lastly, her hopes being frustrate for enjoying the Faulcon, andfearing besides the health of her Sonne, she thanked Frederigo for hishonorable kindnesse, returning home againe sad and melancholly.Shortly after, her sonne either greeving that he could not have theFaulcon, or by extreamity of his disease, chanced to dye, leavinghis mother a most wofull Lady.

　　After so much time was expired, as conveniently might agree withsorrow, and mourning; her Brethren made many motions to her, to oyneher selfe in marriage againe, because she was extraordinarily rich,and as yet but yong in yeares. Now although she was well contentednever to be married any more; yet being continually importuned bythem, and remembring the honorable honesty of Frederigo, his lastpoore, yet magnificent dinner, in killing his Faulcon for her sake,she saide to her Brethren. This kind of widdowed estate doth like meso well, as willingly I would never leave it: but seeing you are soearnest for my second marriage, let me plainly tell you, that I willnever accept of any other husband, but onely Frederigo di Alberino.

　　Her Brethren in scornefull manner reprooved her, telling her, thathe was a begger, and had nothing left to keepe him in the world. Iknow it well (quoth she) and am heartily sorry for it. But give me aman that hath neede of wealth, rather then wealth that hath neede of aman. The Brethren hearing how she stood addicted, and knowingFrederigo to be a worthy Gentleman, though poverty had disgraced himin the World: consented thereto, so she bestowed her selfe and herriches on him. He on the other side, having so noble a Lady to hisWife, and the same whom he had so long and deerely loved, submittedall his fairest Fortunes unto her, became a better husband (for theworld) then before, and they lived, and loved together in equall joyand happinesse.

　　THE FIFT DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　REPREHENDING THE CUNNING OF IMMODEST WOMEN, WHO BY ABUSING

　　THEMSELVES, DO THROW EVILL ASPERSIONS ON ALL THEIR SEXE

　　Pedro di Vinciolo went to sup at a friends house in the City. Hiswife (in the meane while) had a young man whom shee loved, at supperwith Pedro returning home on a sodaine, the young man was hidden undera Coope for Hens. Pedro in excuse of his so soone comming home,declareth, how in the house of Herculano (with whom he should havesupt) a friend of his Wives was found, which was the reason of theSuppers breaking off. Pedroes Wife reproving the error ofHerculanoes wife, an Asse (by chance) treads on the yong mansfingers that lay hidden under the Hen-coope. Upon his crying out Pedrosteppeth thither, sees him, knowes him, and findeth the fallacy of hiswife; with whom (nevertbelesse) he groweth to agreement, in regardof some imperfections in himselfe.

　　The Queenes Novell being ended, and all applauding the happy fortuneof Frederigo, as also the noble nature of Madam Giana; Dioneusexpecting no command, prepared to deliver his discourse in this maner.I know not whether I should terme it a vice accidentall, and insuingthorow the badnes of complexions on us mortals; or an error in Nature,to rejoyce rather at lewd accidents, then at deeds that deservecommendation, especially when they no way concern our selves. Now,in regard that all the paines I have hitherto taken, and am also toundergo at this present aymeth at no other end, but onely to purgeyour minds of melancholly, and entertain the time with mirthfulmatter: pardon me I pray you (faire Lacties) if my Tale trip in somepart, and savour a little of immodesty; yet in hearing it, you mayobserve the same course, as you doe in pleasing and delightfullGardens, plucke a sweete Rose, and preserve your fingers frompricking. Which very easily you may doe, winking at theimperfections of a foolish man, and at the amourous subtilties ofhis Wife, compassionating the misfortune of others, where urgentnecessity doth require it.

　　There dwelt not long since in Perugia, a wealthy man named Pedrodi Vinciolo, who perhaps more to deceive some other, and restrainean evill opinion which the Perugians had conceived of him, in matterno way beseeming a man, then any beauty or good feature remaining inthe woman entred into the estate of marriage. And Fortune was soconforme to him in his election, that the woman whom he had made hiswife, had a yong, lusty, and well enabled bodie, a red-haird Wench,hot and fiery spirited, standing more in neede of three Husbands, thenhe, who could not any way well content one Wife, because his minde ranmore on his mony, then those offices and duties belonging towedlock, which time acquainted his Wife withall, contrary to herowne expectation, and those delights which the estate of marriageafforded, knowing her selfe also to be of a sprightly disposition, andnot to be easily tamed by houshold cares and attendances, shee waxedweary of her husbands unkind courses, upbraided him daily with harshspeeches, making his owne home meerly as a hell to him.

　　When she saw that this domesticke disquietnesse returned her nobenefit, but rather tended to her own consumption, then anyamendment in her miserable Husband, shee began thus to conferre withher private thoughts. This Husband of mine liveth with me, as if hewere no Husband, or I his Wife; the marriage bed, which should be acomfort to us both, seemeth hatefull to him, and as little pleasing tomee, because his minde is on his money, his head busied with worldlycogitations, and early and late in his counting-house, admitting nofamiliar conversation with me. Why should not I be as respectlesseof him, as he declares him selfe to be of me? I tooke him for anHusband, brought him a good and sufficient Dowry, thinking him to beman, and affected a woman as a man ought to doe, else he had neverbeene any Husband of mine. If he be a Woman hater, why did he makechoice of me to be his Wife? If I had not intended to be of the World,I could have coopt my selfe up in a Cloyster, and shorne my selfe aNunne, but that I was not born to such severity of life. My youthshall be blasted with age before I can truly understand what youth is,and I shall be branded with the disgraceful word barrennesse,knowing my selfe meete and able to be a Mother, were my Husband butwort the name of a Father, or expected issue and posterity, to leaveour memoriall to after times in our race, as all our predecessoursformerly have done, and for which mariage was chiefly instituted.Castles long besieged, doe yeeld at the last, and women wronged bytheir owne husbands, can hardly warrant their owne frailety,especially living among so many temptations, which flesh and bloud arenot alwaies able to resist. Well, I meane to be advised in thiscase, before I will hazard my honest reputation, either to suspitionor scandall, then which, no woman can have two heavier enemies, andvery few there are that can escape them.

　　Having thus a long while consulted with her selfe, and (perhaps)oftner then twice or thrice; she became secretly acquainted with anaged woman, generally reputed to be more then halfe a Saint, walkingalwayes very demurely in the streetes, counting (over and over) herPaters Nosters, and all the Cities holy pardons hanging at hergirdle never talking of any thing, but the lives of the holyFathers, or the woundes of Saint Frances, all the World admiring hersanctity of life, even as if shee were divinely inspired: this sheeSaint must bee our distressed womans Counsellour, and having found outa convenient season, at large she imparted all her minde to her, insome such manner as formerly you have heard, whereto she returned thisanswer.

　　Now trust me Daughter, thy case is to be pittied, and so much therather, because thou art in the flowre and spring time of thy youth,when not a minute of time is to bee left: for there is no greater anerrour in this life, then the losse of time, because it cannot beerecovered againe; and when the fiends themselves affright us, yet ifwee keepe our embers still covered with warme ashes on the hearth,they have not any power to hurt us. If any one can truly speakethereof, then I am able to deliver true testimony; for I know, but notwithout much perturbation of minde, and piercing afflictions in thespirit; how much time I lost without any profit. And yet I lost notall, for I would not have thee thinke me to bee so foolish, that I didaltogether neglect such an especiall benefit; which when I call tomind, and consider now in what condition I am, thou must imagine, itis no small hearts griefe to mee, that age should make me utterlydespised, and no fire affoorded to light my tinder.

　　With men it is not so, they are borne apt for a thousandoccasions, as well for the present purpose wee talke of, as infiniteother beside; yea, and many of them are more esteemed being aged, thenwhen they were young. But women serve onely for mens contentation, andto bring Children; and therefore are they generally beloved, whichif they faile of, either it is by unfortunate marriage, or someimperfection depending on nature, not through want of good will inthemselves. Wee have nothing in this World but what is given us, inwhich regard, wee are to make use of our time, and employ it thebetter while wee have it. For, when wee grow to bee old, our Husbands,yea, our very dearest and nearest Friends, will scarsely looke onus. Wee are then fit for nothing, but to sit by the fire in theKitchin, telling tales to the Cat, or counting the Pots and Panneson the shelves. Nay, which is worse, Rimes and Songs is made of us,even in meere contempt of our age, and commendation of such as areyoung, the daintiest morsels are fittest for them, and wee referred tofeed on the scrappes from their Trenchers, or such reversion as theycan spare us. I tell thee Daughter, thou couldst not make choyce ofa meeter woman in all the City, to whom thou mightest safely openthy minde, and knowes better to advise thee then I doe. But rememberwithall, that I am poore, and it is your part not to suffer poverty tobee unsupplyed. I will make thee partaker of all these blessedpardons, at every Altar I will say a Pater Noster, and an Ave Maria,that thou maist prosper in thy hearts desires, and be defended fromfoule sinne and shame, and so she ended her Motherly counsell.

　　Within a while after, it came to passe, that her Husband was invitedfoorth to supper, with one named Herculano, a kinde Friend of his, buthis Wife refused to goe, because she had appointed a Friend toSupper with her, to whom the old woman was employed as hermessenger, and was well recompenced for her labour. This friend wasa gallant proper youth, as any all Perugia yeelded, and scarcely washee seated at the Table, but her Husband was returned backe, andcalled to bee let in at the doore. Which when shee perceived, shewas almost halfe dead with feare, and coveting to hide the youngman, that her Husband should not have any sight of him, shee had noother meanes, but in an entry, hard by the Parlour where they purposedto have supt, stood a Coope or Hen-pen, wherein shee used to keepe herPullen, under which hee crept, and then shee covered it with an oldeempty Sacke, and after ranne ranne to let her Husband come in. Whenhee was entred into the House; as halfe offended at his so suddenreturne, angerly she saide: It seemes Sir you are a shaver at yourmeate, that you have made so short a Supper. In troth Wife (quoth hee)I have not supt at all, no not so much as eaten one bit. How hapnedthat, said the woman? Marry Wife (quoth hee) I will tell you, and thenthus he began.

　　As Herculano, his Wife, and I were sitting downe at the Table,very neere unto us wee heard one sneeze, whereof at the first wee madeno reckoning, untill wee heard it againe the second time, yeal athird, fourth, and fifth, and many more after, whereat wee were nota little amazed. Now Wife I must tell you, before wee entred the roomewhere we were to sup, Herculanoes Wife kept the doore fast shutagainst us, and would not let us enter in an indifferent while;which made him then somewhat offended, but now much more, when hee hadheard one to sneeze so often. Demaunded of her a reason for it, andwho it was that thus sneezed in his House: hee started from the Table,and stepping to a little doore neere the staires head, necessarilymade, to set such things in, as otherwise would be troublesome tothe roome, (as in all Houses we commonly see the like) he perceived,that the party was hidden there, which wee had heard so often tosneeze before.

　　No sooner had hee opened the doore, but stich a smell of brimstonecame foorth (whereof wee felt not the least savour before) as madeus likewise to cough and sneeze, being no way able to refraine it.Shee seeing her Husband to bee much moved, excused the matter thus:that (but a little while before) shee had whited certaine linnenwith the smoake of brimstone, as it is a usuall thing to doe, and thenset the Pan into that spare place, because it should not bee offensiveto us. By this time, Herculano had espied him that sneezed, whobeing almost stifled with the smell, and closenesse of the small roomewherein hee lay, had not any power to helpe himselfe, but stillcontinued coughing and sneezing, even as if his heart would have splitin twaine. Foorth hee pluckt him by the heeles, and perceiving howmatter had past, hee saide to her. I thanke you Wife now I see thereason, why you kept us so long from comming into this roome: letmee die, if I beare this wrong at your hands. When his Wife heardthese words, and saw the discovery of her shame; without returningeither excuse or answere, foorth of doores shee ranne, but whither,wee know not. Herculano drew his Dagger, and would have slaine himthat still lay sneezing: but I disswaded him from it, as well inrespect of his, as also mine owne danger, when the Law shouldcensure on the deede. And after the young man was indifferentlyrecovered; by the perswasion of some Neighbours comming in: hee wasclosely conveyed out of the House, and all the noyse quietly pacified.Onely (by this meanes, and the flight of Herculanoes Wife) wee weredisappointed of our Supper, and now you know the reason of my so soonereturning.

　　When shee had heard this whole discourse, then shee perceived,that other Women were subject to the like infirmitie, and as wisefor themselves, as shee could be, though these the like sinisteraccidents might sometime crosse them: and gladly shee wished, thatHerculanoes Wives excuse, might now serve to acquite her: butbecause in blaming others errours, our owne may sometime chance toescape discovery, and cleare us, albeit wee are as guilty; in a sharpereprehending manner, thus shee began. See Husband, heere is hansomebehaviour, of an holy faire-seeming, and Saint-like woman, to whom Idurst have confest my sinnes, I conceived such a religiousperswasion of her lives integrety, free from the least scruple oftaxation. A woman, so farre stept into yeeres, as shee is, to givesuch an evill example to younger women, is it not a sinne beyond allsufferance? Accursed be the houre, when she was borne into this World,and her selfe likewise, to bee so lewdly and incontinently given; anuniversall shame and slaunder, to all the good women of our City.

　　Shall I tearme her a woman, or rather some savage monster in awomans shape? Hath shee not made an open prostitution of herhonesty, broken her plighted faith to her Husband, and all the womanlyreputation shee had in this World? Her Husband, being an honourableCitizen, entreating her alwayes, as few men else in the City doe theirwives; what an heart-breake must this needes bee to him, good man?Neither I, nor any honest man else, ought to have any pity on her, but(with our owne hands) teare her in peeces, or dragge her along to agood fire in the Market place, wherein she and her minion should beconsumed together, and their base ashes dispersed abroad in the winde,least the pure Aire should be infected with them.

　　Then, remembring her owne case, and her poore affrighted friend, wholay in such distresse under the Hen-coope; she began to advise herHusband, that he would be pleased to go to bed, because the nightpassed on apace. But Pedro, having a better will to eate, then tosleepe, desired her to let him have some meate, else hee must goe tobed with an empty bellie; whereto shee answered. Why Husband (quothshee) doe I make any large provision, when I am de. bard of yourcompany? I would I were the Wife of Herculano, seeing you cannotcontent your selfe from one nights feeding, considering, it is nowover-late to make any thing ready.

　　It fortuned; that certaine Husbandmen, which had the charge ofPedroes Farmehouse in the Countrey, and there followed his affaires ofHusbandry, were returned home this instant night, having their Assesladen with such provision, as was to bee used in his City-house.When the Asses were unladen, and set up in a small Stable, withoutwatering; one off them being (belike) more thirsty then the rest,brake loose, and wandering all about smelling to seeke water, happenedinto the entry, where the young man lay hidden under the Hen pen. Now,hee being constrained (like a Carpe) to lye flat on his belly, becausethe Coope was over-weighty for him to carry, and one of his hands moreextended foorth, then was requisite for him in so urgent a shift: itwas his hap (or ill fortune rather) that the Asse set his foote on theyoung mans fingers, treading so hard, and the paine being veryirkesome to him, as hee was enforced to cry out aloude: which Pedrohearing, he wondered thereat not a little.

　　Knowing that this cry was in his house, hee tooke the Candle inhis hand, and going foorth of the Parlour, heard the cry to be louder;because the Asse removed not his foote, but rather trod the morefirmely on his hand. Comming to the Coope, driving the Asse, andtaking off the old sacke, he espyed the young man, who, beside thepainefull anguish he felt of his fingers, arose up trembling, asfearing some outrage beside to bee offered him by Pedro, who knewthe youth perfectly, and demaunded of him, how he came thither. Noanswere did hee make to that question, but humbly entreated (forcharities sake) that hee would not doe him any harme. Feare not (quothPedro) I will not offer thee any violence: onely tell mee how thoucamest hither, and for what occasion; wherein the youth fully resolvedhim.

　　Pedro being no lesse joyfull for thus find. him, then his Wife wassorrowfull, tooke him by the hand, and brought him into the Parlour,where shee sate trembling and quaking, as not knowing what to say inthis distresse. Seating himselfe directly before her, and holdingthe youth still fast by the hand, thus hee began. Oh Wife! What bitterspeeches did you use (even now) against the Wife of Herculano,maintaining that shee had shamed all other women, and justlydeserved to be burned? Why did you not say as much of your selfe?Or, if you had not the heart to speake, how could you bee so cruellagainst her, knowing your offence as great as hers? Questionlesse,nothing else urged you thereto, but that all women are of one andthe same condition, covering their owne grosse faults by farreinferiour infirmities in others. You are a perverse generation,meerely false in your fairest shewes.

　　When she saw that he offered her no other violence, but gave hersuch vaunting and reproachfull speeches, holding still the young manbefore her face, meerely vexe and despight her: shee began to takeheart, and thus replied. Doest thou compare mee with the Wife ofHerculano, who is an old, dissembling hypocrite? Yet she can have ofhim whatsoever shee desireth, and he useth her as a woman ought to be,which favour I could never yet finde at thy hands. Put the case,that thou keepest me in good garments; allowing mee to goe neatlyhosed and shod; yet well thou knowest, there are other meere mattersbelonging to a woman, and every way as necessarily required, bothfor the preservation of Houshold quietnesse, and those other ritesbetweene a Husband and Wife. Let mee be worser garmented, courserdieted, yea, debarred of all pleasure and delights; so I might once beworthy the name of a Mother, and leave some remembrance ofwoman-hood behinde me. I tell thee plainely Pedro, I am a woman asothers are, and subject to the same desires, as (by nature)attendeth on flesh and blood: looke how thou failest in kindnessetowards me, thinke it not amisse, if I doe the like to thee, andendeavour thou to win the worthy title of a Father, because I was madeto be a Mother.

　　When Pedro perceived, that his Wife had spoken nothing but reason,in regard of his over-much neglect towards her, and not using suchHoushold kindnesse, as ought to be betweene Man and Wife, hee returnedher this answer. Well Wife (quoth he) I confesse my fault, andhereafter will labour to amend it; conditionally, that this youth, norany other, may no more visite my House in my absence. Get me thereforesomething to eate, for doubtlesse, this young man and thy selfe fellshort of your Supper, by reason of my so soone returning home. Introth Husband, saide she, we did not eate one bit of any thing, andI will be a true and loyall Wife to thee, so thou wilt be the liketo me. No more words then Wife, replyed Pedro, all is forgotten andforgiven, let us to Supper, and we are all friends. She seeing hisanger was so well appeased, lovingly kissed him, and laying the cloth,set on the supper, which she had provided for her selfe and the youth,and so they supt together merrily, not one unkinde word passingbetweene them. After Supper, the youth was sent away in friendlymanner, and Pedro was alwayes afterward more loving to his Wife,then formerly hee had beene, and no complaint passed on either side,but mutuall joy and Houshold contentment, such as ought to beebetweene Man and Wife.

　　Dioneus having ended this his Tale, for which the Ladies returnedhim no thankes, but rather angerly frowned on him: the Queene, knowingthat her government was now concluded, arose, and taking off herCrowne of Lawrell, placed it graciously on the head of Madame Eliza,saying. Now Madame, it is your turne to commaund. Eliza havingreceived the honour, did (in all respects) as others formerly haddone, and after shee had enstructed the Master of the Houshold,concerning his charge during the time of her Regiment, forcontentation of all the company; thus shee spake.

　　We have long since heard, that with witty words, ready answeresand sudden jests or taunts, many have checkt and reproved greatfolly in others, and to their no meane owne commendation. Now, becauseit is a pleasing kinde of argument, ministring occasion of mirth andwit: my desire is, that all our discourse to morrow shall tendthereto. I meane of such persons, either Men or Women, who with somesudden witty answere, have encountred a scorner in his owne intention,and layed the blame where it justly belonged. Every one commendedthe Queenes appointment, because it savoured of good wit andjudgement; and the Queene being risen, they were all discharged tillsupper time, falling to such severall exercises as themselves bestfancyed.

　　When Supper was ended, and the instruments layed before them; by theQueenes consent, Madam Aemilia undertooke the daunce, and the Song wasappointed to Dioneus, who began many, but none that proved to anyliking, they were so palpably obsceene and idle, savouringaltogether of his owne wanton disposition. At the length, the Queenelooking stearnely on him, and commanding him to sing a good one, ornone at all; thus he began.

　　THE SONG

　　Eyes, can ye not refraine your hourely weeping?

　　Eares, how are you depriv'd of sweete attention?

　　Thoughts, have you lost your quiet silent sleeping.

　　Wit, who hath rob'd thee of thy rare invention?

　　The lacke of these, being life and motion giving:

　　Are senselesse shapes, and no true signes of living.

　　Eyes, when you gaz'd upon her Angell beauty;

　　Eares, while you heard her sweete delitious straines,

　　Thoughts (sleeping then) did yet performe their duty,

　　Wit, tooke sprightly pleasure in his paines.

　　While shee did live, then none of these were scanting,

　　But now (being dead) they all are gone, and wanting.

　　After that Dioneus (by proceeding no further) declared the finishingof his Song; many more were sung beside, and that of Dioneus highlycommended. Some part of the night being spent in other delightfullexercises, and a fitting houre for rest drawing on: they betookethemselves to their Chambers, where we will leave them till tomorrow morning.

　　THE INDUCTION TO THE SIXT DAY

　　GOVERNED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF MADAM ELIZA, AND THE ARGUMENT

　　OF THE DISCOURSES OR NOVELLS THERE TO BE RECOUNTED, DOE CONCERNE

　　SUDDEN, PERSONS; WHO BY SOME WITTY WORDS (WHEN ANY HAVE CHECKT OR

　　RETORTING THEM) HAVE REVENGED THEMSELVES, IN A SUDDEN, UNEXPECTED

　　AND DISCREET ANSWERE, THEREBY PREVENTING LOSSE, DANGER, SCORNE

　　AND DISGRACE, RETORTING THEM ON THE BUSI-HEADED QUESTIONERS

　　The Moone having past the heaven, lost her bright splendor, by thearising of a more powerfull light, and every part of our world beganto looke cleare: when the Queene (being risen) caused all theCompany to be called, walking forth afterward upon the pearled dewe(so farre as was supposed convenient) in faire and familiar conferencetogether, according as severally they were disposed, and repetition ofdivers the passed Novels, especially those which were most pleasing,and seemed so by their present commendations. But the Sunne beeingsomewhat higher mounted, gave such a sensible warmth to the ayre, ascaused their returne backe to the Pallace, where the Tables werereadily covered against their comming, strewed with sweete hearbes andodoriferous flowers, seating themselves at the Tables (before the heatgrew more violent) according as the Queene commanded.

　　After dinner, they sung divers excellent Canzonnets, and then somewent to sleepe, others played at the Chesse, and some at the Tables:But Dioneus and Madam Lauretta, they sung the love-conflict betweeneTroylus and Cressida. Now was the houre come, of repairing to theirformer Consistory or meeting place, the Queene having theretogenerally summoned them, and seating themselves (as they were wontto doe) about the faire fountaine. As the Queene was commanding tobegin the first Novell, an accident suddenly happened, which never hadbefalne before: to wit, they heard a great noyse and tumult, among thehoushold servants in the Kitchin. Whereupon, the Queene caused theMaster of the Houshold to be called, demaunding of him, what noyseit was, and what might be the occasion thereof? He made answere,that Lacisca and Tindaro were at some words of discontentment, butwhat was the occasion thereof, he knew not. Whereupon, the Queenecommanded that they should be sent for, (their anger and violentspeeches still continuing) and being come into her presence, shedemaunded the reason of their discord; and Tindaro offering to makeanswere, Lacisca (being somewhat more ancient then he, and of afiercer fiery spirit, even as if her heart would have leapt out of hermouth) turned her selfe to him, and with a scornefull frowningcountenance, said. See how this bold, unmannerly and beastly fellow,dare presume to speake in this place before me: Stand by (saucyimpudence) and give your better leave to answere; then turning tothe Queene, thus shee proceeded.

　　Madam, this idle fellow would maintaine to me, that SigniorSicophanto marrying with Madama della Grazza, had the victory of hervirginity the very first night; and I avouched the contrary, becauseshee had been a mother twise before, in very faire adventuring ofher fortune. And he dared to affirme beside, that yong Maides are sosimple, as to loose the flourishing Aprill of their time, in meerefeare of their parents, and great prejudice of their friends.

　　And then the Queene, somewhat offended at the folly of the formercontroversie, commanded Madame Philomena, that she should givebeginning to the dayes Novels: which (in dutifull manner) sheeundertooke to doe, and seating her selfe in formall fashion, withmodest and very gracious gesture, thus she began.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　REPREHENDING THE FOLLY OF SUCH MEN, AS UNDERTAKE TO REPORT

　　DISCOURSES, WHICH ARE BEYOND THEIR WIT AND CAPACITY, AND

　　GAINE NOTHING BUT BLAME FOR THEIR LABOUR

　　A Knight requested Madam Oretta, to ride behinde him on horse-backe,and promised, to tell her an excellent Tale by the way. But the Ladyperceiving, that his discourse was idle, and much worse delivered:entreated him to let her walke on foote againe.

　　Gracious Ladies, like as in our faire, cleere, and serene seasons,the Starres are bright ornaments to the heavens, and the flowry fields(so long as the spring time lasteth) weare their goodliest Liveries,the Trees likewise bragging in their best adornings: Even so atfriendly meetings, short, sweet, and sententious words, are the beautyand ornament of any discourse, savouring of wit and sound judgement,worthily deserving to be commended. And so much the rather, because infew and witty words, aptly suting with the time and occasion, moreis delivered then was expected, or sooner answered, then rashlyapprehended: which, as they become men verie highly, yet do theyshew more singular in women.

　　True it is, what the occasion may be, I know not, either by thebadnesse of our wittes, or the especiall enmitie betweene ourcomplexions and the celestiall bodies: there are scarsely any, or veryfew Women to be found among us, that well knowes how to deliver aword, when it should and ought to be spoken; or, if a question beemooved, understands to suite it with an apt answere, such asconveniently is required, which is no meane disgrace to us women.But in regard, that Madame Pampinea hath already spoken sufficientlyof this matter, I meane not to presse it any further: but at this timeit shall satisfie mee, to let you know, how wittily a Ladie made dueobservation of opportunitie, in answering of a Knight, whose talkeseemed tedious and offensive to her.

　　No doubt there are some among you, who either do know, or (at theleast) have heard, that it is no long time since, when there dwelt aGentlewoman in our Citie, of excellent grace and good discourse,with all other rich endowments of Nature remaining in her, as pitty itwere to conceale her name: and therefore let me tell ye, that shee wascalled Madame Oretta, the Wife to Signior Geri Spina. She being uponsome occasion (as now we are) in the Countrey, and passing fromplace to place (by way of neighbourly invitations) to visite herloving Friends and Acquaintance, accompanied with divers Knights andGentlewomen, who on the day before had dined and supt at her house, asnow (belike) the selfe-same courtesie was intended to her: walkingalong with her company upon the way; and the place for her welcomebeeing further off then she expected; a Knight chanced to overtakethis faire troop, who well knowing Madam Oretta, using a kinde andcourteous salutation, spake thus.

　　Madam, this foot travell may bee offensive to you, and were you sowell pleased as my selfe, I would ease your journey behinde mee onmy Gelding, even so as you shall command me: and beside, wil shortenyour wearinesse with a Tale worth the hearing. Courteous Sir(replyed the Lady) I embrace your kinde offer with such acceptation,that I pray you to performe it; for therein you shall doe me anespeciall favour. The Knight, whose Sword (perhappes) was asunsuteable to his side, as his wit out of fashion for any readiediscourse, having the Lady mounted behinde him rode on with a gentlepace, and (according to his promise) began to tell a Tale, whichindeede (of it selfe) deserved attention, because it was a knowneand commendable History, but yet delivered so abruptly, with idlerepetitions of some particulars three or foure severall times,mistaking one thing for another, and wandering erroneously from theessentiall subject, seeming neere an end, and then beginning againe:that a poore Tale could not possibly be more mangled, or worsetortured in telling, then this was; for the persons therein concerned,were so abusively nicke-named, their actions and speeches somonstrously mishapen, that nothing could appeare to be more ugly.

　　Madame Oretta, being a Lady of unequalled ingenuitie, admirable injudgement, and most delicate in her speech, was afflicted in soule,beyond all measure; overcome with many colde sweates, and passionateheart-aking qualmes, to see a Foole thus in a Pinne-fold, and unableto get out, albeit the doore stood wide open to him, whereby sheebecame so sicke; that, converting her distaste to a kinde ofpleasing acceptation, merrily thus she spake. Beleeve me Sir, yourhorse trots so hard, and travels so uneasily; that I entreate you tolet me walke on foot againe.

　　The Knight, being (perchance) a better understander, then aDiscourser; perceived by this witty taunt, that his Bowle had run acontrarie bias, and he as farre out of Tune, as he was from the Towne.So, lingering the time, untill her company was neerer arrived: heelefte her with them, and rode on as his Wisedome could best directhim.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　APPROVING, THAT A REQUEST OUGHT TO BE CIVILL, BEFORE IT

　　SHOULD BE GRANTED TO ANY ONE WHATSOEVER

　　Cistio a Baker, by a wittie answer which he gave unto Messer GeriSpina, caused him to acknowledge a very indiscreete motion, which hehad made to the said Cistio.

　　The words of Madame Oretta, were much commended by the men andwomen; and the discourse being ended, the Queene gave command to MadamPampinea, that shee should follow next in order, which made her tobegin in this manner.

　　Worthy Ladies, it exceedeth the power of my capacitie, to censure inthe case whereof I am to speake, by saying, who sinned most, eitherNature, in seating a Noble soule in a vile body, or Fortune, inbestowing on a body (beautified with a noble soule) a base or wretchedcondition of life. As we may observe by Cistio, a Citizen of our owne,and many more beside; for, this Cistio beeing endued with a singulargood spirit, Fortune hath made him no better then a Baker. And beleeveme Ladies, I could (in this case) lay as much blame on Nature, as onFortune; if I did not know Nature to be most absolutely wise, and thatFortune hath a thousand eyes, albeit fooles have figured her to beeblinde. But, upon more mature and deliberate consideration, I finde,that they both (being truly wise and judicious) have dealt justly,in imitation of our best advised mortals, who being uncertaine of suchinconveniences, as may happen unto them, do bury (for their ownbenefit) the very best and choicest things of esteeme, in the mostvile and abject places of their houses, as being subject to leastsuspition, and where they may be sure to have them at all times, forsupply of any necessitie whatsoever, because so base a conveyance hathbetter kept them, then the very best chamber in the house could havedone. Even so these two great commanders of the world, do many timeshide their most precious Jewels of worth, under the clouds of Artsor professions of worst estimation, to the end, that fetching themthence when neede requires, their splendor may appeare to be themore glorious. Nor was any such matter noted in our homely BakerCistio, by the best observation of Messer Geri Spina, who was spokenof in the late repeated Novell, as being the husband to Madame Oretta;whereby this accident came to my remembrance, and which (in a shortTale) I will relate unto you.

　　Let me then tell ye, that Pope Boniface (with whom the fore-namedMesser Geri Spina was in great regard) having sent divers Gentlemen ofhis Court to Florence as Ambassadors, about very serious and importantbusinesse: they were lodged in the house of Messer Geri Spina, andhe employed (with them) in the saide Popes negotiation. It chanced,that as being the most convenient way for passage, every morningthey walked on foot by the Church of Saint Marie d'Ughi, whereCistio the Baker dwelt, and exercised the trade belonging to him.Now although Fortune had humbled him to so meane a condition, yet sheeadded a blessing of wealth to that contemptible quality, and (assmiling on him continually) no disasters at any time befell him, butstill he flourished in riches, lived like a jolly Citizen, with allthings fitting for honest entertainment about him, and plenty of thebest Wines (both White and Claret) as Florence, or any part thereaboutyeelded.

　　Our frolicke Baker perceiving, that Messer Geri Spina and theother Ambassadors, used every morning to passe by his doore, andafterward to returne backe the same way: seeing the season to besomewhat hot and soultry, he tooke it as an action of kindnesse andcourtesie, to make them an offer of tasting his white wine. But havingrespect to his owne meane degree, and the condition of Messer Geri:hee thought it farre unfitting for him, to be so forward in suchpresumption; but rather entred into consideration of some such meanes,whereby Messer Geri might bee the inviter of himselfe to taste hisWine. And having put on him a trusse or thin doublet, of very whiteand fine Linnen cloath, as also breeches, and an apron of the same,and a white cap upon his head, so that he seemed rather to be aMiller, then a Baker: at such times as Messer Geri and the Ambassadorsshould daily passe by, hee set before his doore a new Bucket offaire water, and another small vessell of Bologna earth (as new andsightly as the other) full of his best and choisest white Wine, withtwo small Glasses, looking like silver, they were so cleare. Downehe sate, with all this provision before him, and emptying his stomacketwice or thrice, of some clotted flegmes which seemed to offend it:even as the Gentlemen were passing by, he dranke one or two rousesof his Wine so heartily, and with such a pleasing appetite, as mighthave moved a longing (almost) in a dead man.

　　Messer Geri well noting his behaviour, and observing the veriesame course in him two mornings together; on the third day (as hewas drinking) he said unto him. Well done Cistio, what, is it good, orno? Cistio starting up, forthwith replyed; Yes Sir, the wine is goodindeed, but how can I make you to beleeve me, except you taste ofit? Messer Geri, eyther in regard of the times quality, or by reasonof his paines taken, perhaps more then ordinary, or else, becausehee saw Cistio had drunke so sprightly, was very desirous to tasteof the Wine, and turning unto the Ambassadors, in merriment hesaide. My Lords, me thinks it were not much amisse, if we tooke ataste of this honest mans Wine, perhaps it is so good, that we shallnot neede to repent our labour.

　　Heereupon, he went with them to Cistio, who had caused an handsomeseate to be fetched forth of his house, whereon he requested them tosit downe, and having commanded his men to wash cleane the Glasses, hesaide. Fellowes, now get you gone, and leave me to the performanceof this service; for I am no worse a skinker, then a Baker, andtarry you never so long, you shall not drinke a drop. Having thusspoken, himselfe washed foure or five small glasses, faire and new,and causing a Viall of his best wine to be brought him: hee diligentlyfilled it out to Messer Geri and the Ambassadours, to whom it seemedthe very best Wine, that they had drunke of in a long while before.And having given Cistio most hearty thankes for his kindnesse, and theWine his due commendation: many dayes afterwardes (so long as theycontinued there) they found the like courteous entertainment, and withthe good liking of honest Cistio.

　　But when the affayres were fully concluded, for which they werthus sent to Florence, and their parting preparation in duereadinesse: Messer Geri made a very sumptuous Feast for them, invitingthereto the most part of the honourablest Citizens, and Cistio to beone amongst them; who (by no meanes) would bee seene in an assembly ofsuch State and pompe, albeit he was thereto (by the saide Messer Geri)most earnestly entreated.

　　In regard of which deniall, Messer Geri commaunded one of hisservants, to take a small Bottle, and request Cistio to fill it withhis good Wine; then afterward, to serve it in such sparing manner tothe Table, that each Gentleman might be allowed halfe a glasse-full attheir down-sitting. The Serving-man, who had heard great report of theWine, and was halfe offended because he could never taste thereof:tooke a great Flaggon Bottle, containing foure or five Gallons atthe least, and comming there-with unto Cistio, saide unto him. Cistio,because my Master cannot have your companie among his friends, heprayes you to fill this Bottle with your best Wine. Cistio lookinguppon the huge Flaggon, replyed thus. Honest Fellow, Messer Geri neversent thee with such a Message to me: which although the Serving-manvery stoutly maintained, yet getting no other answer, he returnedbacke therwith to his Master.

　　Messer Geri returned the Servant backe againe unto Cistio, saying:Goe, and assure Cistio, that I sent thee to him, and if hee makethee any more such answeres, then demaund of him, to what place else Ishould send thee? Being come againe to Cistio, hee avouched that hisMaister had sent him, but Cistio affirming, that hee did not: theServant asked, to what place else hee should send him? Marrie (quothCistio) unto the River of Arno, which runneth by Florence, therethou mayest be sure to fill thy Flaggon. When the Servant had reportedthis answer to Messer Geri, the eyes of his understanding beganne toopen, and calling to see what Bottle hee had carried with him: nosooner looked he on the huge Flaggon, but severely reproving thesawcinesse of his Servant, hee sayde. Now trust mee, Cistio toldthee nothing but trueth, for neither did I send thee with any suchdishonest message, nor had the reason to yeeld or grant it.

　　Then he sent him with a bottle of more reasonable competencie, whichso soone as Cistio saw: Yea mary my friend, quoth he, now I am surethat thy Master sent thee to me, and he shall have his desire with allmy hart. So, commaunding the Bottle to be filled, he sent it away bythe Servant, and presently following after him, when he came untoMesser Geri, he spake unto him after this maner. Sir, I would not haveyou to imagine, that the huge flaggon (which first came) did any jottedismay mee; but rather I conceyved, that the small Viall whereof youtasted every morning, yet filled many mannerly Glasses together, wasfallen quite out of your remembrance; in plainer tearmes, it beeing noWine for Groomes or Peazants, as your selfe affirmed yesterday. Andbecause I meane to bee a Skinker no longer, by keeping Wine toplease any other pallate but mine owne: I have sent you halfe mystore, and heereafter thinke of mee as you shall please. Messer Geritooke both his guifte and speeches in most thankefull manner,accepting him alwayes after, as his intimate Friend, because he had sograced him before the Ambassadours.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THAT MOCKERS DO SOMETIMES MEETE WITH

　　THEIR MATCHES IN MOCKERY, AND TO THEIR OWNE SHAME

　　Madame Nonna de Pulci, by a sodaine answere, did put to silence aByshop of Florence, and the Lord Marshall: having moved a questionto the said Lady, which seemed to come short of honesty.

　　When Madame Pampinea had ended her Discourse, and (by the wholecompany) the answere and bounty of Cistio, had past with deservedcommendation: it pleased the Queene, that Madame Lauretta shouldnext succeed: whereupon verie chearefully thus she beganne.

　　Faire assembly, Madame Pampinea (not long time since) gavebeginning, and Madam Philomena hath also seconded the same argument,concerning the slender vertue remaining in our sexe, and likewisethe beautie of wittie words, delivered on apt occasion, and inconvenient meetings. Now, because it is needlesse to proceede anyfurther, then what hath beene already spoken: let mee onely tell you(over and beside) and commit it to memorie, that the nature ofmeetings and speeches are such, as they ought to nippe or touch thehearer, like unto the Sheepes nibling on the tender grasse, and not asthe sullen Dogge byteth. For, if their biting be answereable to theDogges, they deserve not to be termed witty jests or quips, butfoule and offensive language: as plainly appeareth by the words ofMadame Oretta, and the mery, yet sensible answer of Cistio.

　　True it is, that if it be spoken by way of answer, and theanswerer biteth doggedly, because himselfe was bitten in the samemanner before: he is the lesse to bee blamed, because hee makethpayment but with coine of the same stampe. In which respect, anespeciall care is to bee had, how, when, with whom, and where wejest or gibe, whereof very many proove too unmindfull, as appeared(not long since) by a Prelate of ours, who met with a byting, no lessesharpe and bitter, then had first come from himselfe before, asverie briefely I intend to tell you how.

　　Messer Antonio d'Orso, being Byshoppe of Florence, a vertuous, wise,and reverend Prelate; it fortuned that a Gentleman of Catalogna, namedMesser Diego de la Ratta, and Lord Marshall to King Robert ofNaples, came thither to visite him. Hee being a man of very comelypersonage, and a great observer of the choysest beauties in Court:among all the other Florentine Dames, one proved to bee mostpleasing in his eye, who was a verie faire Woman indeede, and Neece tothe Brother of the saide Messer Antonio.

　　The Husband of this Gentlewoman (albeit descended of a worthieFamily) was, neverthelesse, immeasurably covetous, and a verie harshnatured man. Which the Lord Marshall understanding, made such amadde composition with him, as to give him five hundred Ducates ofGold, on condition, that hee would let him lye one night with hiswife, not thinking him so base minded as to give consent. Which in agreedy avaritious humour he did, and the bargaine being absolutelyagreed on; the Lord Marshall prepared to fit him with a payment,such as it should be. He caused so many peeces of silver to becunningly guilded, as then went for currant mony in Florence, andcalled Popolines, and after he had lyen with the Lady (contrary to herwill and knowledge, her husband had so closely carried thebusinesse) the money was duely paid to the cornuted Coxcombe.Afterwards, this impudent shame chanced to be generally knowne,nothing remaining to the wilful Wittoll, but losse of his expectedgaine, and scorne in every place where he went. The Bishop likewise(beeing a discreete and sober man) would seeme to take no knowledgethereof; but bare out all scoffes with a well setled countenance.

　　Within a short while after, the Bishop and the Lord Marshal (alwaiesconversing together) it came to passe, that upon Saint johns day, theyriding thorow the City, side by side, and viewing the bravebeauties, which of them might best deserve to win the prize: theByshop espied a yong married Lady (which our late greevouspestilence bereaved us of) she being named Madame Nonna de Pulci,and Cousine to Messer Alexio Rinucci, a Gentleman well knowne untous all. A very goodly beautifull yong woman she was, of delicatelanguage, and singular spirite, dwelling close by S. Peters gate. ThisLady did the Bishop shew to the Marshall, and when they were come toher, laying his hand uppon her shoulder, he said. Madam Nonna, Whatthinke you of this Gallant? Dare you adventure another wager with him?

　　Such was the apprehension of this witty Lady, that these wordsseemed to taxe her honour, or else to contaminate the hearersunderstanding, whereof there were great plenty about her, whosejudgement might be as vile, as the speeches were scandalous.Wherefore, never seeking for any further purgation of her cleareconscience, but onely to retort taunt for taunt, presently thus shereplied. My Lord, if I should make such a vile adventure, I wouldlooke to bee payde with better money.

　　These words being heard both by the Bishop and Marshall, they feltthemselves touched to the quicke, the one, as the Factor or Broker,for so dishonest a businesse, to the Brother of the Bishop; and theother, as receiving (in his owne person) the shame belonging to hisBrother. So, not so much as looking each on other, or speaking oneword together all the rest of that day, they rode away with blushingcheekes. Whereby we may collect, that the yong Lady, being soinjuriously provoked, did no more then well became her, to bitetheir basenesse neerely, that so abused her openly.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　WHEREBY PLAINLY APPEARETH, THAT A SODAINE WITTY AND MERRY ANSWER,

　　DOTH OFTENTIMES APPEASE THE FURIOUS CHOLLER OF AN

　　ANGRY MAN

　　Chichibio, the Cooke to Messer Currado Gianfiliazzi, by a sodainepleasant answer which he made to his Master; converted his angerinto laughter, and thereby escaped the punishment, that Messer meantto impose on him.

　　Madam Lauretta sitting silent, and the answer of Lady Nonna havingpast with generall applause: the Queene commanded Madame Neiphila tofollow next in order; who instantly thus began. Although a ready wit(faire Ladies) doth many times affoord worthy and commendablespeeches, according to the accidents happening to the speaker: yetnotwithstanding, Fortune (being a ready helper divers wayes to thetimorous) doth often tippe the tongue with such a present reply, asthe partie to speake, had not so much leysure as to thinke on, nor yetto invent; as I purpose to let you perceive, by a prety short Novell.

　　Messer Currado Gianfiliazzi (as most of you have both seene andknowen) living alwayes in our Citie, in the estate of a Noble Citizen,beeing a man bountifull, magnificent, and within the degree ofKnighthoode: continually kept both Hawkes and Hounds, taking nomeane delight in such pleasures as they yeelded, neglecting (for them)farre more serious imployments, wherewith our present subjectpresumeth not to meddle. Upon a day, having kilde with his Faulcon aCrane, neere to a Village called Peretola, and finding her to beboth young and fat, he sent it to his Cooke, a Venetian borne, andnamed Chichibio, with command to have it prepared for his supper.Chichibio, who resembled no other, then (as he was indeede) aplaine, simple, honest mery fellow, having drest the Crane as it oughtto bee, put it on the spit, and laide it to the fire.

　　When it was well neere fully roasted, and gave forth a very delicatepleasing savour; it fortuned that a young Woman dwelling not faroff, named Brunetta, and of whom Chichibio was somewhat enamored,entred into the Kitchin, and feeling the excellent smell of the Crane,to please her beyond all savours, that ever she had felt before: sheentreated Chichibio verie earnestly, that hee would bestow a leggethereof on her. Whereto Chichibio (like a pleasant companion, andevermore delighting in singing) sung her this answer.

　　My Brunetta, faire and feat a,

　　Why should you say so?

　　The meate of my Master,

　　Allowes you for no Taster,

　　Go from the Kitchin go.

　　Many other speeches past betweene them in a short while, but inthe end, Chichibio, because hee would not have his MistresseBrunetta angrie with him; cut away one of the Cranes legges from thespit, and gave it to her to eate. Afterward, when the Fowle was servedup to the Table before Messer Currado, who had invited certainstrangers his friends to sup with him, wondering not a little, hecalled for Chichibio his Cook; demanding what was become of the Cranesother legge? Whereto the Venetian (being a lyar by Nature) sodainelyanswered: Sir, Cranes have no more but one legge each Bird. MesserCurrado, growing verie angry, replyed. Wilt thou tell me, that a Cranehath no more but one legge? Did I never see a Crane before this?Chichibio persisting resolutely in his deniall, saide. Beleeve me Sir,I have told you nothing but the truth, and when you please, I wil makegood my wordes, by such Fowles as are living.

　　Messer Currado, in kinde love to the strangers that hee hadinvited to supper, gave over any further contestation; onely hesaid. Seeing thou assurest me, to let me see thy affirmation fortruth, by other of the same Fowles living (a thing which as yet Inever saw, or heard of) I am content to make proofe thereof tomorrow morning, till then I shall rest satisfied: but, upon my word,if I finde it otherwise, expect such a sound payment, as thy knaveryjustly deserveth, to make thee remember it all thy life time. Thecontention ceassing for the night season, Messer Currado, who thoughhe had slept well, remained still discontented in his minde: arosein the morning by breake of day, and puffing and blowing angerly,called for his horses, commanding Chichibio to mount on one of them;so riding on towards the River, where (earely every morning) he hadseene plenty of Cranes, he sayde to his man; We shall see anonSirra, whether thou or I lyed yesternight.

　　Chichibio perceiving, that his Masters anger was not (as yet)asswaged, and now it stood him upon, to make good his lye; not knowinghow he should do it, rode after his Master, fearfully trembling allthe way. Gladly he would have made an escape, but hee could not by anypossible meanes, and on every side he looked about him, now before,and after behinde, to espy any Cranes standing on both their legges,which would have bin an ominous sight to him. But being come neereto the River, he chanced to see (before any of the rest) upon thebanke thereof, about a dozen Cranes in number, each of them standingbut upon one legge, as they use to do when they are sleeping.Whereupon, shewing them quickly to Messer Currado, he said. Now Siryour selfe may see, whether I told you true yesternight, or no: I amsure a Crane hath but one thigh, and one leg, as all here presentare apparant witnesses, and I have bin as good as my promise.

　　Messer Currado looking on the Cranes, and well understanding theknavery of his man, replyed: Stay but a little while sirra, and I willshew thee, that a Crane hath two thighes, and two legges. Thenriding somwhat neerer to them, he cryed out aloud, Shough, shough,which caused them to set downe their other legs, and all fled away,after they had made a few paces against the winde for theirmounting. So going unto Chichibio, he said: How now you lying Knave,hath a Crane two legs, or no? Chichibio being well-neere at his witsend, not knowing now what answer hee should make; but even as itcame sodainly into his minde, said: Sir, I perceive you are in theright, and if you would have done as much yesternight, and had cryedShough, as here you did: questionlesse, the Crane would then haveset down the other legge, as these heere did: but if (as they) she hadfled away too, by that meanes you might have lost your Supper.

　　This sodaine and unexpected witty answere, comming from such alogger-headed Lout, and so seasonably for his owne safety: was sopleasing to Messer Currado, that he fell into a hearty laughter, andforgetting all anger, saide. Chichibio, thou hast quit thy selfe well,and to my contentment: albeit I advise thee, to teach mee no more suchtrickes heereafter. Thus Chichibio, by his sodaine and merry answer,escaped a sound beating, which (otherwise) his master had inflicted onhim.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　WHEREBY MAY BEE OBSERVED, THAT SUCH AS WILL SPEAKE CONTEMPTIBLY OF

　　OTHERS, OUGHT (FIRST OF ALL) TO LOOKE

　　RESPECTIVELY ON THEIR OWNE IMPERFECTIONS

　　Messer Forese da Rabatte, and Maister Giotto, a Painter by hisprofession, comming together from Mugello, scornfully reprehendedone another for their deformity of body.

　　So soone as Madame Neiphila sate silent (the Ladies having greatlycommended the pleasant answer of Chichibio) Pamphilus, by command fromthe Queene, spake in this manner. Woorthy Ladies, it commeth topasse oftentimes, that like as Fortune is observed divers wayes, tohide under vile and contemptible Arts, the most great andunvalewable treasures of vertue (as, not long since, was welldiscoursed unto us by Madame Pampinea:) so in like manner hathappeared; that Nature hath infused very singular spirits into mostmishapen and deformed bodies of men. As hath beene noted in two of ourowne Citizens, of whom I purpose to speake in fewe words. The one ofthem was named Messer Forese de Rabatta, a man of little and lowperson, but yet deformed in body, with a flat face, like a Terrieror Beagle, as if no comparison (almost) could bee made more ugly.But notwithstanding all this deformity, he was so singularlyexperienced in the Lawes, that all men held him beyond any equall,or rather reputed him as a Treasury of civill knowledge.

　　The other man, being named Giotto, had a spirit of so greatexcellency, as there was not any particular thing in Nature, theMother and Worke-mistresse of all, by continuall motion of theheavens; but hee by his pen and pensell could perfectly portrait;shaping them all so truly alike and resemblable, that they weretaken for the reall matters indeede; and, whether they were present orno, there was hardly any possibility of their distinguishing. Sothat many times it happened, that by the variable devises he made, thevisible sence of men became deceived, in crediting those things tobe naturall, which were but meerly painted. By which meanes, heereduced that singular Art to light, which long time before had lyenburied, under the grosse error of some; who, in the mysterie ofpainting, delighted more to content the ignorant, then to please thejudicious understanding of the wise, he justly deserving thereby, tobe tearmed one of the Florentines most glorious lights. And so muchthe rather, because he performed all his actions, in the true andlowly spirit of humility: for while he lived, and was a Master inhis Art, above all other Painters: yet he refused any such title,which shined the more majestically- in him, as appeared by such, whoknew Much lesse then he, or his Schollers either: yet his knowledgewas extreamly coveted among them.

　　Now, notwithstanding all this admirable excellency in him: he wasnot (thereby) a jot the handsommer man (either in person orcountenance) then was our fore-named Lawyer Messer Forese, andtherefore my Novell concerneth them both. Understand then (faireAssemblie) that the possessions and inheritances of Messer Foreseand Giotto, lay in Mugello; wherefore, when Holy-dayes were celebratedby Order of Court, and in the Sommer time, upon the admittance of soapt a vacation; Forese rode thither upon a very unsightly jade, suchas a man can sildome meet with worse. The like did Giotto the Painter,as ill fitted every way as the other; and having dispatched theirbusines there, they both returned backe towards Florence, neither ofthem being able to boast, which was the best mounted.

　　Riding on a faire and softly pace, because their Horses could goe nofaster: and they being well entred into yeeres, it fortuned (asoftentimes the like befalleth in Sommer) that a sodaine showre ofraine overtooke them; for avoyding whereof, they made all possiblehaste to a poore Countreymans Cottage, familiarly knowne to them both.Having continued there an indifferent while, and raine unlikely tocease: to prevent allfurther protraction of time, and to arriveatFlorence in due season; they borrowed two old cloakes of the pooreman, of over-worn and ragged Country gray, as also two hoodes of thelike Complexion, (because the poore man had no better) which didmore mishape them, then their owne ugly deformity, and made themnotoriously flouted and scorned, by all that met or over-tooke them.

　　After they had ridden some distance of ground, much moyled andbemyred with their shuffling jades, flinging the dirt every wayabout them, that well they might be termed two filthy companions:the raine gave over, and the evening looking somewhat cleare, theybegan to confer familiarly together. Messer Forese, riding a loftyFrench trot, everie step being ready to hoise him out of his saddle,hearing Giottos discreete answers to every ydle question he made(for indeede he was a very elegant speaker) began to peruse andsurveigh him, even from the foote to the head, as we use to say. Andperceiving him to be so greatly deformed, as no man could be worse, inhis opinion: without any consideration of his owne mishaping as bad,or rather more unsightly then hee; in a scoffing laughing humour,hee saide. Giotto, doest thou imagine, that a stranger, who hadnever seene thee before, and should now happen into our companie,would beleeve thee to bee the best Painter in the world, as indeedethou art? Presently Giotto (without any further meditation) returnedhim this answere. Signior Forese, I think he might then beleeve it,when (beholding you) hee could imagine that you had learned yourA. B. C. Which when Forese heard, he knew his owne error, and saw hispayment returned in such Coine, as he sold his Wares for.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE SIXTH NOVEL

　　Michiele Scalza proves to some young men that the family of theBaronchi was the most noble in the world, for which he gets a goodsupper.

　　Michiele Scalza, a young Florentine, had so facetious and productivea genius that the principal youth of Florence took a great deal ofpleasure in and thought it an honour to enjoy his company. Being oneday at Mont Ughi with many gentlemen, the discussion happened to runupon the antiquity and nobility of the Florentine families. Somegave the preference to that of the Uberti, others to that of theLamberti, everyone speaking, as people ordinarily do, according totheir different humours and interests.

　　When Scalza heard what they all had to say, he smiling cried: "Youare none of you in the right. I will maintain the family of theBaronchi to be the most ancient and noble not only in Florence butalso in the whole world. All philosophers and such as can besupposed to know that family,. I'm confident, are of my opinion; andthat you may not mistake my meaning I must tell you I mean theBaronchi our neighbours, who dwell near Santa Maria Maggiore." Theyall presently fell a-laughing, and asked him whether he took themfor people of the other world that they should not know the Baronchias well as he. "Gentlemen," says Scalza, "I am so far from takingyou for people of the other world that I will lay any one of you agood supper enough for six on what I affirm, and be judged by whom youplease."

　　The wager was laid, and they all agreed to leave the decision toPietro di Florentino, who was then present. Everyone expected Scalzawould lose, and began to laugh at him beforehand. He that was todetermine the matter, being very judicious, first heard the reasons ofthe opposite party, and then asked Scalza how he could prove hisassertion.

　　"I will prove it so sufficiently," says he, that you shall all bethoroughly convinced. Gentlemen," says he, "by how much a family ismost ancient by so much it is most noble. The family of the Baronchiis the most ancient in Florence, ergo it is the most noble. I havenothing, then, to prove but the antiquity of the Baronchi. This willappear in that Prometheus made them at the time that he first began tolearn to paint, and made others after he was master of his art. Toconvince you of this, do but examine the figures of the one and theother: you'll find art and proportion in the composition of the one,whereas the others are but rough-drawn and imperfect. Among theBaronchi you'll meet with one with a long narrow face, another witha prodigiously broad one; one is flat-nosed, another has a nose thatmeasures an ell; one has a long chin and jaws like an ass, another hashis short and flat, and is monkey-faced. Nay, there are some of themthat have but one eye either larger or lower than the others have.In a word, their faces for all the world resemble such as childrenmake when they first begin to draw. Prometheus, you will allow, mustbe no great master when he made these figures, as I told you before;and consequently they must be more noble as they are more ancient."

　　So diverting an argument made them all to laugh heartily. Therepresentation he gave of the Baronchi was so ust and natural thatthey all agreed he had won: and nothing was heard for a full quarterof an hour but "Scalza has won!" and "The Baronchi are the mostancient and noble family in all Florence!"

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, OF WHAT WORTH IT IS TO CONFESSE

　　TRUETH, WITH A FACETIOUS AND WITTY EXCUSE

　　Madam Philippa, being accused by her Husband Rinaldo de Pugliese,because he tooke her in Adulterie, with a yong Gentleman namedLazarino de Guazzagliotri: caused her to bee cited before the Judge.From whom she delivered her selfe, by a sodaine, witty, and pleasantanswer, and moderated a severe strict Statute, formerly made againstwomen.

　　After that Madame Fiammetta had given over speaking, and all theAuditory had sufficiently applauded the Schollers honest revenge,the Queene enjoyned Philostratus, to proceede on next with his Novell,which caused him to begin thus. Beleeve me Ladies, it is anexcellent and most commendable thing, to speak well, and to allpurposes: but I hold it a matter of much greater worth, to know how todo it, and when necessity doth most require it. Which a Gentlewoman(of whom I am now to speake) was so well enstructed in, as not onelyit yeelded the hearers mirthfull contentment, but likewise deliveredher from the danger of death, as (in few words) you shal hearerelated.

　　In the Citie of Pirato, there was an Edict or Statute, no lesseblameworthy (to speake uprightly) then most severe and cruell, which(without making any distinction) gave strict command; That everieWoman should be burned with fire, who husband found her in the acte ofAdultery, with any secret or familiar friend, as one deserving tobee thus abandoned, like such as prostituted their bodies to publikesale or hire. During the continuance of this sharpe Edict, it fortunedthat a Gentlewoman, who was named Phillippa, was found in herChamber one night, in the armes of a yong Gentleman of the sameCity, named Lazarino de Guazzagliotri, and by her owne husband,called Rinaldo de Pugliese, shee loving the young Gallant, as her ownelife, because hee was most compleate in all perfections, and every wayas deerely addicted to her.

　　This sight was so irkesome to Rinaldo, that, being overcom withextreame rage, hee could hardly containe from running on them, witha violent intent to kill them both: but feare of his owne lifecaused his forbearance, meaning to be revenged by some better way.Such was the heate of his spleene and fury, as, setting aside allrespect of his owne shame: he would needs prosecute the rigour ofthe deadly Edict, which he held lawfull for him to do, although itextended to the death of his Wife. Heereupon, having witnessessufficient, to approove the guiltinesse of her offence: a day beingappointed (without desiring any other counsell) he went in person toaccuse her, and required justice against her.

　　The Gentlewoman, who was of an high and undauntable spirite, asall such are, who have fixed their affection resolvedly, and loveuppon a grounded deliberation: concluded, quite against the counselland opinion of her Parents, Kindred, and Friends; to appeare in theCourt, as desiring rather to dye, by confessing the trueth with amanly courage, then by denying it, and her love unto so worthy aperson as he was, in whose arms she chanced to be taken; to livebasely in exile with shame, as an eternall scandall to her race. So,before the Potestate, shee made her apparance, worthily accompaniedboth with men and women, all advising her to deny the acte: but she,not minding them or their perswasions, looking on the Judge with aconstant countenance, and a voyce of setled resolve, craved to know ofhim, what hee demaunded of her?

　　The Potestate well noting her brave carriage, her singular beautieand praiseworthy parts, her words apparantly witnessing the heighth ofher minde: beganne to take compassion on her, and doubted, leastshee would confesse some such matter, as should enforce him topronounce the sentence of death against her. But she boldly scorningall delayes, or any further protraction of time; demanded again,what was her accusation? Madame, answered the Potestate, I am soryto tel you, what needs I must, your husband (whom you see presentheere) is the complainant against you, avouching, that he tooke you inthe act of adultery with another man: and therefore he requireth,that, according to the rigour of the Statute heere in force with us, Ishould pronounce sentence against you, and (consequently) theinfliction of death. Which I cannot do, if you confesse not thefact, and therefore be well advised, how you answer me, and tell methe truth, if it be as your Husband accuseth you, or no.

　　The Lady, without any dismay or dread at all, pleasantly thusreplied. My Lord, true it is, that Rinaldo is my Husband, and thathe found me, on the night named, betweene the Armes of Lazarino, wheremany times heeretofore he hath embraced mee, according to themutuall love re-plighted together, which I deny not, nor ever will.But you know well enough, and I am certaine of it, that the Lawesenacted in any Countrey, ought to be common, and made with consentof them whom they concerne, whichin this Edict of yours is quitecontrarie. For it is rigorous against none, but poore women onely, whoare able to yeeld much better content and satisfaction generally, thenremaineth in the power of men to do. And moreover, when this Law wasmade, there was not any woman that gave consent to it, neither werethey called to like or allow thoreof: in which respect, it maydeservedly be termed, an unjust Law. And if you will, in prejudiceof my bodie, and of your owne soule, be the executioner of sounlawfull an Edict, it consisteth in your power to do as you please.

　　But before you proceede to pronounce any sentence, may it please youto favour me with one small request, namely, that you would demandof my Husband, if at all times, and whensoever he tooke delight inmy company, I ever made any curiosity, or came to him unwillingly.Whereto Rinaldo, without tarrying for the Potestate to moove thequestion, sodainly answered; that (undoubtedly) his wife at all times,and oftner then he could request it, was never sparing of herkindnesse, or put him off with any deniall. Then the Lady,continuing on her former speeches, thus replyed. Let me then demand ofyou my Lord, being our Potestate and Judge, if it be so, by myHusbands owne free confession, that he hath alwaies had his pleasureof me, without the least refusall in me, or contradiction; what shouldI doe with the over-plus remaining in mine owne power, and whereofhe had no need? Would you have mee cast it away to the Dogges? Wasit not more fitting for me, to pleasure therwith a worthy Gentleman,who was even at deaths doore for my love, then (my husbandssurfetting, and having no neede of me) to let him lye languishing, anddye?

　　Never was heard such an examination before, and to come from a womanof such worth, the most part of the honourable Pratosians (bothLords and Ladies) being there present, who hearing her urge such anecessary question, cryed out all loud together with one voice(after they had laughed their fill) that the Lady had saide well,and no more then she might. So that, before they departed thence, bycomfortable advice proceeding from the Potestate: the Edict (beingreputed overcruell) was modified, and interpreted to concerne themonely, who offered injurie to their Husbands for money. By whichmeanes Rinaldo standing as one confounded, for such a foolish andunadvised enterprize, departed from the Auditorie: and the Ladie,not a little joyfull to bee thus freed and delivered from the fire,returned home with victorie to her owne house.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE EIGHTH NOVELL

　　IN JUST SCORNE OF SUCH UNSIGHTLY AND ILL-PLEASING SURLY SLUTS, WHO

　　IMAGINE NONE TO BE FAIRE OR WELL-FAVOURED, BUT

　　THEMSELVES

　　Fresco da Celatico, counselled and advised his Neece Cesca: Thatif such as deserved to be looked on, were offensive to her eyes, asshe had often told him; she should forbeare to looke on any.

　　All the while as Philostratus was recounting his Novell; itseemed, that the Ladies (who heard it) found themselves much moovedthereat, as by the wanton blood mounting up into their cheekes, itplainly appeared.

　　But in the end, looking on each other with strange behaviour, theycould not forbeare smiling: which the Queene interrupting by a commandof attention, turning to Madame Aemillia, willed her to follow next.When she, puffing and blowing, as if she had bene newly awaked fromsleepe, began in this manner.

　　Faire Beauties; My thoughts having wandred a great distance hence,and further then I can easily collect them together againe; inobedience yet to our Queene, I shall report a much shorter Novell,then otherwise (perhappes) I should have done, if my minde had beene alittle neerer home. I shall tell you the grosse fault of a foolishDamosell, well corrected by a witty reprehension of her Unckle; ifshee had bin endued but with so much sence, as to have understood it.

　　An honest man, named Fresco da Celatico, had a good fulsom wenchto his Neece, who for her folly and squemishnes, was generallycalled Cesta, or nice Francesca. And althogh she had staturesufficient, yet none of the handsomest, and a good hard favourdcountenance, nothing nere such Angelical beauties as we have seen; yetshe was endued with such height of minde, and so proud an opinion ofher selfe, that it appeared as a custome bred in hir, or rather a giftbestowed on hir by nature (thogh none of the best) to blame anddespise both men and women, yea whosoever she lookt on; without anyconsideration of her self, she being as unsightly, ill shaped, andugly faced, as a worse was very hardly to be found.

　　Nothing could be done at any time, to yeilde her liking orcontent: moreover, she was so waspish, nice and squemish, that whenshe cam into the royall Court of France, it was hatefull andcontemptible to hir. Whensoever she went through the streets, everything stunke and was noisome to her; so that she never did any thingbut stop her nose; as if all men or women she met withall; andwhatsoever else she lookt on, were stinking and offensive. But letus leave all further relation of her ill conditions, being every way(indeed) so bad, and hardly becomming any sensible body, that wecannot condemne them so much as we should.

　　It chanced upon a day, that shee comming home to the house where herUnckle dwelt, declared her wonted scurvy and scornfull behaviour;swelling, puffing, and pouting extreamly, in which humor she sat downeby her Unckle, who desiring to know what had displeased her, said. Whyhow now Francesca? what may the meaning of this bee? This being asolemne festivall day, what is the reason of your so soone returninghome? She coily biting the lip, and brideling her head, as if shehad bene some mans best Gelding, sprucely thus replyed.

　　Indeede you say true Unckle, I am come home verie earely, because,since the day of my birth, I never saw a City so pestered withunhandsome people, both men and women, and worse this high Holyday,then ever I did observe before. I walked thorow some store ofstreetes, and I could not see one proper man: and as for the women,they are the most mishapen and ugly creatures, that, if God had mademe such an one, I should be sory that ever I was borne. And being nolonger able to endure such unpleasing sights; you wil not thinke(Unckle) in what an anger I am come home. Fresco, to whome thesestinking qualities of his Neece seemed so unsufferable, that hee couldnot (with patience) endure them any longer, thus short and quickelyanswered. Francesca, if all people of our Citie (both men and women)be so odious in thy eyes, and offensive to thy nose, as thou hastoften reported to me: bee advised then by my counsell. Stay stil athome, and look upon none but thy selfe onely, and then thou shalt besure that they cannot displease thee. But shee, being as empty ofwit as a pith-lesse Cane, and yet thought her judgement to exceedSalomons, could not understand the lest part of hir Unkles meaning,but stood as senselesse as a sheepe. Onely she replyed, that she wouldresort to some other parts of the country, which if shee found asweakly furnished of handsome people, as heere shee did, shee wouldconceive better of her selfe, then ever she had done before.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　NOTABLY DISCOVERING THE GREAT DIFFERENCE THAT IS BETWEENE

　　LEARNING AND IGNORANCE, UPON JUDICIOUS APPREHENSION

　　Signior Guido Cavalcante, with a sodaine and witty answer,reprehended the rash folly of certaine Florentine Gentlemen, thatthought to scorne and flout him.

　　When the Queene perceived, that Madame Aemillia was discharged ofher Novell, and none remained now to speake next, but onely her selfe,his priviledge alwayes remembred, to whom it belonged to be thelast, she began in this manner.

　　Faire Company, you have this day disappointed me of two Novells atthe least, whereof I had intended to make use. Neverthelesse, youshall not imagine mee so unfurnished, but that I have left one instore; the conclusion whereof, may minister such instruction, aswill not bee reputed for ydle and impertinent: but rather of suchmateriall consequence, as better hath not this day past among us.

　　Understand then (most faire Ladies) that in former times longsince past, our Cittie had many excellent and commendable customesin it; whereof (in these unhappy dayes of ours) we cannot say thatpoore one remaineth, such hath beene the too much encrease of Wealthand Covetousnesse, the onely supplanters of all good qualitieswhatsoever. Among which lawdable and friendly observations, therewas one well deserving note, namely, that in divers places ofFlorence, men of the best houses in every quarter, had a sociableand neighbourly assemblie together, creating their company toconsist of a certaine number, such as were able to supply theirexpences; as this day one, and to morrow another: and thus in akinde of friendly course, each dally furnished the Table, for the restof the company. Oftentimes, they did honour to divers Gentlemen andstrangers, upon their arrivall in our Citty, by inviting them intotheir assembly, and many of our worthiest Citizens beside; so thatit grew to a customary use, and one especially day in the yeareappointed, in memory of this so loving a meeting, when they would ride(triumphally as it were) on horsebacke thorow the Cittie, sometimesperforming Tilts, Tourneyes, and other Martiall exercises, but theywere reserved for Feastivall dayes.

　　Among which company, there was one called, Signior BettoBruneleschi, who was earnestly desirous, to procure Signior GuidoCavalcante de Cavalcanti, to make one in this their friendlysociety. And not without great reason: for, over and beside hisbeing one of the best Logitians as those times could not yeeld abetter: He was also a most absolute naturall Philosopher (which worthyqualities were little esteemed among these honest meeters) a veryfriendly Gentleman, singularly well spoken, and whatsoever else wascommendable in any man, was no way wanting in him, being wealthywithall, and able to returne equall honors, where he found them tobe duly deserved, as no man therin could go beyond him. But SigniorBetto, notwithstanding his long continued importunitie, could not drawhim into their assembly, which made him and the rest of his companyconceive, that the solitude of Guido, retiring himselfe alwaies fromfamiliar conversing with men: provoked him to many curiousspeculations: and because he retained some part of the EpicureanOpinion, their vulgare judgement passed on him, that hisspeculations tended to no other end, but onely to finde out that whichwas never done.

　　It chanced upon a day, that Signior Guido departing from theChurch of Saint Michaell d'Horta, and passing along by the Adamari, sofarre as to Saint Johns Church, which evermore was his customarieWalke: many goodly Marble Tombes were then about the saide Church,as now adayes are at Saint Reparata, and divers more beside. Heentring among the Collumbes of Porphiry, and the other Sepulchersbeing there, because the doore of the Church was shut: Signior Bettoand his companie, came riding from S. Reparata, and espying SigniorGuldo among the graves and tombes, said. Come, let us go make somejests to anger him. So putting the spurs to their horses, they rodeapace towards him: and being upon him before he perceived them, one ofthem said. Guido thou refusest to be one of our society, and seekestfor that which never was: when thou hast found it, tell us, whatwilt thou do with it?

　　Guido seeing himselfe round engirt with them, sodainly thus replyed:Gentlemen, you may use mee in your owne house as you please. Andsetting his hand on one of the Tombes (which was some-what great) hetooke his rising, and leapt quite over it on the further side, asbeing of an agile and sprightly body, and being thus freed fromthem, he went away to his owne lodging. They stoode all like menamazed, strangely looking one upon another, and began afterward tomurmure among themselves: That Guido was a man without anyunderstanding, and the answer which he had made unto them, was to nopurpose, neither favoured of any discretion, but meerely came froman empty brain because they had no more to do in the place where nowthey were, then any of the other Citizens, and Signior Guido(himselfe) as little as any of them; whereto Signior Betto thusreplyed.

　　Alas Gentlemen, it is you your selves that are void ofunderstanding: for, if you had but observed the answer which he madeunto us: hee did honestly, and (in verie few words) not onelynotably expresse his owne wisedome, but also deservedly reprehendus. Because, if wee observe things as we ought to doe, Graves andTombes are the houses of the dead, ordained and prepared to be theirlatest dwellings. He tolde us moreover, that although we have heere(in this life) other habitations and abidings; yet these (or the like)must at last be our houses. To let us know, and all other foolish,indiscreete, and unleartied men, that we are worse then dead men, incomparison of him, and other men equall to him in skill andlearning. And therefore, while wee are heere among these Graves andMonuments, it may well be said, that we are not farre from our ownehouses, or how soone we shall be possessors of them, in regard ofthe frailty attending on us.

　　Then every one could presently say, that Signior Guido had spokennothing but the truth, and were much ashamed of their owne folly,and shallow estimation which they had made of Guido, desiring nevermore after to meddle with him so grossely, and thanking Signior Betto,for so well reforming their ignorance, by his much betterapprehension.

　　THE SIXT DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN MAY BE OBSERVED, WHAT PALPABLE ABUSES DO MANY TIMES

　　PASSE, UNDER THE COUNTERFEIT CLOAKE OF RELIGION

　　Fryer Onyon, promised certaine honest people of the Countrey, toshew them a Feather of the same Phoenix, that was with Noah in hisArke. In sted whereof, he found Coales, which he avouched to bethose very coals, wherewith the same Phoenix was roasted.

　　When of them had delivered their Novels, Dioneus knowing, that itremained in him to relate the last for this day: without attending forany solemne command (after he had imposed silence on them, thatcould not sufficiently commend the witty reprehension of Guido),thus he began. Wise and worthy Ladies, although by the priviledgeyou have granted, it is lawfull for me to speake any thing bestpleasing to my self: yet notwithstanding, it is not any part of mymeaning, to varrie from the matter and method, whereof you have spokento very good purpose. And therefore, following your footsteppes, Ientend to tell you, how craftily, and with a Rampiar sodainly raisedin his owne defence: a Religious Frier of Saint Anthonies Order,shunned a shame, which two O wily companions had prepared for him. Norlet it offend you, if I run into more large discourse, then this dayhath bene used by any, for the apter compleating of my Novell:because, if you well observe it, the Sun is as yet in the middest ofheaven, and therefore you may the better forbeare me.

　　Certaldo, as (perhaps) you know, or have heard, is a Village inthe Vale of Elsa, and under the authority and commaund of ourFlorence, which although it be but small: yet (in former times) ithath bin inhabited with Gentlemen, and people of especiall respect.A religious Friar of S. Anthonies Order, named Friar Onyon, had longtime used to resort thither, to receive the benevolent almes, whichthose charitably affected people in simplicity gave him, and chieflyat divers daies of the year, when their bounty and devotion wouldextend themselves more largely then at other seasons. And so muchthe rather, because they thought him to be a good Pastor of holylife in outward appearance, and carried a name of much greater matter,then remained in the man indeed; beside, that part of the countryyeilded far more plentifull abundance of Onyons, then all other inTuscany elsewhere, a kinde of foode greatly affected by thoseFriars, as men alwaies of hungry and good appetite. This Friar Onyonwas a man of litle stature red haire, a chearfull countenance, and theworld afforded not a more crafty companion, then he. Moreover,albeit he had very little knowledge or learning, yet he was so prompt,ready and voluble of speech, uttering often he knew not what himselfe:that such as were not wel acquainted with his qualities, supposedhim to be a singular Rhetoritian, excelling Cicero or Quintilianthemselves; and he was a gossip, friend, or deerely affected, by everyone dwelling in those parts. According to his wonted custome, one timehe went thither in the month of August, and on a Sunday morning,when all the dwellers thereabout, were present to heare Masse, andin the chiefest Church above all the rest: when the Friar saw timeconvenient for his purpose, he advanced himselfe, and began tospeake in this manner.

　　Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, you know you have kept a commendablecustom, in sending yeerly to the poore brethren of our Lord Baron S.Anthony, both of your Corne and other provision, some more, somelesse, all according to their power, means, and devotion, to the endthat blessed S. Anthony should be the more carefull of your oxen,sheep, asses, swine, pigs, and other cattle. Moreover, you have usedto pay (especially such as have their names registred in ourFraternity) those duties which annually you send unto us. For thecollection whereof, I am sent by my Superior, namely our L. Abbot, andtherfore (with Gods blessing) you may come after noone hither, whenyou shal heare the Bels of the Church ring: then wil I make apredication to you; you shall kisse the Crosse, and beside, becauseI know you al to be most devout servants to our Lord Baron S. Anthony,in especiall grace and favor, I wil shew you a most holy and goodlyRelique, which I my selfe (long since) brought from the holy Landbeyond the seas. If you desire to know what it is, let me tell you,that it is one of the Feathers of the same Phoenix, which was in theArke with the Patriarch Noah. And having thus spoken, he becamesilent, returning backe to heare Masse. While hee delivered theseand the like speeches, among the other people then in the church,there were two shrewde and crafty Companions; the one, named John deBragoniero, and the other, Biagio Pizzino. These subtile Fellowes,after they had heard the report of Fryer Onyons Relique: althoghthey were his intimate friends, and came thither in his company; yetthey concluded betweene themselves, to shew him a tricke ofLegierdumaine, and to steale the Feather from him. When they hadintelligence of Friar Onyons dining that day at the Castle, with aworthy Friend of his: no sooner was he set at the Table, but away wentthey in all haste, to the Inne where the Fryar frequented, with thisdetermination, that Biagio should hold conference with the Friars boy,while his fellow ransackt the Wallet, to finde the Feather, andcarry it away with him, for a future observation, what the Friar wouldsay unto the people, when he found the losse of the Feather, and couldnot performe his promise to them.

　　The Fryars Boy, whom some called Guccio Balena, some Guccio Imbrata,and others Guccio Porco, was such a knavish Lad, and had so many badqualities, as Lippo Topo the cunning Painter, or the most curiousPoeticall wit, had not any ability to describe them. Friar Onyonhimself did often observe his behaviour, and would make this reportamong his Friends. My Boy (quoth he) hath nine rare qualities inhim, and such they are, as if Salomon, Aristotle, or Seneca hadonely but one of them: it were sufficient to torment and trouble alltheir vertue, all their senses, and all their sanctity. Consider then,what manner of man he is like to be, having nine such rarities, yetvoide of all vertue, wit, or goodnes. And when it was demaunded ofFriar Onyon, what these nine rare conditions were: hee having them allreadie by heart, and in rime, thus answered.

　　Boyes I have knowne, and seene,

　　And heard of many:

　　But,

　　For Lying, Loytring, Lazinesse,

　　For Facing, Filching, Filthinesse;

　　For Carelesse, Gracelesse, all Unthriftinesse,

　　My Boy excelleth any.

　　Now, over and beside all these admirable qualities, hee hath maniemore such singularities, which (in favour towards him) I am faine toconceale. But that which I smile most at in him, is, that he wouldhave a Wife in every place where he commeth, yea, and a good houseto boot too: for, in regard his beard beginneth to shew it selfe,rising thicke in haire, blacke and amiable, he is verily perswaded,that all Women will fall in love with him; and if they refuse tofollow him, he will in all hast run after them. But truly, he is anotable servant to mee, for I cannot speake with any one, and in neverso great secrecy, but he will be sure to heare his part; and whenany question is demanded of me, he standes in such awe and feare of mydispleasure: that he will bee sure to make the first answer, yea orno, according as he thinketh it most convenient.

　　Now, to proceede where we left, Friar Onyon having left thisserviceable youth at his lodging, to see that no bodie should meddlewith his commodities, especially his Wallet, because of the sacredthings therein contained: Guccio Imbrata, who as earnestly affected tobe in the Kitchin, as Birds to hop from branch to branch,especially, when anie of the Chamber-maides were there, espyed oneof the Hostesses Female attendants, a grosse fat Trugge, low ofstature, ill faced, and worse formed, with a paire of brests liketwo bumbards, smelling loathsomely of grease and sweate; downe sheedescended into the Kitchin, like a Kite upon a peece of Carion. ThisBoy, or Knave, chuse whither you will style him, having carelesly leftFryar Onyons Chamber doore open, and all the holy things so much to beneglected, although it was then the moneth of August, when heate is inthe highest predominance, yet hee would needs sit downe by the fire,and began to conferre with this amiable creature, who was called bythe name of Nuta.

　　Being set close by her, he told her, that he was a Gentleman byAtturniship, and that he had more millions of Crownes, then all hislife time would serve him to spend; beside those which he payed awaydayly, as having no convenient im-ployment for them.

　　Moreover, he knew how to speake, and do such things, as werebeyond wonder or admiration. And, never remembring his olde tatterdFriars Cowle, which was so snottie and greazie, that good store ofkitchin stuffe might have beene boiled out of it; as also a fouleslovenly Trusse or halfe doublet, all baudied with bowsing, fatgreazie lubberly sweating, and other drudgeries in the ConventKitchin, where he was an Officer in the meanest credite. So that todescribe this sweet youth in his lively colours, both for naturallperfections of body, and artificiall composure of his Garments;never came the fowlest silks out of Tartaria or India, more ugly orunsightly to bee lookt upon. And for a further addition to his neateknavery, his breeches were so rent betweene his legges, his shooes andstockings had bin at such a mercilesse massacre: that the gallantestCommandador of Castile (though he had never so lately bin releastout of slavery) could have wisht for better garments, then he; or makelarger promises, then he did to his Nuta. Protesting to entitle her ashis onely, to free her from the Inne and Chamber thraldomes, if shewould live with him, be his Love, partaker of his present possessions,and so to succeed in his future Fortunes. All which bravadoes,though they were belcht foorth with admirable insinuations: yet theyconverted into smoke, as all such braggadochio behaviours do, and hewas as wise at the ending, as when he began.

　　Our former named two craftie Companions, seeing Guccio Porco soseriously employed about Nuta, was there-with not a littlecontented, because their intended labour was now more then halfeended. And perceiving no contradiction to crosse their proceeding,into Friar Onyons chamber entred they, finding it ready open for theirpurpose: where the first thing that came into their hand in search,was the wallet. When they had opened it, they found a small Cabinet,wrapped in a great many foldings of rich Taffata; and havingunfolded it, a fine formall Key was hanging thereat: wherwith havingunlockt the Cabinet, they found a faire Feather of a Parrots taile,which they supposed to bee the verie same, that he meant to shew thepeople of Certaldo. And truly (in those dayes) it was no hard matterto make them beleeve any thing, because the idle vanities of Aegyptand those remoter parts, had not (as yet) bin seene in Tuscany, assince then they have bin in great abundance, to the utter ruine(almost) of Italy.

　　And although they might then be knowne to very few, yet theinhabitants of the Country generally, understoode little or nothing atall of them. For there, the pure simplicitie of their ancientpredecessors still continuing; they had not seene any Parrots, or somuch as heard any speech of them. Wherefore the two crafty consorts,not a little joyfull of finding the Feather, tooke it thence withthem, and beecause they would not leave the Cabinet empty, espyingCharcoales lying in a corner of the Chamber, they filled it with them,wrapping it up againe in the Taffata, and in as demure manner asthey found it. So, away came they with the Feather, neither seene orsuspected by any one, intending now to heare what Friar Onyon wouldsay, uppon the losse of his precious Relique, and finding the Coalesthere placed insted thereof.

　　The simple men and women of the country, who had bin at morningMasse in the Church, and heard what a wonderful Feather they shouldsee in the after noone, returned in all hast to their houses, whereone telling this newes to another, and gossip with gossip consultingtheron; they made the shorter dinner, and afterward flocked in mainetroopes to the Castle, contending who shold first get entrance, suchwas their devotion to see the holy feather. Friar Onyon havingdined, and reposed a litle after his wine, he arose from the tableto the window, where beholding what multitudes came to see thefeather, he assured himselfe of good store of mony. Hereupon, hesent to his Boy Guccio Imbrata, that uppon the Bels ringing, he shouldcome and bring the wallet to him. Which (with much ado) he did, sosoone as his quarrell was ended in the kitchin, with the amiableChamber-maid Nuta, away then he went with his holy commodities:where he was no sooner arrived, but because his belly was readie toburst with drinking water, he sent him to the Church to ring the bels,which not onely would warme the cold water in his belly, butlikewise make him run as gaunt as a Grey-hound.

　　When all the people were assembled in the Church together, FriarOnyon (never distrusting any injurie offered him, or that his closecommodities had bin medled withal) began his predication, uttering athousand lies to fit his purpose. And when he came to shew the featherof the Phoenix (having first in great devotion finisht the confession)he caused two goodly torches to be lighted, and ducking downe his headthree severall times, before hee would so much as touch the Taffata,he opened it with much reverence. So soone as the Cabinet came to beseen, off went his Hood, lowly he bowed downe his body, and utteringespecial praises of the Phoenix, and sacred properties of thewonderfull Relique, the Cover of the Cabinet being lifted uppe, he sawthe same to bee full of Coales. He could not suspect his Villaineboy to do this deede, for he knew him not to be endued with so muchwit, onely hee curst him for keeping it no better, and cursthimselfe also, for reposing trust in such a careles knave, knowing himto be slothfull, disobedient, negligent, and void of all honestunderstanding or grace. Sodainly (without blushing) lest his losseshould be discerned, he lifted his lookes and hands to heaven,speaking out so loude, as every one might easily heare him, thus: Othou omnipotent providence, for ever let thy power be praised. Thenmaking fast the Cabinet againe, and turning himselfe to the people,with lookes expressing admiration, he proceeded in this manner.

　　Lords, Ladies, and you the rest of my worthy Auditors: You are tounderstand, that I (being then very young) was sent by my Superiour,into those parts, where the Sun appeareth at his first rising. And Ihad received charge by expresse command, that I should seeke for (somuch as consisted in my power to do) the especiall vertues andpriviledges belonging to Porcellane, which although the boylingthereof bee worth but little, yet it is very profitable to any but us.In regard whereof, being upon my journey, and departing from Venice,passing along the Borgo de Grecia, I proceeded thence (on horseback)through the Realme of Garbo, so to Baldacca, till I came to Parione;from whence, not without great extremity of thirst, I arrived inSardignia.

　　But why do I trouble you with the repetition of so many countries? Icoasted on still, after I had past Saint Georges Arme, into Truffia,and then into Buffia which are Countries much inhabited, and withgreat people. From thence I went into the Land of Lying, where I foundstore of the Brethren of our Religion, and many other beside, whoshunned all paine and labour, onely for the love of God, and caredas little, for the paines and travailes which others tooke, exceptsome benefit arised thereby to them; nor spend they any money inthis Country, but such as is without stampe. Thence I went into theLand of Abruzzi, where the men and women goe in Galoches over theMountaines, and make them garments of their Swines guts. Not farrefrom thence, I found people, that carried bread in their staves, andwine in Satchels, when parting from them, I arrived among theMountaines of Bacchus, where all the waters run downe with a deepefall, and in short time, I went on so far, that I found my selfe to bein India Pastinaca; where I swear to you by the holy habit which Iweare on my body, that I saw Serpents Bye, things incredible, and suchas were never seene before.But because I would be loth to lye, so soone as I departed thence,I met with Maso de Saggio, who was a great Merchant there, and whomI found cracking Nuts, and selling Cockles by retale. Neverthelesse,al this while I could not finde what I sought for, and therefore I wasto passe from hence by water, if I intended to travaile thither, andso into the Holy Land, where coole fresh bread is sold for fourepence, and the hot is given away for nothing. There I found thevenerable Father (blame me not I beseech you) the most woorthiePatriarch of Jerusalem, who for the reverence due to the habite Iweare, and love to our Lord Baron Saint Anthony, would have me tosee al the holy Reliques, which he had there under his charge:wherof there were so many, as if I should recount them all to you, Inever could come to a conclusion. But yet not to leave youdiscomforted, I will relate some few of them to you. First of all,he shewed me the finger of the holy Ghost, so whole and perfect, asever it was. Next, the nose of the Cherubin, which appeared to SaintFrances; with the payring of the naile of a Seraphin; and one of theribbes of Verbum caro, fastened to one of the Windowes' covered withthe holy garments of the Catholique Faith. Then he tooke me into adarke Chappel, where he shewed me divers beames of the Starre thatappeared to the three Kings in the East. Also a Violl of SaintMichaels sweate, when he combatted with the divell: And the jaw-boneof dead Lazarus, with many other precious things beside. And because Iwas liberall to him, giving him two of the Plaines of Monte Morello,in the Vulgare Edition, and some of the Chapters del Caprezio, whichhe had long laboured in search of; he bestowed on me some of hisReliques. First, he gave me one of the eye-teeth of Santa Crux; anda litle Violl, filled with some part of the sound of those Belles,which hung in the sumptuous Temple of Salomon. Next, he gave mee theFeather of the Phoenix, which was with Noah in the Arke, as before Itold you. And one of the Woodden Pattens, which the good Saint Gerrardde Magnavilla used to weare in his travailes, and which I gave (notlong since) to Gerrardo di Bousy at Florence, where it is respectedwith much devotion. Moreover, he gave me a few of those Coales,wherwith the Phoenix of Noah was roasted; all which things I broughtaway thence with me. Now, most true it is, that my Superiour wouldnever suffer mee to shew them any where, untill he was faithfullycertified, whether they were the same precious Reliques, or no. Butperceyving by sundrie Myracles which they have wrought, and Letters ofsufficient credence receyved from the reverend Patriarch, that allis true, he hath graunted me permission to them, and because I woldnot trust any one with matters of such moment, I my selfe brought themhither with me. Now I must tell you, that the Feather of the samePhoenix, I conveyed into a small Cabinet or Casket, because itshould not be bent or broken. And the Coales wherewith the saidPhoenix was roasted, I put into another Casket, in all respects solike to the former, that many times I have taken one for another. Asnow at this instant it hath bin my fortune: for, imagining that Ibrought the Casket with the feather, I mistooke my self, and broughtthe other with the coales. Wherein doubtles I have not offended,because I am certaine, that we of our Order do not any thing, but itis ordred by divine direction, and our blessed Patron the LordeBaron Saint Anthony. And so much the rather, because about a senighthence, the Feast of Saint Anthony is to bee solemnized, against thepreparation whereof, and to kindle your zeale with the greaterfervencie: he put the Casket with the Coales into my hand, meaning,let you see the Feather, at some more fitting season. And therefore myblessed Sonnes and Daughters, put off your Bonnets, and come hitherwith devotion to looke upon them. But first let me tell you, whosoeveris marked by any of these Coales, with the signe of the Crosse: heor she shal live all this yeare happily, and no fire whatsoevershall come neere to touch or hurt them. So, singing a solemneAntheme in the praise of S. Anthony, he unveyled the Casket, andshewed the Coales openly.The simple multitude, having (with great admiration and reverence)a long while beheld them, they thronged in crouds to Fryar Onyon,giving him farre greater offerings, then before they had, andentreating him to marke them each after other. Whereupon, he takingthe coales in his hand, began to marke their garments of white, andthe veyles on the Womens heads, with Crosses of no meane extendure:affirming to them, that the more the Coales wasted with making thosegreat crosses, the more they still encreased in the Casket, as oftenbefore hee had made triall.

　　In this manner, having crossed all the Certaldanes (to his greatbenefit) and their abuse: he smiled at his sodaine and dexteriousdevise, in mockery of them, who thought to have made a scorne ofhim, by dispossessing him of the Feather. For Bragoniero andPizzino, being present at his Learned predication, and having heardwhat a cunning shift he found, to come off cleanly, without theleast detection, and all delivered with such admirableprotestations: they were faine to forsake the Church, least theyshould have burst with laughing.

　　But when all the people were parted and gone, they met Friar Onyonat his Inne, where closely they discovered to him, what they had done,delivering him his Feather againe: which the yeare following, didyeeld him as much money, as now the Coales had done.

　　This Novell affoorded equall pleasing to the whole companie, FriarOnyons Sermon being much commended, but especially his longPilgrimage, and the Reliques he had both seene, and brought homewith him. Afterward, the Queene perceiving, that her reigne had nowthe full expiration, graciously she arose, and taking the Crownefrom off her owne head, placed [it] on the head of Dioneus, saying. Itis high time Dioneus, that you should taste part of the charge andpaine, which poore women have felt and undergone in their soveraigntieand government: wherefore, be you our King, and rule us with suchawefull authority, that the ending of your dominion may yeelde usall contentment. Dioneus being thus invested with the Crowne, returnedthis answer.

　　I make no doubt (bright Beauties) but you many times have seene asgood, or a better King among the Chessemen, then I am. But yet of acertainty, if you would be obedient to me, as you ought in dutieunto a true King: I should grant you a liberall freedome of that,wherein you take the most delight, and without which, our choisestdesires can never be compleate. Neverthelesse, I meane, that mygovernment shal be according to mine owne minde. So, causing theMaster of the Houshold to be called for, as all the rest were wontto do for conference with him: he gave him direction, for al thingsfitting the time of his Regiment, and then turning to the Ladies, thushe proceeded.

　　Honest Ladies, we have alreadie discoursed of variable devises,and so many severall manners of humane industry, concerning thebusines wherewith Lacisca came to acquaint us: that her very words,have ministred me matter, sufficient for our morrowes conference, orelse I stand in doubt, that I could not have devised a more convenientTheame for us to talke on. She (as you have all heard) saide, thatshee had not anie neighbour, who came a true Virgin to her Husband,and added moreover, that she knew some others, who had beguiledtheir Husbandes, in very cunning and crafty manner. But settingaside the first part, concerning the proofe of children, I conceivethe second to bee more apte for our intended argument. In whichrespect, my will is (seeing Lacisca hath given us so good an occasion)that our discoursing to morow, may onely concerne such slye cunningand deceits, as women have heeretofore used, for satisfying their owneappetites, and beguiling their Husbands, without their knowledge, orsuspition, and cleanly escaping with them, or no.

　　This argument seemed not very pleasing to the Ladies, andtherefore they urged an alteration thereof, to some matter bettersuting with the day, and their discoursing: whereto thus heanswered. Ladies, I know as well as your selves, why you would havethis instant argument altered: but to change me from it you have nopower, considering the season is such, as shielding all (both menand women) from medling with any dishonest action; it is lawfull forus to speake of what wee please. And know you not, that through thesad occasion of the time, which now overruleth us, the judges haveforsaken their venerable benches, the Lawes (both divine and humane)ceasing, granting ample license to every one, to do what bestagreeth with the conservation of life? Therefore, if your honestiesdoe straine themselves a little, both in thinking and speaking, notfor prosecution of any immodest deede, but onely for familiar andblamelesse entercourse: I cannot devise a more convenient ground, atleast that carrieth apparant reason, for reproofe of perils, toensue by any of you. Moreover, your company, which hath bin mosthonest, since the first day of our meeting, to this instant: appearethnot any jot to be disgraced, by any thing either said or done, neithershal be (I hope) in the meanest degree.

　　And what is he, knowing your choise and vertuous dispositions, sopowerfull in their owne prevailing, that wanton words cannotmisguide your wayes, no nor the terror of death it selfe, that dareinsinuate a distempred thought? But admit, that some slight or shallowjudgements, hearing you (perhaps sometimes) talke of such amorousfollies, should therefore suspitiously imagine you to be faulty, orelse you would bee more sparing of speech? Their wit and censure areboth alike, savouring rather of their owne vile nature, who wouldbrand others with their basebred imperfections. Yet ther is anotherconsideration beside, of som great injury offered to mine honor, andwhereof I know not how you can acquit your selves.

　　I that have bin obedient to you all, and borne the heavy load ofyour businesse, having now (with full consent) created mee yourKing, you would wrest the law out of my hands, and dispose of myauthoritie as you please. Forbeare (gentle Ladies) all frivolotissuspitions, more fit for them that are full of bad thoughts, then you,who have true Vertue shining in your eyes; and therefore, let everyone freely speake their minde, according as their humors best pleaseththem.

　　When the Ladies heard this, they made answer, that all should beeanswerable to his minde. Whereupon, the King gave them all leave todispose of themselves till supper time. And because the Sun was yetvery high, in regard all the re-counted Novels had bin so short:Dioneus went to play at the Tables with another of the yong Gentlemen,and Madame Eliza, having withdrawne the Ladies aside, thus spakeunto them. During the time of our being heere, I have often benedesirous to let you see a place somwhat neere at hand, and which Isuppose you have never seene, it being called The Valley of Ladies.Till now, I could not finde any convenient time to bring youthither, the Sunne continuing still aloft, which fitteth you withthe apter leysure, and the sight (I am sure) can no way discontentyou.

　　The Ladies replyed, that they were all ready to walk with herthither: and calling one of their women to attend on them, they seton, without speaking a word to any of the men. And within the distanceof halfe a mile, they arrived at the Valley of Ladies, wherinto theyentred by a strait passage at the one side, from whence there issuedforth a cleare running River. And they found the saide Valley to beeso goodly and pleasant, especially in that season, which was thehottest of all the yeare; as all the world was no where able toyeeld the like. And, as one of the said Ladies (since then) related tomee, there was a plaine in the Valley so directly round, as if ithad beene formed by a compasse, yet rather it resembled theWorkmanship of Nature, then to be made by the hand of man:containing in circuite somewhat more then the quarter of a mile,environed with sixe small hils, of no great height, and on each ofthem stood a little Palace, shaped in the fashion of Castles.

　　The ground-plot descending from those hils or mountaines, grew lesseand lesse by variable degrees, as wee observe at entering into ourTheaters, from the highest part to the lowest, succinctly to narrowthe circle by order. Now, concerning these ground-plottes or littleMeadowes, those which the Sun Southward looked on, were full of Vines,Olive-trees, Almond-trees, Cherry-trees, and Figge-trees, withdivers other Trees beside, so plentifully bearing fruites, as youcould not discerne a hands bredth of losse. The other Mountaines,whereon the Northerne windes blow, were curiously covered with smallThickets or Woods of Oakes, Ashes, and other Trees so greene andstraite, as it was impossible to behold fairer. The goodly plaine itselfe, not having any other entrance, but where the Ladies came in,was planted with Trees of Firre, Cipresse, Laurell, and Pines; sosingularly growing in formall order, as if some artificiall or cunninghand had planted them, the Sun hardly piercing through their branches,from the top to the bottome, even at his highest, or any part of hiscourse.

　　All the whole field was richly spred with grasse, and such varietyof delicate Flowers, as Nature yeilded out of her plenteousStore-house. But that which gave no lesse delight then any of therest, was a smal running Brooke, descending from one of the Vallies,that divided two of the little hils, and fell through a Veine of theintire Rocke it selfe, that the fall and murmure thereof was mostdelightfull to heare, seeming all the way in the descent, likeQuickesilver, weaving it selfe into artificiall workes, and arrivingin the plaine beneath, it was there receyved into a small Channell,swiftly running through the midst of the plaine, to a place where itstayed, and shaped it selfe into a Lake or Pond, such as ourCitizens have in their Orchards or Gardens, when they please to makeuse of such a commodity.

　　This Pond was no deeper, then to reach the breast of a man, andhaving no mud or soyle in it, the bottome thereof shewed like smallbeaten gravell, with prety pibble stones intermixed, which some thathad nothing else to do, would sit downe and count them as they lay, asvery easily they might. And not onely was the bottome thusapparantly seene, but also such plenty of Fishes swimming every way,as the mind was never to be wearied in looking on them. Nor was thiswater bounded in with any bankes, but onely the sides of the plainMedow, which made it appeare the more sightly, as it arose in swellingplenty. And alwayes as it superabounded in his course, least it shouldoverflow disorderly: it fell into another Channell, which conveying italong the lower Valley, ran forth to water other needfull places.

　　When the Ladies were arrived in this goodly valley, and upon advisedviewing it, had sufficiently commended it: in regard the heat of thedry was great, the place tempting, and the Pond free from sight ofany, they resolved there to bathe themselves. Wherefore they sentthe waiting Gentlewoman to have a diligent eye on t way where theyentered, least any one should chance to steale upon them. All seven ofthem being stript naked, into the water they went, which hid theirdelicate white bodies, like as a cleare Glasse concealeth a DamaskRose within it. So they being in the Pond, and the water nothingtroubled by their being there, they found much prety pastime together,running after the Fishes, to catch them with their hands, but theywere overquicke and cunning for them. After they had delightedthemselves there to their owne contentment, and were cloathed withtheir garments, as before: thinking it fit time for their returningbacke againe, least their over-long stay might give offence, theydeparted thence in an easie pace, dooing nothing else all the way asthey went, but extolling the Valley of Ladies beyond all comparison.

　　At the Palace they arrived in a due houre, finding the threeGentlemen at play, as they left them, to whom Madame Pampineapleasantly thus spake. Now trust me Gallants, this day wee have verycunningly beguiled you. How now? answered Dioneus, begin you firstto act, before you speake? Yes truly Sir, replyed Madame Pampinea:

　　Relating to him at large, from whence they came, what they haddone there, the beautie of the place, and the distance thence. TheKing (upon hir excellent report) being very desirous to see it;sodainely commaunded Supper to be served in, which was no soonerended, but they and their three servants (leaving the Ladies) walkedon to the Valley, which when they had considered, no one of themhaving ever bin there before; they thought it to be the Paradise ofthe World.

　　They bathed themselves there likewise, as the Ladies formerlie haddone, and being re-vested, returned backe to their Lodgings, becausedarke night drew on apace: but they found the Ladies dauncing, to aSong which Madame Fiammetta sung. When the dance was ended, theyentertained the time with no other discourse, but onely concerning theValley of Ladies, whereof they all spake liberally in commendations.Whereupon, the King called the Master of the Houshold, giving himcommand, that (on the morrow) dinner should be readie betimes, andbedding to be thence carried, if any desired rest at mid-time of theday.

　　All this being done, variety of pleasing Wines were brought,Banquetting stuffe, and other dainties; after which they fell toDauncing. And Pamphilus, having receyved command to begin anespecial dance, the King turned himselfe unto Madame Eliza, speakingthus. Faire Lady, you have done me so much honour this day, as todeliver mee the Crowne: in regard whereof, be you this night theMistresse of the song: and let it be such as best may please yourselfe. Whereunto Madam Eliza, with a modest blush arising in her face,replyed; That his will should be fulfilled, and then (with adeficate voyce) she beganne in this manner.

　　THE SONG

　　The Chorus sung by all

　　Love, if I can scape free from forth thy holde,

　　Beleeve it for a truth,

　　Never more shall thy falshoode me enfolde.

　　When I was yong, I entred first thy fights,

　　Supposing there to finde a solemne peace:

　　I threw off all my Armes, and with delights

　　Fed my poore hopes, as still they did encrease.

　　But like a Tyrant, full of rancorous hate,

　　Thou tookst advantage:

　　And I sought refuge, but it was too late.

　　Love, if I can scape free, etc.

　　But being thus surprized in thy snares,

　　To my misfortune, thou madst me her slave;

　　Was onely borne to feede me with despaires,

　　And keepe me dying in a living grave.

　　For I saw nothing dayly fore mine eyes,

　　But rackes and tortures:

　　From which I could not get in any wise.

　　Love, if I can scape free, etc.

　　My sighes and teares I vented to the winde,

　　For none would heare or pittie my complaints;

　　My torments still encreased in this kinde,

　　And more and more I felt these sharpe restraints.

　　Release me now at last from forth his hell.

　　Asswage thy rigour,

　　Delight not thus in cruelty to dwell.

　　Love, if I can scape free, etc.

　　If this thou wilt not grant, be yet so kinde,

　　Release me from those worse then servile bands,

　　Which new vaine hopes have bred, wherein I finde;

　　Such violent feares, as comfort quite withstands.

　　Be now (at length) a little moov'd to pittie,

　　Be it nere so little:

　　Or in my death listen my Swan-like Dittie.

　　Love, if I can scape free from forth thy holde,

　　Beleeve it for a truth,

　　Never more shall thy falshood me enfolde.

　　After that Madame Eliza had made an end of her Song, which sheesealed up with an heart-breaking sigh: they all sate amazedlywondering at her moanes, not one among them being able toconjecture, what should be the reason of her singing in this manner.But the King being in a good and pleasing temper, calling Tindaro,commaunded him to bring his Bagge-pipe, by the sound whereof theydanced divers daunces: And a great part of the night being spent inthis manner, they all gave over, and departed to their Chambers.

　　THE INDUCTION TO THE SEVENTH DAY

　　WHEN THE ASSEMBLY BEING MET TOGETHER, AND UNDER THE REGIMENT OF

　　DIONEUS: THE DISCOURSES ARE DIRECTED, FOR THE DISCOVERIE OF SUCH

　　POLICIES AND DECEITES, AS WOMEN HAVE USED FOR BEGUILING OF THEIR

　　HUSBANDES, EITHER IN RESPECT OF THEIR LOVE, OR FOR THE PREVENTION

　　OF SOME BLAME OR SCANDALL, ESCAPING WITHOUT SIGHT, KNOWLEDGE,

　　OR OTHERWISE

　　All the Starres were departed out of East, but onely that, whichcommonly cal bright Lucifer, the Day-Star, gracing the morning verygloriously: when the Master of the household, being risen, went withall the provision, to the Valley of Ladies, to make everie thing indue and decent readines, according as his Lord over-night hadcommanded him. After which departure of his, it was not long beforethe King arose, beeing awaked with the noise which the carriages made;and when he was up, the other two Gentlemen and the Ladies werequickly readie soone after.

　　Such as were so disposed, were licensed by the King to take theirrest: and they that would not, he permitted them to their wontedpastimes, each according to their minds. But when they were risen fromsleepe, and the rest from their other exercises, it seemed to bemore then high time, that they should prepare for talke andconference. So, sitting downe on Turky Carpets, which were spredabroad on the green grasse, and close by the place where they haddined: the King gave command, that Madam Aemillia should firstbegin, whereto she willingly yeelding obedience, and expecting suchsilent attention, as formerly had bin, thus she began.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　REPREHENDING THE SIMPLICITY OF SOME SOTTISH HUSBANDS: AND

　　DISCOVERING THE WANTON SUBTILTIES OF SOME WOMEN, TO COMPASSE

　　THEIR UNLAWFULL DESIRES

　　John of Lorraine heard one knocke at his doore in the night time,whereuppon he awaked his Wife Monna Tessa. She made him beleeve,that it was a Spirit which knocked at the doore, and so they arose,going both together to conjure the Spirit with a prayer; andafterwardes, they heard no more knocking.

　　My Gracious Lord (quoth Madame Aemillia) it had bene a matter highlypleasing to mee, that any other (rather then my selfe) should havebegun to speake of this argument, which it hath pleased you to apoint.But seeing it is your Highnesse pleasure, that I must make a passageof assurance for all the rest; I will not be irregular, becauseobedience is our cheefe Article. I shall therefore (Gracious Ladies)strive, to speake something, which may bee advantageable to youheereafter, in regard, that if other women bee as fearfull as we,especially of Spirits, of which all our sexe have generally bintimorous (although, upon my credite, I know not what they are, norever could meete with any, to tell me what they be) you may, by thediligent observation of my Novell: learne a wholsome and holyprayer, very availeable, and of precious power, to conjure and drivethem away, whensoever they shall presume to assault you in any place.

　　There dwelt sometime in Florence, and in the street of SaintBrancazio, a woollen Weaver, named John of Lorrayne; a man morehappy in his Art, then wise in any thing else beside: because,savouring somewhat of the Gregorie, and (in very deede)

　　little lesse then an Ideot; Hee was many times made Captain of theWoollen Weavers, in the quarters belonging to Santa Maria Novella, andhis house was the Schoole or receptacle, for all their meetings andassemblies. He had divers other petty Offices beside, by the gnity andauthority whereof, hee supposed himselfe much exalted or elevated,above the common pitch of other men. And this humour became the moretractable to him, because he addicted himselfe oftentimes (as beinga man of an easie inclination) to be a benefactor to the holyFathers of Santa Maria Novella, giving (beside his other charitableAlmes) to some one a paire of Breeches, to another a Hood, and toanother a whole habit. In reward whereof, they taught him (by heart)many wholsome prayers, as the Pater noster in the vulgar tongue; theSong of Saint Alexis; the Lamentations of Saint Bernard, the Hymneof Madame Matilda, and many other such like matters, which he keptcharily, and repeated usually, as tending to the salvation of hissoule.

　　This man, had a very faire and lovely wife, named Monna Tessa, thedaughter of Manuccio della Cuculia, wise and well advised; who knowingthe simplicity of her Husband, and affecting Frederigo di NeriPegolotti, who was a comely yong Gentleman, fresh, and in the floureof his time, even as she was, therefore they agreed the bettertogether. By meanes of her Chambermaid, Frederigo and shee met oftentogether, at a Countrie Farme of John of Lorraynes, which hee hadneere to Florence, and where she used to lodge all the Summer time,called Camerata, whether John resorted somtimes to Supper, and lodgefor a night, returning home againe to his City house the next morning;yet often he would stay there longer with his owne companions.

　　Frederigo, who was no meane man in his Mistresses favor, andtherefore these private meetings the more welcome to him; received asummons or assignation from her, to be there on such a night, when hirhusband had no intent of comming thither. There they supped merrilytogether, and (no doubt) did other things, nothing appertaining to ourpurpose, she both acquainting, and well instructing him, in a dozen(at the least) of her Husbands devout prayers. Nor did shee make anyaccount, or Frederigo either, that this should be the last time oftheir meeting, because (indeede) it was not the first: and therforethey set downe an order and conclusion together (because theChambermaide must be no longer the messenger) in such manner as youshall heare.

　　Frederigo was to observe especially, that alwayes when hee went orcame from his owne house, which stood much higher then John ofLorraynes did, to looke upon a Vine, closely adjoyning to her house,where stood the scull of an Asses head, advanced upon an high pole;and when the face thereof looked towards Florence, he might safelycome, it being an assured signe, that John kept at home. And if hefound the doore fast shut, he should softly knocke three severalltimes, and thereon bee admitted entrance. But if the face stoodtowards Fiesola; then he might not come, for it was the signe of Johnsbeing there, and then there might be no medling at all.

　　Having thus agreed upon this conclusion, and had many merry meetingstogether: one night above the rest, when Frederigo was appointed tosuppe with Monna Tessa, who had made ready two fat Capons, drest inmost dainty and delicate manner: it fell out so unfortunately, thatJohn (whose Kue was not to come that night) came thither very late,yet before Frederigo, wherewith she being not a little offended,gave John a slight supper, of Lard, Bacon, and such like coarseprovision, because the other was kept for a better guest. In the meanetime, and while John was at supper, the Maide (by her Mistressesdirection) had conveighed the two Capons, with boyled Eggs, Breadand a Bottle of Wine (all folded up in a faire cleane table cloth)into her Garden, that a passage to it, without entering into thehouse, and where shee had divers times supt with Frederigo. Shefurther willed the Maide, to set all those things under a Peachtree, which adjoyned to the fields side: but, so angry she was ather husbands unexpected comming, that shee forgot to bid her tarriethere, till Frederigoes comming, and to tell him of Johns being there:as also, to take what he found prepared readie for his Supper.

　　John and she being gone to bed together, and the Maide likewise,it was not long after, before Frederigo came, and knocking once softlyat the doore, which was very neere to their lodging Chamber, Johnheard the noise, and so did his wife. But to the end, that Johnmight not have the least scruple of suspition, she seemed to be fastasleepe; and Frederigo pausing a while, according to the orderdirected, knockt againe the second time. John wondering thereat verymuch, jogd his wife a litle, and saide to her: Tessa, hearest thounothing? Methinkes one knocketh at our doore. Monna Tessa, who wasbetter acquainted with the knocke, then plaine honest meaning Johnwas, dissembling as if shee awaked out of a drowsie dreame, saide:Alas Husband, dost thou know what this is? In the name of ourblessed Ladie, be not affraid, this is but the Spirit which haunts ourCountrey houses, whereof I have often told thee, and it hath manytimes much dismayed me, living heere alone without thy comfort. Nay,such hath bin my feare, that in divers nights past, so soone as Iheard the knockes: I was feigne to hide my selfe in the beddeover-head and eares (as we usually say) never daring to be so bold, asto looke out, untill it was broad open day. Arise good wife (quothJohn) and if it be such a Spirit of the Countrey, as thou talkestof, never be affraid; for before we went to bed, I said the Telucis,the Intemerata, with many other good prayers beside. Moreover, Imade the signe of the Crosse at every corner of our bed, in the nameof the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, so that no doubt at all needs tobe made, of any power it can have to hurt or touch us.

　　Monna Tessa, because (perhaps) Frederigo might receive some othersuspition, and so enter into distaste of her by anger or offence:determined to arise indeede, and to let him covertly understand,that John was there, and therefore saide to her husband. Beleeve meJohn, thy counsell is good, and every one of thy words hath wisedomein it: but I hold it best for our owne safety, thou being heere;that wee should conjure him quite away, to the end he may never morehaunt our house. Conjure him Wife? Quoth John, By what meanes? andhow? Bee patient good man (quoth Tessa) and I will enstruct thee, Ihave learned an excellent kinde of conjuration; for, the last weeke,when I went to procure the pardons at Fiesola, one of the holy recluseNuns, who (indeede John) is my indeered Sister and Friend, and themost sanctimonius in life of them all; perceiving me to be troubledand terrified by Spirits; taught me a wholsome and holy prayer, andprotested withall, that shee had often made experiment thereof, beforeshe became a Recluse, and found it (alwayes) a present helpe to her.Yet never durst I adventure to essay it, living heere by my selfeall alone: but honest John, seeing thou art heere with me, we willgo both together, and conjure this Spirit. John replyed, that he wasvery willing; and being both up, they went fayre and softly to thedoore, where Frederigo stoode still without, and was growne somewhatsuspitious of his long attendance.

　　When they were come to the doore, Monna Tessa said to John: Thoumust cough and spet, at such time as I shall bid thee. Well (quothJohn) I will not faile you. Immediately she beganne her prayer in thismanner.

　　Spirit, that walkst thus in the night,

　　Poore Countrey people to affright:

　　Thou hast mistane thy marke and ayme,

　　The head stood right, but John home came,

　　And therefore thou must packe away,

　　For I have nothing else to say:

　　But to my Garden get the gone,

　　Under the Peach-tree stands alone,

　　There shalt thou finde two Capons drest,

　　And Egges laide in mine owne Hennes nest,

　　Bread, and a Bottle of good Wine,

　　All wrapt up in a cloath most fine.

　　Is not this good Goblins fare?

　　Packe and say you have your share;

　　Not doing harme to John or me,

　　Who this night keepes me companie.

　　No sooner had she ended her devoute conjuring prayer, but shesaide to her husband: Now John, cough and spet: which John accordinglydid. And Frederigo, being all this while without, hearing her wittyconjuration of a Spirit, which he himselfe was supposed to be, beingridde of his former jealous suspition: in the middst of all hismelancholy, could very hardly refraine from laughing, the jestappeared so pleasing to him: But when John cought and spet, softlyhe said to himselfe: When next thou spetst, spet out all thy teeth.

　　The woman having three severall times conjured the Spirite, insuch manner as you have already heard; returned to bed againe with herhusband: and Frederigo, who came as perswaded to sup with her, beingsupperlesse all this while; directed by the words of Monna Tessa inhir praier, went into the Garden. At the foot of the Peach-tree, therehe found the linnen cloth, with the two hot Capons, Bread, Egges,and a Bottle of Wine in it, all which he carried away with him, andwent to Supper at better leysure. Oftentimes afterward, upon othermeetings of Frederigo and she together, they laughed heartily at herenchantment, and the honest beleefe of silly John.

　　I cannot deny, but that some do affirme, that the Woman had turnedthe face of the Asses head towards Fiesola, and a Country Travailerpassing by the Vine, having a long piked staffe on his necke: thestaffe (by chance) touched the head, and made it turne divers timesabout, and in the end faced Florence, which being the cal forFrederigoes comming, by this meanes he was disappointed. In likemanner some say, that Monna Tessaes prayer for conjuring the Spirit,was in this order.

　　Spirit, Spirit, thy way,

　　And come againe some other day.

　　It was not I that turnd the head,

　　But some other. In our Bed

　　Are John and I: Go from our dore,

　　And see thou trouble us no more.

　　So that Frederigo departed thence, both with the losse of his labourand supper. But a neighbour of mine, who is a woman of good yeares,told me, that both the one and other were true, as she her selfeheard, when she was a little Girle. And concerning the latteraccident, it was not to John of Lorrayne, but to another, named Johnde Nello, that dwelt at S. Peters Gate, and of the same professionas John of Lorrayne was. Wherefore (faire Ladies) it remaineth in yourowne choice, to entertain which of the two prayers you please, or bothtogether if you will: for they are of extraordinary vertue in suchstrange occurrences, as you have heeretofore heard, and (upon doubt)may prove by experience. It shall not therefore be amisse for you,to learne them both by hart, for (peradventure) they may stand youin good sted, if ever you chance to have the like occasion.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, WHAT HARD AND NARROW SHIFTS AND DISTRESSES,

　　SUCH AS BEE SERIOUSLY LINKED IN LOVE, ARE MANY TIMES ENFORCED TO

　　UNDERGO: ACCORDING AS THEIR OWNE WIT, AND CAPACITIE OF THEIR

　　SURPRIZERS, DRIVE THEM TO IN EXTREMITIES

　　Peronella hid a yong man her friend and Lover, under a great brewingFat, upon the sodaine returning home of her Husband; who told her,that hee had solde the saide Fat and brought him that bought it, tocary it away. Peronella replyed, that shee had formerly solde itunto another, who was now underneath it, to see whether it werewhole and sound, or no. Whereupon, he being come forth from underit; she caused her Husband to make it neate and cleane, and so thelast buyer carried it away.

　　Not without much laughter and good liking, was the Tale of MadameAemillia listened unto, and both the prayers commended to be sound andsoveraigne: but it being ended, the King commaunded Philostratus, thathee should follow next in order, whereupon thus he began.

　　Deare Ladies, the deceites used by men towards your sexe, butespecially Husbands, have bene so great and many, as when it hathsometime happened, or yet may, that husbands are requited in theself-same kinde: you need not finde fault at any such accident, eitherby knowledge thereof afterward, or hearing the same reported by anyone; but rather you should referre it to generall publication, tothe end, that immodest men may know, and finde it for trueth, thatif they have apprehension and capacity; women are therein not a joteinferiour to them. Which cannot but redound to your great benefite,because, when any one knoweth, that another is as cunning andsubtile as himselfe; he will not be so rashly adventurous indeceite. And who maketh any doubt, that if those sleights and trickes,whereof this dayes argument may give us occasion to speake, shouldafterwardes be put in execution by men: would it not minister justreason, of punishing themselves for beguiling you, knowing, that (ifyou please) you have the like abilitie in your owne power? Mine intenttherefore is to tell you, what a woman (though but of meanequalitie) did to her husband, upon a sodaine, and in a moment (as itwere) for her owne safety.

　　Not long since, there lived in Naples, an honest meane man, whodid take to Wife, a fayre and lustie young Woman, being namedPeronella.-He professing the Trade of a Mason, and shee Carding andSpinning, maintained themselves in a reasonable condition, abating andabounding as their Fortunes served. It came to passe, that acertayne young man, well observing the beauty and good parts ofPeronella, became much addicted in affection towardes her: and byhis often and secret sollicitations, which he found not to beunkindely entertayned; his successe proved answerable to his hope,no unindifferencie appearing in their purposes, but where her estateseemed weakest, his supplies made an addition of more strength.

　　Now, for their securer meeting, to stand cleare from all matter ofscandal or detection, they concluded in this order between themselves.Lazaro, for so was Peronellaes Husband named, being an earely riserevery morning, either to seeke for worke, or to effect it beingundertaken: this amorous friend being therewith acquainted, andstanding in some such convenient place, where hee could see Lazaroesdeparture from his house, and yet himselfe no way discerned; pooreLazaro was no sooner gone, but presently he enters the house, whichstood in a verie solitarie street, called the Avorio. Many morningshad they thus met together, to their no meane delight andcontentation, till one especial morning among the rest, when Lazarowas gone forth to worke, and Striguario (so was the amorous youngman named) visiting Peronella in the house: upon a verie urgentoccasion, Lazaro returned backe againe, quite contrary to his formerwont, keeping foorth all day, and never comming home till night.

　　Finding his doore to be fast lockt, and he having knockt softlieonce or twice, he spake in this manner to himselfe. Fortune I thankethee, for albeit thou hast made mee poore, yet thou hast bestowed abetter blessing on me, in matching me with so good, honest, and lovinga Wife. Behold, though I went early out of my house, her selfe hathrisen in the cold to shut the doore, to prevent the entrance oftheeves, or any other that might offend us. Peronella having heardwhat her husband sayde, and knowing the manner of his knocke, saidfearfully to Striguario. Alas deare friend, what shall wee doe? I amlittle lesse then a dead Woman: For, Lazaro my Husband is come backeagain, and I know not what to do or say. He never returned in thisorder before now, doubtlesse, hee saw when you entred the doore; andfor the safety of your honour and mine: creepe under this brewing Fat,till I have opened the doore, to know the reason of his so soonereturning.

　　Striguario made no delaying of the matter, but got himselfe closelieunder the Fat, and Peronella opening the doore for her husbandsenterance, with a frowning countenance, spake thus unto him. Whatmeaneth this so early returning home againe this morning? Itseemeth, thou intendest to do nothing to day, having brought backe thytooles in thy hands? If such be thine intent, how shall we live? Whereshal we have bread to fill our bellies? Dooest thou thinke, that Iwill suffer thee to pawne my gowne, and other poore garments, asheeretofore thou hast done? I that card and spinne both night and day,till I have worne the flesh from my fingers; yet all will hardly findeoyle to maintaine our Lampe. Husband, husband, there is not oneneighbour dwelling by us, but makes a mockerie of me, and tels meplainly, that I may be ashamed to drudge and moyle as I do;wondering not a little, how I am able to endure it; and thou returnesthome with thy hands in thy hose, as if thou hadst no worke at all todo this day.

　　Having thus spoken, she fell to weeping, and then thus beganagain. Poore wretched woman as I am, in an unfortunate houre was Iborne, and in a much worse, when I was made thy Wife. I could have hada proper, handsome yong man; one, that would have maintained mee braveand gallantly: but, beast as I was, to forgoe my good, and cast myselfe away on such a beggar as thou art, and whom none wold havehad, but such an Asse as I. Other women live at hearts ease, and injollity, have their amorous friends and loving Paramours, yea, one,two, three at once, making their husbands looke like a Moone cressent,wheron they shine Sun-like, with amiable lookes, because they know nothow to helpe it: when I (poore foole) live heere at home a miserablelife, not daring once to dreame of such follies, an innocent soule,heartlesse and harmelesse.

　　Many times, sitting and sighing to my selfe: Lord, thinke I, of whatmettall am I made? Why should not I have a Friend in a corner,aswell as others have? I am flesh and blood, as they are, not madeof brasse or iron, and therefore subject to womens frailty. would thoushouldest know it husband, and I tell it thee in good earnest; That ifI would doe ill, I could quickely finde a friend at a neede.Gallants there are good store, who (of my knowledge) love medearely, and have made me very large and liberall promises, ofGolde, Silver, jewels, and gay Garments, if I would extend them theleast favour. But my heart will not suffer me, I never was thedaughter of such a mother, as had so much as a thought of suchmatters: no, I thanke our blessed Ladie, and S. Friswid for it: andyet thou returnest home againe, when thou shouldst be at Worke.

　　Lazaro, who stoode all this while like a well-beleeving Logger-head,demurely thus answered. Alas good Wife! I pray you bee not so angry, Inever had so much as an ill thought of you, but know wel enough whatyou are, and have made good proofe thereof this morning. Understandtherefore patiently (sweet Wife) that I went forth to my work as daylyI use to do, little dreaming (as I thinke you doe not) that it hadbene Holyday. Wife, this is the Feast day of Saint Galeone; whereon wemay in no wise worke, and this is the reason of my so soone returning.Neverthelesse (dear Wife) I was not carelesse of our Housholdprovision: For, though we worke not, yet we must have foode, which Ihave provided for more then a moneth. Wife, I remembred the brewingFat, whereof we have little or no use at all, but rather it is atrouble to the house, then otherwise. I met with an honest Friend, whostayeth without at the doore, to him I have sold the Fat for tenGigliatoes, and he tarrieth to take it away with him.

　　How Husband? replied Peronella, Why now I am worse offended thenbefore. Thou that art a man, walkest every where, and shouldst beexperienced in worldly affaires: wouldst thou bee so simple, as tosell such a brewing Fat for ten Gigliatoes? Why, I that am a pooreignorant woman, a house Dove, sildome going out of my doore: have soldit already for twelve Gigliatoes, to a very honest man, who (even alittle before thy comming home) came to me, we agreed on the bargaine,and he is now underneath the Fat, to see whether it be sound or no.When credulous Lazaro heard this, he was better contented then ever,and went to him that taried at the doore, saying. Good man, you maygoe your way, for, whereas you offered me but ten Gigliatoes for theFat, my loving wife hath sold it for twelve, and I must maintaine whatshee hath done: so the man departed, and the variance ended.

　　Peronella then saide to her husband. Seeing thou art come home soluckily, helpe me to lift up the Fat, that the man may come foorth,and then you two end the bargaine together. Striguario, who thogh hewas mewed up under the tubbe, had his eares open enough; and hearingthe witty excuse of Peronella, tooke himselfe free from futurefeare: and being come from under the Fat, pretending also, as if hehad herd nothing, nor saw Lazaro, looking round about him, said. Whereis this good woman? Lazaro stepping forth boldly like a man,replyed: Heere am I, what would you have Sir? Thou? quothStriguario, what art thou? I ask for the good wife, with whom I mademy match for the Fat. Honest Gentleman (answered Lazaro) I am thathonest Womans Husband, for lacke of a better, and I will maintainewhatsoever my Wife hath done.

　　I crie you mercie Sir, replyed Striguario, I bargained with yourWife for this brewing Fat, which I finde to be whole and sound: onlyit is uncleane within, hard crusted with some dry soile upon it, whichI know not well how to get off, if you will be the meanes of making itcleane, I have the money heere ready for it. For that Sir (quothPeronella) take you no care, although no match at all had beenemade, what serves my Husband for, but to make it cleane? Yesforsooth Sir, answered sily Lazaro, you shall have it neate and cleanebefore you pay the mony.

　　So, stripping himselfe into his shirt lighting a Candle, andtaking tooles fit for the purpose; the Fat was whelmed over him, andhe being within it, wrought untill he sweated, with scraping andscrubbing. So that these poore Lovers, what they could notaccomplish as they wold, necessity enforced them to performe as theymight. And Peronella, looking in at the vent-hole, where the Liquorrunneth forth for the meshing; seemed to instruct her husband in thebusinesse, as espying those parts where the Fat was fowlest, saying:There, there Lazaro, tickle it there, the Gentleman payes well for it,and is worthy to have it: but see thou do thy selfe no harme goodHusband. I warrant thee Wife, answered Lazaro, hurt not your selfewith leaning your stomacke on the Fat, and leave the cleansing of itto me. To be breefe, the Brewing Fat was neatly cleansed, Peronellaand Striguario both well pleased, the money paide, and honestmeaning Lazaro not discontented.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　SERVING AS A FRIENDLY ADVERTISEMENT TO MARRIED WOMEN, THAT MONKS,

　　FRIARS, AND PRIESTS MAY BE NONE OF THEIR GOSSIPS, IN

　　REGARD OF UNAVOYDABLE PERILLES ENSUING THEREBY

　　Friar Reynard, falling in love with a Gentlewoman, Wife to a manof good account; found the meanes to become her Gossip. Afterward,he being conferring closely with her in her Chamber, and her Husbandcoming sodainly thither: she made him beleeve, that he came thitherfor no other end; but to cure his God-sonne by a charme, of adangerous disease which he had by Wormes.

　　Philostratus told not this Tale so covertly, concerning Lazarossimplicity, and Peronellaes witty policy; but the Ladies found aknot in the rush, and laughed not a little, at his queint manner ofdiscoursing it. But upon the conclusion, the King looking upon MadamEliza, willed her to succeede next, which as willingly she granted,and thus began. Pleasant Ladies, the charme or conjuration wherwithMadam Aemillia laid her night-walking Spirit, maketh me remember aNovell of another enchantment; which although it carrieth notcommendation equall to the other, yet I intend to report it, becauseit suteth with our present purpose, and I cannot sodainly befurnisht with another, answerable thereto in nature.

　　You are to understand then, that there lived in Siena, a proper yongman, of good birth and well friended, being named Reynard. Earnestlyhe affected his neere dwelling neighbour, a beautifull Gentlewoman,and wife to a man of good esteeme: of whom hee grew halfe perswaded,that if he could (without suspition) compasse private conferencewith her, he should reach the height of his amorous desires. Yetseeing no likely meanes wherewith to further his hope, and sheebeing great with childe, he resolved to become a Godfather to thechilde, at such time as it should be brought to Christening. And beinginwardly acquainted with her Husband, who was named Credulano; suchfamiliar intercourses passed betweene them, both of Reynards kindeoffer, and Credulanoes as courteous acceptance, that hee was set downefor a Gossippe.

　　Reynard being thus embraced for Madam Agnesiaes Gossip, and thisproving the onely colourable meanes, for his safer permission ofspeech with her, to let her now understand by word of mouth, what longbefore she collected by his lookes and behaviour: it fell out no waybeneficiall to him, albeit Agnesia seemed not nice or scrupulous inhearing, yet she had a more precious care of her honor. It came topasse, within a while after (whether by seeing his labour vainlyspent, or some other urgent occasion moving him thereto, I know not)Reynard would needs enter into Religion, and whatsoever strictnesse orausteritie hee found to be in that kinde of life, yet he determined topersevere therein, whether it were for his good or ill. And althoughwithin a short space, after he was thus become a Religious Monke,hee seemed to forget the former love which he bare to his gossipAgnesia, and divers other enormous vanities beside: yet let me tellyou, successe of time tutord him in them again(!; and, without anyrespect to his poore ho habite, but rather in contempt thereof (asit were) he tooke an especiall delight, in wearing garments of muchricher esteeme, yet favoured by the same Monasticall profession,appearing (in all respects) like a Court-Minion or Favourite, of asprightly and Poeticall disposition, for composing Verses, Sonnets,and Canzons, singing them to sundry excellent instruments, and yet notgreatly curious of his company, so they were some of the best, andMadame Agnesia one, his former Gossip.

　　But why doe I trouble my selfe, in talking thus of our so latelyconverted Friar, holy Father Reynard, when they of longer standing,and reputed meerely for Saints in life, are rather much more vile thenhee? Such is the wretched condition of this world, that they shame not(fat, foggie, and nastie Abbey-lubbers) to shew how full-fedde theylive in their Cloysters, with cherry cheekes, and smooth shininglookes, gay and gaudy garments, far from the least expression ofhumility, not walking in the streets like Doves: but high-crested likeCockes, with well cramd gorges. Nay, which is worse, if you did butsee their Chambers furnished with Gally-pots of Electuaries,precious Unguents, Apothecary Boxes, filled with variousConfections, Conserves, excellent Perfumes, and other goodly Glassesof artificiall Oyles and Waters: beside Rundlets and small Barrelsfull of Greeke Wine, Muscatella, Lachrime Christi, and other such likemost precious Wines, so that (to such as see them) they seeme not tobee Chambers of Religious men; but rather Apothecaries Shoppes, orappertaining to Druggists, Grocers, or Perfumers.

　　It is no disgrace to them to be Gowty; because when other men knowit not, they alledge, that strict fasting, feeding on grosse Meates(though never so little,) continuall studying, and such likerestraints from the bodies freer exercise, maketh them subject to manyinfirmities. And yet, when any one of them chanceth to fall sicke, thePhysitian must minister no such counsell to them, as Chastity,Abstinence from voluptuous meats, Discipline of the body, or any ofthose matters appertaining to a modest religious life. For, concerningthe plaine, vulgar, and Plebeian people, these holy Fathers areperswaded, that they know nothing really belonging to asanctimonious life; as long watching, praying, discipline and fasting,which (in themselves) are not able, to make men look leane,wretched, and pale. Because Saint Dominicke, Saint Fraunces, anddivers other holy Saints beside, observed the selfesame religiousorders and constitutions, as now their carefull successors do.Moreover, in example of those fore-named Saints, who went welcloathed, though they had not three Garments for one, nor made ofthe finest Woollen excellent cloath: but rather of the very coarsestof all other, and of the common ordinary colour, to expell cold onely,but not to appear brave or gallant, deceyving thereby infinitesimple credulous soules, whose purses (neverthelesse) are their bestpay-masters.

　　But leave we this, and returne wee backe to vertuous FryarReynard, who falling again& to his former appetites; became an oftenvisitant of his Gossip Agnesia, and now hee had learned such ablushlesse kinde of boldnesse; that he durst be more instant withher (concerning his privie sute) then ever formerly he had bin, yeaeven to solicite the enjoying of his immodest desires. The goodGentlewoman, seeing her selfe so importunately pursued, and FriarReynard appearing now (perhappes) of sweeter and more delicatecomplexion, the at his entrance into Religion: at a set time of hissecret communing with her; she answered him in as apt tearmes, as theyuse to do, who are not greatly sqeamish, in granting mattersdemanded of them.

　　Why how now Friar Reynard? quoth shee, Doe Godfathers use to movesuch questions? Whereto the Friar thus replyed. Madam, when I havelaide off this holy habite (which is a matter very easie for mee todo) I shall seeme in your eye, in all respects made like anotherman, quite from the course of any Religious life. Agnesia, bitingthe lip with a prety smile, said; O my faire Starres! You will neverbee so unfriendly to me. What? You being my Gossip, would you haveme consent unto such a sinne? Our blessed Lady shield mee, for myghostly Father hath often told me, that it is utterly unpardonable:but if it were, I feare too much confiding on mine owne strength.Gossip, the Friar, you speake like a Foole, and feare (in this case)is wholly frivolous, especially, when the motions mooved by such anone as my selfe, who (upon repentance) can grant you pardon andindulgence presently. But I pray you let mee aske you one question,Who is the neerest Kinsman to your Son; either I, that stood at theFont for his Baptisme, or your Husband that begot him? The Lady madeanswere, that it was her Husband. You say very true Gossip, replyedthe Friar, and yet notwithstanding, doth not your Husband (both atboord and bed) enjoy the sweet benefit of your company? Yes, saidthe Lady, why shold he not? Then Lady (quoth Reynard) I, who am not soneere a Kinsman to your Sonne, as your Husband is, why may ye notafford mee the like favour, as you do him? Agnesia, who was noLogitian, and therefore could not stand on any curious answer,especially being so cuningly moved; beleeved, or rather made shew ofbeleeving, that the Godfather said nothing but truth, and thusanswered. What woman is she (Gossip) that knoweth how to answer yourstrange speeches? And, how it came to passe, I know not, but such anagreement passed betweene them, that, for once onely (so it mightnot infrindge the league of Gossip-ship, but that title to countenancetheir further intent) such a favour should be affoorded, so it mightstand cleare from suspition.

　　An especiall time being appointed, when this amorous Combateshould be fought in loves field, Friar Reynard came to his Gossipshouse, where none being present to hinder his purpose, but onely theNursse which attended on the child, who was an indifferent faire andproper woman: his holy brother that came thither in his company(because Friars were not allowed to walke alone) was sent aside withher into the Pigeon loft, to enstruct her in a new kinde of Paternoster, lately devised in their holy Convent. In the meane while, asFriar Reynard and Agnesia were entring into hir chamber, she leadingher little son by the hand, and making fast the doore for their bettersafety: the Friar laide by his holie habit, Cowle, Hood, Booke, andBeads, to bee (in all respects) as other men were. No sooner were theythus entred the Chamber, but her husband Credulano, being come intothe house, and unseen of any, staid not till he was at the Chamberdoore, where hee knockt, and called for his Wife.

　　She hearing his voice: Alas Gossip (quoth she) what shall I do? MyHusband knocketh at the doore, and now he will perceive the occasionof our so familiar acquaintance. Reynard being stript into hisTrusse and straite Strouses, began to tremble and quake exceedingly. Iheare your Husbands tongue Gossip, said he, and seeing no harme as yethath bin done, if I had but my garments on againe; wee would haveone excuse or other to serve the turne, but till then you may not openthe doore. As womens wits are sildome gadding abroad, when anynecessitie concerneth them at home: even so Agnesia, being sodainlyprovided of an invention, both how to speake and carry her selfe inthis extreamitie, saide to the Friar. Get on your garments quickely,and when you are cloathed, take your little God-son in your armes, andlistning wel what I shall say, shape your answeres according to mywords, and then refer the matter to me. Credulano had scarsely endedhis knocking, but Agnesia stepping to the doore said: Husband, Icome to you. So she opened the doore, and (going forth to him) witha chearefull countenance thus spake. Beleeve me Husband, you could nothave come in a more happy time, for our yong Son was sudainlyextreamly sicke, and (as good Fortune would have it) our loving GossipReynard chanced to come in; and questionlesse, but by his good prayersand other religious paynes, we had utterly lost our childe, for he hadno life left in him.

　　Credulano, being as credulous as his name imported, seemed readyto swoune with sodaine conceit: Alas good wife (quoth he) how hapnedthis? Sit downe sweet Husband said she, and I wil tell you al. Ourchild was sodainly taken with a swouning, wherein I being unskilful,did verily suppose him to be dead, not knowing what to doe, or say. Bygood hap, our Gossip Reynard came in, and taking the childe up inhis armes, said to me. Gossip, this is nothing else but Wormes inthe bellie of the childe, which ascending to the heart, must needskill the child, without all question to the contrary. But be of goodcomfort Gossip, and feare not, for I can charme them in such sort,that they shall all die, and before I depart hence, you shall see yourSon as healthfull as ever. And because the maner of this charm is ofsuch nature, that it required prayer and exorcising in two places atonce: Nurse went up with his Holye Brother into our Pigeon loft, toexercise their devotion there, while we did the like heere. For nonebut the mother of the childe must bee present at such a mystery, norany enter to hinder the operation of the charme; which was thereason of making fast the Chamber doore. You shall see Husband anonthe Childe, which is indifferently recovered in his armes, and ifNurse and his holy Brother were returned from theyr meditations; hesaith, that the charme would then be fully effected: for the childbeginneth to looke chearefull and merry.

　　So deerely did Credulano love the childe, that hee verilybeleeved, what his Wife had saide, never misdoubting any othertreachery: and, lifting up his eyes, with a vehement sigh, said. Wife,may not I goe in and take the child into my armes? Oh no, not yet goodhusband (quoth she) in any case, least you should overthrow all thatis done. Stay but a little while, I will go in againe, and if allbee well, then will I call you. In went Agnesia againe, making thedoore fast after her, the Fryar having heard all the passedspeeches, by this time he was fitted with his habite, and taking thechilde in his armes, he said to Agnesia. Gossip methought I heard yourHusbands voice, is hee at your Chamber doore? Yes Gossip Reynard(quoth Credulano without, while Agnesia opened the doore, and admittedhim entrance) indeede it is I. Come in Sir, I pray you, replyed theFriar, and heere receive your childe of mee, who was in greatdanger, of your ever seeing him any more alive. But you must takeorder, to make an Image of waxe, agreeing with the stature of thechilde, to be placed on the Altar before the Image of S. Frances, bywhose merites the childe is thus restored to health.

　　The childe, beholding his Father, made signes of comming to him,rejoycing merrily, as yong infants use to do, and Credulano claspinghim in his armes, wept with conceite of joy, kissing him infinitely,and heartily thanking his Gossip Reynard, for the recovery of hisGod-son. The Friars brotherly Companion, who had given sufficientenstructions to the Nurse, and a small purse full of Sisters whitethred, which a Nunne (after shrift) had bestowed on him, upon thehusbands admittance into the Chamber (which they easily heard) came inalso to them, and seeing all in very good tearmes, they holpe tomake a joyfull conclusion, the Brother saying to Friar Reynard:Brother, I have finished all those foure jaculatory prayers, which youcommanded me.

　　Brother, answered Reynard, you have a better breath then I, and yoursuccesse hath prooved happier then mine, for before the arrivall of myGossip Credulano, I could accomplish but two jaculatory prayers onely.But it appeareth, that we have both prevailed in our devout desire,because the childe is perfectly cured. Credulano calling for Wineand good cheare, feasted both the Friars very jocondly, and thenconducting them forth of his house, without any furtherintermission, caused the childs Image of waxe to be made, and sentit to be placed on the Altar of Saint Frances, among many other thelike oblations.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS MANIFESTED, THAT THE MALICE AND SUBTILTY OF

　　WOMAN, SURPASSETH ALL THE ART OR WIT IN MAN

　　Tofano in the night season, did locke his wife out of his house, andshee not prevailing to get entrance againe, by all the entreatiesshe could possiblie use: made him beleeve that she had throwne herselfe into a Well, by casting a great stone into the same Well. Tofanohearing the fall of the stone into the Well, and being perswadedthat it was his Wife indeed; came forth of his house, and ran to theWelles side. In the meane while, his wife gotte into the house, madefast the doore against her Husband, and gave bim many reproachfullspeeches.

　　So soone as the King perceyved, that the Novell reported by MadameEliza was finished: hee turned himselfe to Madame Lauretta, and toldher as his pleasure, that she should now begin the next, whereto sheyeelded in this manner. O Love: What, and how many are thyprevailing forces? How straunge are thy foresights? And howadmirable thine attempts? Where is, or ever was the Philosopher orArtist, that could enstruct the wiles, escapes, preventions, anddemonstrations, which sodainly thou teachest such, as are thy aptand understanding Schollers indeede? Certaine it is, that thedocuments and eruditions of all other whatsoever, are weak, or of noworth, in respect of thine: as hath notably appeared, by theremonstrances already past, and whereto (worthy Ladies) I wil addeanother of a simple woman, who taught her husband such a lesson, asshee never learned of any, but Love himselfe.

　　There dwelt sometime in Arezzo (which is a faire Village of Tuscany)a rich man, named Tofano, who enjoyed in marriage a young beautifullwoman, called Cheta: of whom (without any occasion given, or reasonknowne to himselfe) he became exceeding- jealous. Which his wifeperceyving, she grew much offended thereat, and tooke it in greatscorne, that she should be servile to so vile and slavish a condition.Oftentimes, she demanded of him, from whence this jealousie in himreceived originall, he having never seene or heard of any; he couldmake her no other answer, but who his owne bad humour suggested, anddrove him every day (almost) to deaths doore, by feare of that whichno way needed. But, whether as a just scourge for this his grossefolly, or a secret decree, ordained to him by Fortune and the Fates, Iam not able to distinguish: It came so to passe, that a youngGallant made meanes to enjoy her favour, and she was so discreetlywise in judging of his worthinesse; that affection passed so farremutually betweene them, as nothing wanted, but effects to answerewords, suited with time and place convenient, for which order wastaken as best they might, yet to stand free from all suspition.

　　Among many other evill conditions, very frequent and familiar in herhusband Tofano; he tooke a great delight in drinking, which not onlyhe held to be a commendable quality, but was alwaies so oftensolicited thereto: that Cheta her selfe began to like and allow itin him, feeding his humor so effectually, with quaffing and carowsing,that (at any time when she listed) she could make him bowsie beyondeall measure: and leaving him sleeping in this drunkennesse, wouldalwayes get her selfe to bed. By helpe heereof, she compassed thefirst familiarity with her friend, yea, divers times after, asoccasion served: and so confidently did she builde on her husbandsdrunkennesse, that not onely shee adventured to bring her friendhome into her owne house; but also would as often go to his, which wassome-what neere at hand, and abide with him there, the most part ofthe night season.While Cheta thus continued on these amorous courses, it fortuned,that her slye suspitious husband, beganne to perceive, that thoughshee drunke very much with him, yea, untill he was quite spent andgone: yet she remained fresh and sober still, and therby imaginedstrange matters, that he being fast asleepe, his wife then tookeadvantage of his drowsinesse, and mightand so forth. Beeing desirousto make experience of this his distrust, hee returned home at night(not having drunke any thing all the whole day) dissembling both byhis words and behaviour, as if he were notoriously drunke indeede.Which his Wife constantly beleeving, saide to her selfe: That heehad now more neede of sleepe, then drinke; getting him immediatelyinto his warme bed; and then going downe the staires againe, softlywent out of doores unto her Friends house, as formerly she had used todo, and there shee remained untill midnight.

　　Tofano perceiving that his Wife came not to bed, and imagining tohave heard his doore both open and shut: arose out of his bed, andcalling his Wife Cheta divers times, without any answere returned: heewent downe the staires, and finding the doore but closed too, madeit fast and sure on the inside, and then got him up to the window,to watch the returning home of his wife, from whence shee came, andthen to make her conditions apparantly knowne. So long there hestayed, till at the last she returned indeede, and finding the dooreso surely shut, shee was exceeding sorrowful, essaying how she mightget it open by strength: which when Tofano had long suffered her invaine to approove, thus hee spake to her. Cheta, all thy labour ismeerely lost, because heere is no entrance allowed for thee; thereforereturn to the place from whence thou camest, that all thy friendsmay Judge of thy behaviour, and know what a night-walker thou artbecome.

　　The woman hearing this unpleasing language, began to use allhumble entreaties, desiring him (for charities sake) to open the dooreand admit her entrance, because she had not bin in any such place,as his jelous suspition might suggest to him: but onely to visit aweak and sickly neighbour, the nights being long, she not (as yet)capeable of sleepe, nor willing to sit alone in the house. But all herperswasions served to no purpose, he was so setled in his owneopinion, that all the Town should now see her nightly gading, whichbefore was not so much as suspected. Cheta seeing, that faire meaneswould not prevalle, shee entred into roughe speeches andthreatnings, saying: If thou wilt not open the doore and let me comein, I will so shame thee, as never base man was. As how I pray thee?answered Tofano, what canst thou do to me?

　　The woman, whom love had inspired with sprightly counsell,ingeniously enstructing her what to do in this distresse, stearnlythus replyed. Before I will suffer any such shame as thou intendesttowards mee, I will drowne my selfe heere in this Well before ourdoore, where being found dead, and thy villanous jealousie soapparantly knowne, beside thy more then beastly drunkennesse: allthe neighbours will constantly beleeve, that thou didst first strangleme in the house, and afterwardes threw me into this Well. So eitherthou must flie upon the supposed offence, or lose all thy goodes bybanishment, or (which is much more fitting for thee) have thy headsmitten off, as a wilfull murtherer of thy wife; for all will Judge itto be no otherwise. All which wordes, mooved not Tofano a jot from hisobstinat determination: but he still persisting therin, thus shespake. I neither can nor will longer endure this base Villanie ofthine: to the mercy of heaven I commit my soul, and stand there mywheele, a witnesse against so hard-hearted a murtherer.

　　No sooner had she thus spoke, but the night being so extreamly dark,as they could not discerne one another; Cheta went to the Well,where finding a verie great stone, which lay loose upon the brim ofthe Well, even as if it had beene layde there on purpose, shee criedout aloud, saying. Forgive me faire heavens, and so threw the stonedowne into the Well. The night being very still and silent, the fal ofthe great stone made such a dreadfull noise in the Well; that hehearing it at the Windowe, thought verily she had drowned her selfeindeede. Whereupon, running downe hastily, and taking a Bucketfastened to a strong Cord: he left the doore wide open, intendingspeedily to helpe her. But she standing close at the dooresentrance, before he could get to the Wels side; she was within thehouse, softly made the doore fast on the inside, and then went up tothe Window, where Tofano before had stood talking to her.

　　While he was thus dragging with his Bucket in the Well, crying andcalling Cheta, take hold good Cheta, and save thy life: she stoodlaughing in the Window, saying. Water should bee put into Winebefore a man drinkes it, and not when he hath drunke too much already.Tofano hearing his Wife thus to flout him out of his Window, went backto the doore, and finding it made fast against him: he willed hir togrant him entrance. But she, forgetting all gentle Language, whichformerly she had used to him: in meere mockery and derision (yetintermixed with some sighes and teares, which women are saide tohave at command) out aloud (because the Neighbours should heare her)thus she replyed.

　　Beastly drunken Knave as thou art, this night thou shalt not comewithin these doores, I am no longer able to endure thy base behaviour,it is more then high time, that thy course of life should beepubliquely known, and at what drunken houres thou returnest home tothy house. Tofano, being a man of very impatient Nature, was as bitterunto her in words on the other which the Neighbours about them (bothmen and Women) hearing; looked forth of their Windowes, and demaundinga reason for this their disquietnesse, Cheta (seeming as if shewept) sayde.

　　Alas my good Neighbours, you see at what unfitting houres, thisbad man comes home to his house, after hee hath lyen in a Taverneall day drunke, sleeping and snorting like a Swine. You are myhonest witnesses, how long I have suffered this beastlinesse in him,yet neyther your good counsell, nor my too often lovingadrionitions, can worke that good which wee have expected.Wherefore, to try if shame can procure any amendment, I have shuthim out of doores, until his drunken fit be over-past, and so he shallstand to coole his feet.

　　Tofano (but in very uncivill maner) told her being abroad thatnight, and how she had used him: But the Neighbours seeing her to bewithin the house, and beleeving her, rather then him, in regard of histoo well knowne ill qualities; very sharpely reproved him, gave himgrosse speeches, pittying that any honest Woman should be socontinually abused. Now my good Neighbours (quoth she) you see whatmanner of man he is. What would you thinke of me, if I should walk thestreets thus in the night time, or be so late out of mine ownehouse, as this dayly Drunkard is? I was affraid least you would havegiven credit to his dissembling speeches, when he told you, that I wasat the Welles side, and threw something into the Well: but that I knowyour better opinion of me, and how sildome I am to be seene out ofdoores, although he would induce your sharper judgement of me, and laythat shame upon me, wherein he hath sinned himselfe.

　　The Neighbours, both men and Women, were all very severelyincensed against Tofano, condemning him for his great fault that nightcommitted, and avouching his wife to be vertuous and honest. Withina little while, the noise passing from Neighbour to Neighbour, atthe length it came to the eares of her Kindred, who forthwith resortedthither, and hearing how sharpely the Neighbours reprehended Tofano:they tooke him, soundly bastanadoed him, and hardly left any bone ofhim unbruised. Afterward, they went into the house, tooke all suchthings thence as belonged to hir, taking hir also with them to theirdwelling, and threatning Tofano with further infliction of punishment,both for his drunkennesse, and causlesse jealousie.

　　Tofano perceyving how curstly they had handled him, and what crookedmeanes might further be used against him, in regard her Kindred andFriends were very mightie: thought it much better, patiently to sufferthe wrong alreadie done him, then by obstinate contending to proceedfurther, and fare worse. He became a suter to her Kindred, that almight be forgotten and forgiven, in recompence whereof; he would notonely refraine from drunkennesse, but also, never more be jelous ofhis wife. This being faithfully promised, and Cheta reconciled toher Husband, all strife was ended, she enjoyed her friends favour,as occasion served, but yet with such discretion, as it was not noted.Thus the Coxcombe foole, was faine to purchase his peace, after anotorious wrong sustained, and further injuries to bee offered.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　IN JUST SCORNE AND MOCKERY OF SUCH JEALOUS HUSBANDS, THAT WILL BE

　　SO IDLE HEADED UPON NO OCCASION. YET WHEN THEY HAVE GOOD REASON

　　FOR IT, DO LEAST OF ALL SUSPECT ANY SUCH INJURY

　　A jealous man, clouded with the habite of a Priest, became theConfessour to his owne Wife; who made him beleeve, that she wasdeepely in love with a Priest, which came every night, and lay withher. By meanes of which confession, while her jealous Husbandwatched the doore of his house; to surprize the Priest when he came:she that never meant to do amisse, had the company of a secret Friend,who came over the toppe of the house to visite her, while herfoolish Husband kept the doore.

　　Madam Lauretta having ended her Novell, and every one commendedthe Woman, for fitting Tofano in his kinde; and, as his jealousieand drunkennesse justly deserved: the King (to prevent all losse oftime) turned to Madame Fiammetta, commaunding her to follow next:whereuppon, very graciously, shee beganne in this manner.

　　Noble Ladies, the precedent Novell delivered by Madame Lauretta,maketh me willing to speake of another jealous man; as being halfeperswaded, that whatsoever is done to them by their Wives, andespecially upon no occasion given, they doe no more then wellbecommeth them. And if those grave heads, which were the firstinstituters of lawes, had diligently observed all things; I am ofthe minde, that they would have ordained no other penalty for Women,then they appointed against such, as (in their owne defence) do offendany other. For jealous husbands, are meere insidiators of theirWives lives, and most diligent pursuers of their deaths, being locktup in their houses all the Weeke long, imployed in nothing butdomesticke drudging affayres: which makes them desirous of highFestivall dayes, to receive some litle comfort abroad, by an honestrecreation or pastime, as Husbandmen in the fields, Artizans in ourCitie, or Governours in our judiciall Courtes; yea, or as our Lordhimselfe, who rested the seaventh day from all his travailes. Inlike manner, it is so willed and ordained by the Lawes, as well divineas humane, which have regard to the glory of God, and for the commongood of every one; making distinction betweene those dayes appointedfor labour, and the other determined for rest. Whereto jealous persons(in no case) will give consent, but all those dayes (which for otherwomen are pleasing and delightfull) unto such, over whom they command,are most irksome, sadde and sorrowful, because then they are lockt up,and very strictly restrained. And if question wer urged, how many goodwomen do live and consume away in this torturing het of affliction:I can make no other answere, but such as feele it, are best able todiscover it. Wherefore to conclude the proheme to my presentpurpose, let none be over rash in condemning women: for what they doto their husbands, being jealous without occasion; but rathercommend their wit and providence.

　　Somtime (faire Ladies) there lived in Arimino, a Merchant, very richin wealth and worldly possessions, who having a beautifull Gentlewomanto his wife, he became extreamly jelous of her. And he had no otherreason for this foolish conceit; but, like as he loved hir dearly, andfound her to be very absolutely faire: even so he imagined, thatalthogh she devised by her best meanes to give him content; yet otherswould grow enamored of her, because she appeared so amiable to al.In which respect, time might tutor her to affect some other besidehimselfe: the onely common argument of every bad minded man, beingweake and shallow in his owne understanding. This jelous humorincreasing in him more and more, he kept her in such narrow restraint:that many persons condemned to death, have enoyed larger libertie intheir imprisonment. For, she might not bee present at Feasts,Weddings, nor goe to Church, or so much as to be seen at her doore:Nay, she durst not stand in her Window, nor looke out of her house,for any occasion whatsoever. By means whereof, life seemed mosttedious and offensive to her, and she supported it the moreimpatiently, because shee knew her selfe not any way faulty.

　　Seeing her husband still persist in this shamefull course towardsher; she studied, how she might best comfort her selfe in thisdesolate case: by devising some one meane or other (if any at all wereto bee founde) wherby he might be requited in his kind, and wearthat badge of shame whereof he was now but onely affraid. Andbecause she could not gain so small a permission, as to be seene atany window, where (happily) she might have observed some one passingby in the street, discerning a litle parcell of her love: sheremembred at length, that, in the next house to her Husbands (theyboth joyning close together) there dwelt a comely yong properGentleman, whose perfections carried correspondencie with her desires.She also considered with her selfe, that if there were any partitionwall; such a chinke or cranny might easily be made therein, by which(at one time or other) she should gaine a sight of the youngGentleman, and finde an houre so fitting, as to conferre with him, andbestow her lovely favour on him, if he pleased to accept it. Ifsuccesse (in this case) proved answerable to her hope, then thus sheresolved to outrun the rest of her wearisome dayes, except the frensieof jealousie did finish her husbands loathed life before.

　　Walking from one roome to another, thorough every part of the house;and no wall escaping without diligent surveying; on a day, when herHusband was absent from home, she espyed in a corner very secret, anindifferent cleft in the Wall; which though it yeelded no full view onthe other side, yet she plainly perceived it to be an handsomeChamber, and grew more then halfe perswaded, that either it might bethe Chamber of Philippo (for so was the neighbouring yong Gentlemannamed) or else a passage guiding thereto. A Chambermaid of hers, whocompassioned her case very much; made such observance, by herMistresses direction, that she found it to be Philippoes bedChamber, and where alwayes he used to lodge alone. By often visitingthis rift or chinke in the Wall, especially when the Gentleman wasthere; and by throwing in little stones, flowers, and such likethings, which fell still in his way as he walked: so farre sheprevailed, that he stepping to the chinke, to know from whence theycame; shee called softly to him, who knowing her voyce, there they hadsuch private conference together, as was not any way displeasing toeither. So that the chinke being made a little larger; yet so, as itcould not be easily discerned: their mouthes might meete with kissestogether, and their hands folded each in other; but nothing else to beperformed, for continuall feare of her jelous husband.

　　Now the Feast of Christmasse drawing neere, the Gentlewoman saidto her Husband; that, if it stood with his liking: she would do suchduty as fitted with so solemne a time, by going earely in a morningunto Church, there to be confessed, and receive her Saviour, asother Christians did. How now? replied the jealous Asse, what sinneshave you committed, that should neede confession? How Husband? quothshe, what do you thinke me to be a Saint? Who knoweth not, I pray you,that I am as subject to sinne, as any other Woman living in the world?But my sins are not to be revealed to you, because you are noPriest. These words enflamed his jealousie more violently then before,and needes must he know what sinnes she had committed, and havingresolved what to do in this case, made her answer: That hee wascontented with her motion, alwaies provided, that she went to no otherChurch, then unto their owne Chappel, betimes in a morning; andtheir own Chaplaine to confesse her, or some other Priest by himappointed, but not any other: and then she to returne home presentlyagaine. She being a woman of acute apprehension, presently collectedhis whole intention: but seeming to take no knowledge thereof,replyed, that she would not swerve from his direction.

　　When the appointed day was come, she arose very earely, and beingprepared answerable to her owne liking, to the Chappell shee went asher Husband had appointed, where her jealous Husband (being muchearlier risen then she) attended for her comming: having so ordred thematter with his Chaplaine, that he was cloathed in his Cowle, with alarge Hood hanging over his eyes, that she should not know him, and sohe went and sate downe in the Confessors place. Shee being entred intothe Chappell, and calling for the Priest to heare her confession, hemade her answer: that he could not intend it, but would bring her toanother holy Brother, who was at better leysure then hee. So to herHusband he brought her, that seemed (in all respects) like theConfessor himselfe: save onely his Hood was not so closely veyled, butshee knew his beard, and said to her selfe. What a mad world is thiswhen jealousie can metamorphose an ordinary man into a Priest? But,let me alone with him, I meane to fit him with that which he lookesfor.

　　So, appearing to have no knowledge at all of him, downe she fellat his feete, and he had conveyed a few Cherry stones into hismouth, to trouble his speech from her knowledge; for, in all thingsels, he thoght himselfe to be sufficiently fitted for her. In thecourse of her confession, she declared, that she was married to a mostwicked jealous Husband, and with whom she lead a very hatefull life.Neverthelesse (quoth she) I am indifferently even with him, for I ambeloved of an Holie Fryar, that every night commeth and lyeth with me.When the jealous Husband heard this, it stabbed him like a dagger tothe heart, and, but for his greedy covetous desire to know more; hewould faine have broke off confession, and got him gone. But,perceiving that it was his wisest course, he questioned further withhis wife, saying: Why good Woman, doth not your husband lodge withyou? Yes Sir, quoth she. How is it possible then (replyed the Husband)that the Friar can lodge there with you too?

　　She, dissembling a farre fetcht sigh, thus answered. Reverend Sir, Iknow not what skilfull Art the Fryar useth, but this I am sure,every doore in our house will flye open to him, so soone as he dothbut touch it. Moreover, he told me, that when he commeth unto myChamber doore, he speaketh certaine words to himselfe, whichimmediately casteth my Husband into a dead sleepe, and,understanding him to bee thus sleepily entranced: he openeth thedoore, entreth in, lieth downe by me, and this every night hefaileth not to do. The jealous Coxcomb angerly scratching his head,and wishing his wife halfe hangd, said: Mistresse, this is verybadly done, for you should keepe your selfe from all men, but yourhusband onely. That shall I never doe, answered shee, because (indeed)I love him dearely. Why then (quoth our supposed Confessor) I cannotgive you any absolution. I am the more sory Sir, said she, I camenot hither to tell you any leasings, for if I could, yet I wouldnot, because it is not good to fable with such Saint-like men as youare. You do therein (quoth hee) the better, and surely I am verysory for you, because in this dangerous condition, it will bee theutter losse of your soule: neverthelesse, both for your husbandssake and your owne, I will take some paines, and use such especiallprayers in your name, which may (perchance) greatly avayle you. AndI purpose now and then, to send you a Novice or young Clearke of mine,whom you may safely acquaint with your minde, and signifie to me, byhim, whether they have done you good, or no: and if they provehelpefull, then will we further proceed therein. Alas Sir, said she,never trouble your selfe, in sending any body to our house; because,if my Husband should know it, he is so extreamly jealous, as all theworld cannot otherwise perswade him, but that he commeth thither forno honest intent, and so I shall live worse then now I do. Fear notthat, good woman, quoth he, but beleeve it certainly, that I will havesuch a care in this case, as your Husband shall never speake thereofto you. If you can doe so Sir, sayde she, proceed I pray you, and I amwell contented.

　　Confession being thus ended, and she receiving such pennance ashee appointed, she arose on her feete, and went to heare Masse;while our jealous Woodcocke (testily puffing and blowing) put offhis Religious habite, returning home presently to his house, beatinghis braines al the way as he went, what meanes he might best devise,for the taking of his wife and the Friar together, whereby to havethem both severely punished. His wife being come home from theChappell, discerned by her Husbands lookes, that he was like tokeepe but a sory Christmasse: yet he used his utmost industry, toconceale what he had done, and which she knew as well as himself.And he having fully resolved, to watch his own street doore the nextnight ensuing in person, in expectation of the Friars comming, saideto his Wife. I have occasion both to suppe and lodge out of my housethis night, wherefore see you the streete doore to be surely made faston the inside, and the doore at the middest of the staires, as alsoyour own Chamber doore, and then (in Gods name) get you to bed.Whereto she answered, that all should be done as hee had appointed.

　　Afterward, when she saw convenient time, she went to the chink inthe Wall, and making such a signe as shee was woont to doe:Phillippo came thither, to whom she declared all her morningsaffayres, and what directions her husband had given her. Furthermoreshe saide, certaine I am, that he will not depart from the house,but sit and watch the doore without, to take one that comes not heere.If therefore, you can climbe over the house top, and get in at ourgutter Window, you and I may conferre more familiarly together. Theyoung Gentleman being no dullard, had his lesson quickly taught him;and when night was come, Geloso (for so must wee tearme theCocke-braind husband) armes himselfe at all points, with a browne Billin his hand, and so he sits to watch his owne doore. His Wife had madefast all the doores, especially that on the midst of the stayres,because he should not (by any means) come to her Chamber; and so, whenthe houre served, the Gentleman adventured over the house top, foundthe gutter Window, and the way conducting him to her Chamber, whereI leave them to their further amorous conference.

　　Geloso, more than halfe mad with anger, first, because hee hadlost his supper: next, having sitten almost all the night (which wasextreamely cold and windle) his Armor much mollesting him, and yethe could see no Friar come: when day drew neere, and hee ashamed towatch there any longer; conveighed himselfe to some more convenientplace, where putting off his Armes, and seeming to come from the placeof his Lodging; about the ninth houre, he found his doore open, entredin, and went up the stayres, going to dinner with his Wife. Within awhile after, according as Geloso had ordred the businesse, a youthcame thither, seeming to be the Novice sent from the Confessor, and hebeing admitted to speake with her, demanded, whether shee weretroubled or mollested that night passed, as formerly she had bin,and whether the partie came or no? The Woman, who knew well enough theMessenger (notwithstanding all his formall disguise) made answer: Thatthe party expected, came not: but if hee had come, it was to nopurpose; because her minde was now otherwise altred, albeit shechanged not a jote from her amorous conclusion.

　　What should I now further say unto you? Geloso continued his watchmany nights afterward, as hoping to surprize the Friar at hisentrance, and his wife kept still her contented quarter, accordingas opportunitie served. In the conclusion, Geloso beeing no longerable to endire his bootlesse watching, nor some (more then ordinary)pleasing countenance in his wife: one day demaunded of her (with avery stearne and frowning brow) what secret sinnes shee had revealedto the ghostly Father, upon the day of her shrift? The Womanreplyed, that she would not tell him, neyther was it a matterreasonable, or lawfull for her to doe. Wicked Woman, answeredGeloso: I knowe them all well enough, even in despight of thee, andevery word that thou spakest unto him. But Huswife, now I must furtherknow, what the Fryar is, with whom you are so farre in love, and (bymeanes of his enchantments) lyeth with you every night; tell me whatand who he is, or else I meane to cut your throate.

　　The Woman immediately made answer, it was not true, that she wasin love with any Fryar. How? quoth Geloso, didst not thou confesseso much to the Ghostly Father, the other day when thou wast at shrift?No Sir, sayde she, but if I did, I am sure he would not disclose it toyou, except hee suffered you to bee there present, which is an Articlebeyonde his dutie. But if it were so, then I confesse freely, that Idid say so unto him. Make an end then quickely Wife (quoth Geloso) andtell mee who the Friar is. The Woman fell into a hearty laughter,saying. It liketh me singularly well, when a wise man will sufferhimselfe to be ledde by a simple Woman, even as a Sheepe is to theslaughter, and by the hornes. If once thou wast wise, that wisedomebecame utterly lost, when thou felst into that divellish frensie ofjealousie, without knowing anie reason for it: for, by thisbeastlike and no manly humor, thou hast eclipsed no meane part of myglory, and womanly reputation.

　　Doest thou imagine Husband, that if I were so blinded in the eyes ofmy head, as thou art in them which should informe thine understanding;I could have found out the Priest, that would needs bee myConfessor? I knew thee Husband to be the man, and therefore I preparedmy wit accordingly, to fit thee with the foolish imagination whichthou soughtest for, and (indeed) gave it thee. For, if thou hadstbeene wise, as thou makest the world to beleeve by outwardapparance, thou wouldest never have expressed such a basenesse ofminde, to borrow the coulour of a sanctified cloake, thereby toundermine the secrets of thine honest meaning Wife. Wherefore, tofeede thee in thy fond suspition, I was the more free in myConfession, and tolde thee truely, with whom, and how heinously Ihad transgressed. Did I not tell thee, that I loved a Fryar? And artnot thou he whom love, being a Fryar, and my ghostly Father, though(to thine owne shame) thou madst thy selfe so? I said moreover, thatthere is not any doore in our house, that can keepe it selfe shutagainst him, but (when he pleaseth) he comes and lies with me. Nowtell me Husband, What doore in our house hath (at any time) bin shutagainst thee, but they are freely thine owne, and grant thee entrance?Thou art the same Friar that confest me, and lieth every night withme, and so often as thou sentst thy yong Novice or Clearke to me, asoften did I truly returne thee word, when the same Fryar lay withme. But (by jealousie) thou hast so lost thine understanding, thatthou wilt hardly beleeve all this.

　　Alas good man, like an armed Watchman, thou satst at thine ownedoore all a cold Winters night, perswading mee (poorelly credulouswoman) that, upon urgent occasions, thou must needs suppe and lodgefrom home. Remember thy selfe therefore better heereafter, become atrue understanding man, as thou shouldst bee, and make not thy selfe amocking stocke to them, who knoweth thy jealous qualities, as wellas I do, and be not so watchfull over me, as thou art. For I sweare bymy true honesty, that if I were but as willing, as thou artsuspitious: I could deceive thee, if thou hadst an hundred eyes, asNature affords thee but two, and have my pleasures freely, yet thou benot a jot the wiser, or my credit any way impaired.

　　Our wonderfull wise Geloso, who (very advisedly) considred that hehad wholly heard his wives secret confession, and dreamed now on noother doubt beside, but (perceiving by her speeches) how hee wasbecome a scorne to al men: without returning other answer, confirmedhis wife to be both wise and honest, and now when he hadde justoccasion to be jealous indeede, hee utterly forsware it, and countedthem all Coxcombes that would be so misguided. Wherefore, she havingthus wisely wonne the way to her owne desires, and he reduced into amore humane temper: I hope there was no more neede, of clambringover houses in the night time like Cats, nor walking in at gutterWindowes; but all abuses were honestly reformed.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE SIXTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS MANIFESTLY DISCERNED, THAT IF LOVE BE DRIVEN TO A NARROW

　　STRAITE IN ANY OF HIS ATTEMPTS; YET HEE CAN

　　ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE BY SOME OTHER SUPPLY

　　Madame Isabella, delighting in the company of her affected Friend,named Lionello, and she being likewise beloved by SigniorLambertuccio: At the same time as shee had entertained Lionello,shee was also visited by Lambertuccio. Her Husband returning home inthe very instant; shee caused Lambertuccio to run forth with adrawne sword in his hand, and (by that meanes) made an excusesufficient for Lionello to her husband.

　　Wondrously pleasing to all the company, was the reported Novell ofMadame Fiammetta, every one applauding the Womans wisedome, and thatshe had done no more, then as the jealous foole her husband justlydeserved. But shee having ended, the King gave order unto MadamePampinea, that now it was her turne to speake, whereupon, thus shebegan. There are no meane store of people who say (though very falseand foolishly,) that Love maketh many to be out of their wits, andthat such as fall in Love, do utterly loose their understanding. Tomee this appeareth a very ydle opinion, as already hath beene approvedby the related discourses, and shall also bee made manifest by anotherof mine owne.

　　In our City of Florence, famous for some good, though as many badqualities, there dwelt (not long since) a Gentlewoman, endued withchoice beauty and admirable perfections, being wife to SigniorBeltramo, a very valiant Knight, and a man of great possessions. Asoftentimes it commeth to passe, that a man cannot alwayes feede on onekind of bread, but his appetite will be longing after change: so faredit with this Lady, named Isabella, she being not satisfied with thedelights of her Husband; grew enamoured of a young Gentleman, calledLionello, compleate of person and commendable qualities, albeit not ofthe fairest fortunes, yet his affection every way sutable to hers. Andfull well you know (faire Ladies) that where the mindes irreciprocallyaccorded, no dilligence wanteth for the desires execution: so thisamorous couple, made many solemne protestations, untill they shouldbee friended by opportunity.

　　It fortuned in the time of their hopefull expectation a Knight,named Signior Lambertuccio, fell likewise in love with Isabella: butbecause he was somewhat unsightly of person, and utterly unpleasing inthe eye, she grew regardlesse of his frequent solicitings, and wouldnot accept either tokens, or letters. Which when hee saw, (beingvery rich and of great power) hee sought to compasse his intent by acontrary course, threatning her with scandall and disgrace to herreputation, and with his associates to bandie against her bestfriends. She knowing what manner of man he was, and how able toabuse any with infamous imputations, wisely returned him hopefullpromises, though never meaning to performe any, but onely(Lady-like) to flatter and foole him therewith.

　　Some few miles distant from Florence, Beltramo had a Castle ofpleasure, and there his Lady Isabella used to live all Summer, asall other doe the like, being so possessed. On a day, Beltramo beingridden from home, and she having sent for Lionello, to take theadvantage of her Husbands absence; accordingly he went, not doubtingbut to winne what he had long expected. Signior Lambertuccio on theother side, meeting Beltramo riding from his Castle, and Isabellanow fit to enjoy his company: gallops thither with all possiblespeede, because hee would bee no longer delayed. Scarcely was Lionelloentred the Castle, and receiving directions by the waiting woman, toher Ladies Chamber: but Lambertuccio gallopped in at the Gate, whichthe woman perceiving, ranne presently and acquainted her Lady with thecomming of Lambertuccio.

　　Now was shee the onely sorrowfull woman of the world; for nothingwas now to bee feared, but stormes and tempests, because Lambertuccio,spake no other then Lightning and Thunder, and Lionello, (being nolesse affraide then shee) by her perswasion crept behind the bed,where he hid himselfe very contentedly. By this time Lambertucciowas dismounted from his Courser, which he fastened (by the bridle)to a ring in the wall, and then the waiting woman came to him, toguide him to her Lady and Mistresse: who stood ready at the staireshead, graced him with a very acceptable welcome, yet marvelling muchat his so sodaine comming. Lady (quoth he) I met your Husband upon theway, which granting mine accesse to see you; I come to claime yourlong delayed promise, the time being now so favourable for it.

　　Before he had uttered halfe these words, Beltramo, having forgotan especiall evidence in his Study, which was the onely occasion ofhis journey, came gallopping backe againe into the Castell Court,and seeing such a goodly Gelding stand fastened there, could notredily imagine who was the owner thereof. The waiting woman, uponthe sight of her Masters entring into the Court, came to her Lady,saying: My Master Beltramo is returned back?, newly alighted, and(questionlesse) comming up the staires. Now was our Lady Isabella, tentimes worse affrighted then before, (having two severall amouroussuters in her house, both hoping, neither speeding, yet her creditelying at the stake for either) by this unexpected returne of herHusband. Moreover, there was no possible meanes, for the concealing ofSignior Lambertuccio, because his Gelding stood in the open Court, andtherefore made a shrewde presumption against her, upon the leastdoubtfull question urged.

　　Neverthelesse, as womens wits are alwayes best upon suddenconstraints, looking forth of her window, and espying her Husbandpreparing to come up: she threw her selfe on her day Couch, speakingthus (earnestly) to Lambertuccio. Sir, if ever you loved mee, andwould have me faithfully to beleeve it, by the instant safety bothof your owne honour, and my life, doe but as I advise you. Forthdraw your Sword, and, with a stearne countenance, threatning death anddestruction: run downe the staires, and when you are beneath, say. Isweare by my best fortunes, although I misse of thee now heere, yetI will be sure to finde thee some where else. And if my Husbandoffer to stay you, or moove any question to you: make no otheranswere, but what you formerly spake in fury. Beside, so soone asyou are mounted on horsebacke, have no further conference with him,upon any occasion whatsoever; to prevent all suspition in him, ofour future intendments.

　　Lambertuccio sware many terrible oathes, to observe her directionsin every part, and having drawne forth his Sword, grasping it naked inhis hand, and setting worse lookes on the businesse, then evernature gave him, because he had spent so much labour in vaine; hefailed not in a jot of the Ladies injunction. Beltramo havingcommanded his horse to safe custody, and meeting Lambertucciodiscending downe the staires, so armed, swearing, and mostextreamely storming, wondring extraordinarily at his threatning words,made offer to imbrace him., and understand the reason of hisdistemper. Lambertuccio repulsing him rudely, and setting foote in thestirrup, mounted on his Gelding, and spake nothing else but this. Isweare by the fairest of all my fortunes, although I misse of theeheere: yet I will be sure to find thee some where else, and so hegallopped mainely away.

　　When Beltramo was come up into his wives Chamber, hee found her castdowne upon her Couch, weeping, full of feare, and greatlydiscomforted; wherefore he said unto her, What is hee that SigniorLambertuccio is so extreamely offended withall, and threatneth in suchimplacable manner? The Lady arising from her Couch, and going neere tothe Bed, because Lionello might the better heare her; returned herHusband this answere. Husband (quoth she) never was I so dreadfullyaffrighted till now; for, a young Gentleman, of whence, or what he is,I know not, came running into our Castle for rescue, being pursuedby Signior Lambertuccio, a weapon ready drawne in his hand.Ascending up our stayres, by what fortune, I know not, he found myChamber doore standing open, finding me also working on my Sampler,and in wonderfull feare and trembling.

　　Good Madame (quoth hee) for Gods sake helpe to save my life, or elseI shall be slaine heere in your Chamber. Hearing his pittious cry, andcompassionating his desperate case; I arose from my worke, and in mydemaunding of whence, and what he was, that durst presume so boldlyinto my bed-chamber: presently came up Signior Lambertuccio also, inthe same uncivill sorte, as before I tolde you, swaggering andswearing; where is this traiterous villaine? Heereupon, I stept(somewhat stoutly) to my Chamber doore, and as hee offered to enter,with a womans courage I resisted him, which made him so much enragedagainst mee, that when hee saw mee to debarre his entrance; after manyterrible and vile oathes and vowes, hee ranne downe the stayresagaine, in such like manner as you chaunced to meete him.

　　Now trust mee deare wife (said Beltramo) you behaved your selfe verywell and worthily: for, it would have beene a most notoriousscandall to us, if a man should bee slaine in your bed-chamber: andSignior Lambertuccio carryed himselfe most dishonestly, to pursueany man so outragiously, having taken my Castle as his Sanctuary.But alas wife, what is become of the poore affrighted Gentleman?Introth Sir (quoth she) I know not, but (somewhere or other)heereabout hee is hidden. Where art you honest friend" said plainemeaning Beltramo; Come forth and feare not, for thine enemy is gone.

　　Lionello, who had heard all the forepassed discourse, which shee haddelivered to her Husband Beltramo, came creeping forth amazedly (asone now very fearefully affrighted indeede) from under the furtherside of the bedde, and Beltramo saide to him, What a quarrell wasthis, between thee and furious Lambertuccio? Not any at all Sir,replyed Lionello, to my knowledge, which verily perswadeth me; thateither he is not well in his wits, or else he mistaketh me for someother; because, so soone as he saw me on the way, somewhat neere tothis your Castle, he drew forth hi Sword, and swearing an horribleoath, said. Traitor thou art a dead man. Upon these rough words, Istayed not to question the occasion of mine offending him: but fiedfrom him so fast as possibly I could; but confesse my selfe(indeede) over-bold, by presuming into your Ladies bed chamber,which yet (equalled with her mercie) hath bin the onely meanes at thistime, of saving my life She hath done like a good Lady, answeredBeltramo, and I do verie much commend her for it. But, recollect thydismayed spirits together, for I will see thee safely securedlience, afterward, looke to thy selfe so well as thou canst. Dinnerbeing immediately made ready, and they having merrily feastedtogether: he bestowed a good Gelding on Lionello, and rode alongwith him to Florence, where he left him quietly in his owne lodging.The selfe-same Evening (according as Isabella had given enstruction)Lionello conferred with Lambertuccio: and such an agreement passedbetweene them, that though some rough speeches were noised abroad,to set the better colour on the businesse; yet al matters were socleanly carried, that Beltramo never knew this queint deceitfullpolicy of his Wife.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREBY IS DECLARED, THAT SUCH AS KEEPE MANY HONEST SEEMING

　　SERVANTS, MAY SOMETIME FINDE A KNAVE AMONG THEM, AND ONE

　　THAT PROVES TO BE OVERSAWCY WITH HIS MASTER

　　Losovico discovered to his Mistresse Madame Beatrix, how amorouslyhe was affected to her. She cunningly sent Egano her Husband intohis garden, in all respects disguised like her selfe, while (friendly)Lodovico conferred with her in the meane while. Afterward, Lodovicopretending a lascivious allurement of his Mistresse, thereby towrong his honest Master, insted of her, beateth Egano soundly in theGarden.

　　This so sodaine dexterity of wit in Isabella, related in veriemodest manner by Madame Pampinea, was not onely admired by all thecompany; but likewise passed with as generall approbation. But yetMadam Philomena (whom the King had commanded next to succeede)peremptorily sayde. Worthy Ladies, if I am not deceived; I intend totell you another Tale presently; as much to be commended as the last.

　　You are to understand then, that it is no long while since, whenthere dwelt in Paris a Florentine Gentleman, who falling into decay ofhis estate, by over-bountifull expences; undertooke the degree of aMerchant, and thrived so well by his trading, that he grew to greatwealth, having one onely sonne by his wife, named Lodovico. ThisSonne, partaking somewhat in his Fathers former height of minde, andno way inclineable to deale in Merchandize, had no meaning to be aShopman, and therefore accompanied the Gentlemen of France, insundry services for the King; among whom, by his singular goodcarriage and qualites, he happened to be not meanly esteemed. Whilethus he continued in the Court, it chanced, that certaine Knights,returning from Jerusalem, having there visited the holy Sepulcher, andcomming into company where Lodovico was: much familiar discoursepassed amongst them, concerning the faire women of France, England,and other parts of the world where they had bin, and what delicatebeauties they had seene.

　　One in the company constantly avouched, that of all the Women bythem so generally observed, there was not any comparable to the Wifeof Egano de Galluzzi, dwelling in Bologna, and her name Madam Beatrix,reputed to be the onely faire woman of the world. Many of the restmaintained as much, having bin at Bologna, and likewise seene her.Lodovico hearing the woman to be so highly commended, and never (asyet) feeling any thought of amorous inclination; became sodainelytoucht with an earnest desire of seeing her, and his minde couldentertaine no other matter, but onely of travailing thither to seeher, yea, and to continue there, if occasion so served. The reason forhis journey urged to his Father, was to visit Jerusalem, and theholy Sepulcher, which with much difficulty, at length he obtainedhis leave.

　　Being on his journey towards Bologna, by the name of Anichino, andnot of Lodovico, and being there arrived; upon the day following,and having understood the place of her abiding: it was his good happe,to see the Lady at her Window; she appearing in his eye farre morefaire, then all reports had made her to be. Heereupon, his affectionbecame so enflamed to her, as he vowed, never to depart fromBologna, untill he had obtained her love. And devising by whatmeanes he might effect his hopes, he grew perswaded (setting all otherattempts aside) that if he could be entertained into her Husbandsservice, and undergo some businesse in the house, time might tutor himto obtaine his desire. Having given his attendants sufficientallowance, to spare his company, and take no knowledge of him, sellinghis Horses also, and other notices which might discover him: he grewinto acquaintance with the Hoste of the house where he lay,revealing an earnest desire in himselfe, to serve som Lord or worthyGentleman, if any were willing to give him entertainment.

　　Now beleeve me Sir (answered the Hoste) you seeme worthy to have agood service indeede, and I know a Noble Gentleman of this Cittie, whois named Egano: he will (without all question) accept your offer,for hee keepeth many men of verie good deserving, and you shall havemy furtherance therein so much as may be. As he promised, so heperformed, and taking Anichino with him unto Egano: so farre heprevailed by his friendly protestations, and good opinion of the youngGentleman; that Anichino was (without more ado) accepted in Eganoesservice, then which, nothing could be more pleasing to him. Now had hethe benefit of dayly beholding his hearts Mistresse, and so acceptableproved his service to Egano, that he grew very farre in love with him:not undertaking any affayres whatsoever, without the advice anddirection of Anichino, so that he reposed his most especiall trustin him, as a man altogether governed by him.

　　It fortuned upon a day, that Egano being ridden to flye his Hawke atthe River, and Anichino remaining behinde at home, Madame Beatrix, who(as yet) had taken no notice of Anichinoes love to her (albeit herselfe, observing his faire carriage and commendable qualities, washighly pleased to have so seeming a servant) called him to play at theChesse with her: and Anichino, coveting nothing more then to contenther, carried himselfe so dexteriously in the game, that he permittedhir still to win, which was no little joy to her. When all theGentlewomen, and other friends there present, as spectators tobehold their play, had taken their farewell, and were departed,leaving them all alone, yet gaming still: Anichino breathing forthan intire sigh, Madame Beatrix looking merrily on him, said. Tell meAnichino, art not thou angrie, to see me win? It should appeare soby that solemne sigh. No truly Madame, answered Anichino, a matterof farre greater moment, then losse of infinite games at the Chesse,was the occasion why I sighed. I pray thee (replyed the Lady) by thelove thou bearest me, as being my Servant (if any love at all remainin thee towards me) give me a reason for that harty sigh.

　　When he heard himselfe so severely conjured, by the love he bareto her, and loved none else in the world beside: he gave a farremore hart-sicke sigh, then before. Then his Lady and Mistresseentreated him seriously, to let her know the cause of those twodeepe sighes: whereto Anichino thus replyed. Madam, if I should tellyou, I stand greatly in feare of offending you: and when I have toldyou, I doubt your discovery thereof to some other. Beleeve me Anichino(quoth she) therein thou neither canst, or shalt offend me.Moreover, assure thy selfe, that I will never disclose it to anyother, except I may do it with thy consent. Madame (saide hee)seeing you have protested such a solemne promise to mee, I willreveale no meane secret unto you.

　　So, with teares standing in his eyes, he told her what he was; wherehe heard the first report of her singular perfections, and instantlybecam enamored of her, as the maine motive of his entring into herservice. Then, most humbly he entreated her, that if it might agreewith her good liking, she would be pleased to commisserate his case,and grace him with her private favours. Or, if shee might not be somercifull to him; that yet she would vouchsafe, to let him live in thelowly condition as he did, and thinke it a thankefull duty in him,onely to love her. O singular sweetnesse, naturally living in fairefeminine blood! How justly art thou worthy of praise in the likeoccasions? Thou couldst never be wonne by sighes and teares; buthearty imprecations have alwayes prevailed with thee, making theeapt and easie to amorous desires. If I had praises answerable to thygreat and glorious deservings, my voice should never faint, nor my penwaxe weary, in the due and obsequious performance of them.

　　Madam Beatrix, well observing Anichino when he spake, and givingcredit to his so solemne protestations; they were so powerfull inprevailing with her, that her senses (in the same manner) wereenchanted; and sighes flew as violently from her, as before he hadvented them: which stormy tempest being a little over-blowne, thus shespake. Anichino, my hearts deere affected Friend, live in hope, forI tell thee truly, never could gifts, promises, nor any Courtings usedto me by Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, or other (although I have binsolicited by many) winne the lest grace or favour at my hand, no,nor move me to any affection. But thou, in a minute of time(compared with their long and tedious suing) hast expressed such asoveraigne potency in thy sweet words, that thou hast made me morethine, then mine owne: and beleeve it unfeinedly, I hold thee to beworthy of my love. Wherefore, with this kisse I freely give it thee,and make thee a further promise, that before this night shall be fullypast, thou shalt in better manner perceive it. Adventure into myChamber about the houre of midnight, I will leave the doore open: thouknowest on which side of the bed I use to rest, come thither and fearenot: if I sleep, the least gentle touch of thy hand will wake me,and then thou shalt see how much I love thee. So, with a kinde kisseor two, the bargaine was concluded, she licensing his departure forthat rime, and he staying in hope of his hearts happinesse, till when,he thought every houre a yeare.

　　In the meane while; Egano returned home from Hawking, and so sooneas he had supt (being very weary) he went to bed, and his Ladielikewise with him, leaving her Chamber doore open, according as shehad promised. At the houre appointed, Anichino came, finding the doorebut easily put too, which (being entred) softly he closed againe, inthe same manner as he found it. Going to the beds side where theLady lay, and gently touching her brest with his hand, he found her tobe awake, and perceiving he was come according unto promise, sheecaught his hand fast with hers, and held him very strongly. Then,turning (as she could) towards Egano, she made such meanes, as heeawaked, whereupon she spake unto him as followeth.

　　Sir, yesternight I would have had a fewe speeches with you: but,in regard of your wearinesse and early going to bed, I could nothave any opportunity. Now, this time and place being mostconvenient, I desire to bee resolved by you: Among all the menretained into your service; which of them do you thinke to be thebest, most loyall, and worthiest to enjoy your love? Egano answeredthus: Wife, why should you move such a question to me? Do not youknow, that I never had any servant heeretofore, or ever shall haveheereafter, in whom I reposed the like trust as I have done, and do inAnichino? But to what end is this motion of yours? I will tell you Sir(quoth she) and then be Judge your self, whether I have reason to movethis question, or no. Mine opinion every way equalled yours,concerning Anichino, and that he was more just and faithfull to you,then any could be amongest all the rest: But Husband, like as wherethe water runneth stillest, the Foord is deepest, even so, hissmooth lookes have beguiled both you and me. For, no longer agoe, thenthis verie day, no sooner were you ridden foorth on Hauking, but he(belike purposely) tarrying at home, watching such a leysure as bestfitted his intent: was not ashamed to solicite mee, both to abuse yourbed, and mine owne spotlesse honor.

　　Moreover, he prosecuted his impious purpose with such alluringperswasions: that being a weake woman, and not willing to endureover many Amorous proofes (onely to acquaint you with his mostsawcie immodestie, and to revenge your selfe uppon him as best youmay; your selfe beeing best able to pronounce him guiltie) I madehim promise, to meete him in our Garden, presently aftermidde-night, and to finde mee sitting under the Pine-Tree; nevermeaning (as I am vertuous) to be there. But, that you may know thedeceite and falshoode of your Servant, I would have you to put on myNight-gowne, my head Attire, and Chinne-cloath, and sitting but ashort while there underneath the Pine-Tree: such is his insatiatedesire, as he will not faile to come, and then you may proceede, asyou finde occasion.

　　When Egano heard these Words, sodainely hee started out of Bed,saying. Doe I foster such a Snake in mine owne bosome? GramercieWife for this politicke promise of thine, and beleeve mee, I meaneto follow it effectually. So, on he put his Ladies Night-gown, herformall head Attire and Chin-cloth, going presently downe into theGarden, to expect Anichinoes comming to the Pine-Tree. But beforethe matter grew to this issue, let me demand of you faire Ladies, inwhat a lamentable condition (as you may imagine) was poore Anichino;to bee so strongly detained by her, heare all his amorous suitediscovered, and likely to draw very heavy afflictions on him?Undoubtedly, he looked for immediate apprehension by Egano,imprisonment and publike punishment for his so malapert presumption:and had it proved so, she had much renowned her selfe, and dealtwith him but as he had justlie deserved.

　　But frailtie in our feminine sex is too much prevalent, and makes uswander from vertuous courses, when we are wel onward in the way tothem. Madam Beatrix, whatsoever passed betweene her and Anichino, Iknow not, but, either to continue this new begunne league forfurther time, or, to be revenged on her husbands implicity, inover-rashlie giving credit to so smooth a ly; this was her advise tohim. Anichino, quoth she, Take a good Cudgell in thy hand, then gointo the Garden so farre as the Pine; and there, as if formerly thouhadst solicited mee unto this secret meeting, only but by way ofapproving my honestie: in my name, revile thy master so bitterly asthou canst, bestowing manie sound blowes on him with thy cudgel; yeturge the shame stil (as it were) to mee, and never leave him, til thouhast beaten him out of the garden, to teach him keepe his bedanother time Such an apt Scholler as Anichino was in this kind,needs no tutoring, but a word is enough to a ready Wit. To theGarden goes he, with a good willow cudgell in his hand, and commingneere to the Pine-tree, there he found Egano disguised like to hisLady, who arising from the place where he sate, went with chearefullgesture to welcome him; but Anichino (in rough and stearne manner)thus spake unto him. Wicked shamelesse, and most immodest Woman, Artthou come, according to thine unchaste and lascivious promise?Couldest thou so easily credite, (though I tempted thee, to trie thevertue of thy continencie) I would offer such a damnable wrong to myworthy Master, that so deerely loves me, and reposeth his especiallconfidence in me? Thou art much deceived in me, and shalt finde,that I hate to be false to him.

　　So lifting up the Cudgell, he gave him therewith halfe a scoregood bastinadoes, laying them on soundly, both on his armes andshoulders: and Egano feeling the smart of them, durst not speake oneWorde, but fled away from him so fast as hee could, Anichino stillfollowing, and multiplying many other injurious speeches againsthim, with the Epithites of Strumpet, lustfull and insatiate Woman.Go thou lewde beast (quoth he) most unworthy the title of a Lady, orto be Wife unto so good a natured man, as my Mayster is, to whom Iwill reveale thy most ungracious incivility to Morrow, that he maypunish thee a little better then I have done.

　　Egano being thus well beaten for his Garden walke, got within thedoore, and so went up to his Chamber againe: his Lady theredemanding of him, whether Anichino came according to his promise, orno? Come?

　　quoth Egano, Yes Wife, he came, but deerely to my cost: for heeverily taking me for thee, hath beaten me most extreamly, calling mean hundred Whores and Strumpets, reputing thee to bee the wickedstWoman living. In good sadnesse Beatrix, I wondred not a little at him,that he would give thee any such vile speeches, with intent to wrongmee in mine honour. Questionlesse, because hee saw thee to bejoviall spirited, gracious and affable towardes all men; therefore heeintended to make triall of thine honest carriage. Well Sir (saydeshee) twas happy that hee tempted mee with words, and let you tastethe proofe of them by deeds: and let him thinke, that I brooke thosewords as distastably, as you do or can, his ill deeds. But seeing heis so just, faithfull, and loyall to you, you may love him the better,and respect him as you finde occasion.

　　Whereto Egano thus replyed. Now trust me thou hast said very well:And me wi drawing hence the argument of his setled perswasion; that hehad the chastest Woman living to his wife, and so just a Servant, ascould not be fellowed: there never was any further discoverie ofthis Garden-night accident. Perhaps, Madame Beatrix and Anichino mightsubtilly smile thereat in secret, in regard that they knew more thenany other else beside did. But, as for honest meaning Egano, hee neverhad so much as the verie least mistrust of ill dealing, either inhis Lady, or Anichino; whom hee loved and esteemed farre morerespectively uppon this proofe of his honestie towards him, then heewould or could possibly have done, without a triall so playne andpregnant.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE EIGHT NOVELL

　　WHEREBY APPEARETH, THAT AN HUSBAND OUGHT TO BE VERY WELL ADVISED,

　　WHEN HE MEANETH TO DISCOVER ANY WRONG OFFERED HIS WIFE; EXCEPT

　　HEE HIM-SELFE DO RASHLY RUN INTO ALL THE SHAME AND REPROACH

　　Arriguccio Berlinghieri, became immeasurably jelous of his WifeSimonida, who fastened a thred about her great toe, for to serve asa small, when her amorous friend should come to visite her. Arrigucciofindeth the fallacie, and while he pursueth the amorous friend, sheecauseth her Maide to lye in her bed against his returne: whom hebeateth extreamly, cutting away the lockes of her haire (thinking hehad doone all this violence to his wife Simonida:) and afterwardfetcheth her Mother and Brethren, to shame her before them, and sobe rid of her. But they finding all his speeches to be utterlyfalse; and reputing him to bee a drunken jealous foole; all theblame and disgrace falleth on himselfe.

　　It seemed to the whole assembly, that Madam Beatrix, dealte somewhatstrangely, in the manner of beguiling her husband; and affirmedalso, that Anichino had great cause of fear, when she held him sostrongly by her beds side, and related all his amorous temptation. Butwhen the King perceyved, that Madame Philomena sate silent, heturned to Madam Neiphila, willing her to supply the next place; whomodestly smiling, thus began.

　　Faire Ladies, it were an heavy burthen imposed on me, and a mattermuch surmounting my capacity, if I should vainely imagine, tocontent you with so pleasing a Novell, as those have already done,by you so singularly reported: neverthelesse, I must discharge mydutie, and take my fortune as it fals, albeit I hope to finde youmercifull.

　　You are to know then, that sometime there lived in our Citie, a verywelthy Merchant, named Arriguccio Berlinghieri, who (as many Merchantshave done) fondly imagined, to make himselfe a Gentleman bymarriage. Which that he might the more assuredly do, he took to wife aGentlewoman, one much above his degree or element, she being namedSimonida. Now, in regard that he delighted (as it is the usuall lifeof a Merchant) to be often abroad, and little at home, whereby sheehad small benefit of his company; shee grew very forward inaffection with a young Gentleman, called Signior Roberto, who hadsolicited hir by many amorous meanes, and (at length) prevailed to winher favor. Which favour being once obtained; affection gaddes so farrebeyond al discretion, and makes Lovers so heedelesse of theirprivate conversations: that either they are taken tardy in theirfolly, or else subjected to scandalous suspition.

　　It came to passe, that Arriguccio, either by rumour, or some othermore sensible apprehension, had received such intelligenceconcerning his Wife Simonida, as he grew into extraordinarie jealousieof her, refraining travaile abroad, as formerly he was wont to doe,and ceassing from his verie ordinary affayres, addicting all hiscare and endeavour, onely to be watchfull of his Wife; so that henever durst sleepe, untill she were by him in the bed, which was nomeane mollestation to her, being thus curbd from her familiar meetingswith Roberto. Neverthelesse, having a long while consulted with herwittes, to find some apte meanes for conversing with him, beingthereto also very earnestlie still solicited by him; you shall hearewhat course she undertooke.

　　Her Chamber being on the streete side, and somewhat juttying overit, she observed the disposition of her Husband, that every night itwas long before he fell asleepe: but beeing once falne into it, nonoyse whatsoever, could easily wake him. This his solemne and soundsleeping, emboldned her so farre, as to meete with Roberto at thestreete doore, which (while her Husband slept) softly she would opento him, and therein private converse with him.

　　But, because shee would know the certaine houre of his comming,without the least suspition of any: she hung a thred forth of herChamber Window, descending downe, within the compasse of Robertoesreach in the street, and the other end thereof, guided from the Windowto the bed, being conveyed under the Cloathes, and shee being inbed, she fastned it about her left great Toe, wherewith Roberto wassufficiently acquainted, and thus enstructed withall; that at hiscomming, he should plucke the thred, and if her husband was in hisdead sleep, she would let go the thred, and come downe to him: butif he slept not, she would hold it strongly, and then his tarryingwould prove but in vaine, there could be no meeting that night.

　　This devise was highly pleasing both to Roberto and Simonida,being the intelligencer of their often meeting, and many times alsoadvising the contrary. But in the end, as the quaintest cunning mayfaile at one time or other; so it fortuned one night, that Simonidabeing in a sound sleepe, and Arriguccio waking, because his drowsiehoure was not yet come: as he extendeth forth his legge in the bed, hefound the thred, which feeling in his hand, and perceiving it was tyedto his wives great toe; it prooved apt tinder to kindle furtherjealousie, and now hee suspected some treachery indeede, and so muchthe rather because the thred guided (under the cloathes) from thebed to the window, and there hanging downe into the streete, as awarning to some further businesse.

　　Now was Arriguccio so furiously enflamed, that hee must needes beefurther resolved in this apparant doubt: and because therein hee wouldnot be deceived, softly he cut the thred from his wives toe, andmade it fast about his owne; to trye what successe would ensuethereon. It was not long before Roberto came, and according as heeused to doe, hee pluckt the thred, which Arriguccio felt, butbecause hee had not tyed it fast, and Roberto pulling itover-hardly, it fell downe from the window into his hand, which heunderstood as his lesson, to attend her comming, and so hee did.Arriguccio stealing softly out of bed from his wife, and taking hisSword under his arme, went downe to the doore, to see who it was, withfull intent of further revenge. Now, albeit he was a Merchant, yethe wanted not courage, and boldnesse of spirit, and opening thedoore without any noyse, onely as his wife was wont to doe: Roberto,there waiting his entrance, perceived by the doores unfashionableopening, that it was not Simonida, but her Husband, whereupon hebetooke himselfe to flight and Arriguccio fiercely followed him. Atthe length, Roberto perceiving that flight avayled him not, becausehis enemy still pursued him: being armed also with a Sword, asArriguccio was; he returned backe upon him, the one offering tooffend, as the other stood upon his defence, and so in the darkethey fought together.

　　Simonida awaking, even when her Husband went foorth of theChamber, and finding the thred to be cut from her toe; conjecturedimmediately, that her subtle cunning was discovered, and supposing herHusband in pursuite of Roberto, presently she arose; and,considering what was likely to ensue thereon, called her Chamber-maide(who was not ignorant of the businesse) and by perswasions prevailedso with her, that she lay downe in her place in the bed, uponsolemne protestations and liberall promises, not to make her selfeknowne, but to suffer all patiently, either blowes, or other ill usageof her Husband, which shee would recompence in such bountifull sort,as she should have no occasion to complaine. So, putting out thewatchlight, which every night burned in the Chamber, she departedthence, and sate downe in a close corner of the house, to see whatwould be the end of all this stirre, after her Husbands comming home.

　　The fight (as you have formerly heard) continuing betweene Robertoand Arriguccio, the neighbours hearing of the clashing of their Swordsin the streets; arose out of their beds, and reproved them in veryharsh manner. In which respect Arriguccio, fearing to be knowne, andignorant also what his adversary was (no harme being as yet done oneither side) permitted him to depart; and extreamely full of anger,returned backe againe to his house. Being come up into hisbed-chamber, thus he began; Where is this lewde and wicked woman?what? hast thou put out the light, because I should not finde thee?that shall not avayle thee, for I can well enough finde a drab inthe darke. So, groping on to the beds side, and thinking hee had takenholde on his wife, he grasped the Chamber-maide, so beating her withhis fists, and spurning her with his feet, that al her face was bloodyand bruised. Next, with his knife he cut off a great deal of herhaire, giving her the most villanous speeches as could be devised:swearing, that he would make her a shame to all the world.

　　You need make no doubt, but the poore maide wept exceedingly, as shehad good occasion to doe: and albeit many times she desired mercy, andthat hee would not bee so cruell to her: yet notwithstanding, hervoyce was so broken with crying, and his impacience so extreame,that rage hindered all power of distinguishing, or knowing his wivestongue from a strangers. Having thus madly beaten her, and cut thelockes off from her head, thus he spake to her. Wicked woman, and nowife of mine, be sure I have not done with thee yet; for, although Imeane not now to beate thee any longer: I will goe to thy brethren,and they shall understand thy dishonest behaviour. Then will I bringthem home with me, and they perceiving how much thou hast abusedboth their honour and thine owne; let them deale with thee as theyfinde occasion, for thou art no more a companion for me. No sooner hadhe uttered these angry words, but hee went forth of the Chamber,bolting it fast on the outward side, as meaning to keepe her safelyinclosed, and out of the house he went alone by himselfe.

　　Simonida, who had heard all this tempestuous conflict, perceivingthat her Husband had lockt the streete doore after him, and was gonewhether he pleased: unbolted the Chamber doore, lighted a waxe candle,and went in to see her poore maide, whom she found to be mostpittifully misused. She comforted her as well as she could, broughther into her owne lodging Chamber, where washing her face and hurts invery soveraigne waters, and rewarding her liberally withArriguccioes owne Gold; she held her selfe to be sufficientlysatisfyed. So, leaving the maide in her lodging, and returning againto her owne Chamber: she made up the bed in such former manner, asif no body had lodged therein that night. Then hanging up her Lampefresh fild with oyle, and clearly lighted, she deckt her selfe in sodecent sort, as if she had bin in no bed all that night.

　　Then taking sowing worke in her hand, either shirts or bands ofher Husbands; hanging the Lampe by her, and sitting downe at thestayres head, she fell to worke in very serious manner, as if shee hadundertaken some imposed taske.

　　On the other side, Arriguccio had travelled so farre from his house,till he came at last to the dwelling of Simonidaes brethren: where heeknockt so soundly, that he was quickely heard, and (almost asspeedily) let in. Simonidaes brethren, and her mother also, hearing ofArriguccioes comming thither so late. Rose from their beds, and eachof them having a Waxe Candle lighted, came presently to him, tounderstand the cause of this his so unseasonable visitation.Arriguccio, beginning at the originall of the matter, the thredfound tyed about his wives great toe, the fight and housholdconflict after following: related every circumstance to them. Andfor the better proofe of his words, he shewed them the thred it selfe,the lockes supposed of his wives haire, and adding withall; thatthey might now dispose of Simonida as themselves pleased, becauseshe should remaine no longer in his house.

　　The brethren to Simonida were exceedingly offended at this relation,in regard they beleeved it for truth, and in this fury, commandedTorches to be lighted, preparing to part thence with Arriguccio hometo his house, for the more sharpe reprehension of their Sister.Which when their mother saw, she followed them weeping, firstentreating one, and then the other, not to be over rash in creditingsuch a slander, but rather to consider the truth thereof advisedly:because the Husband might be angry with his Wife upon some otheroccasion, and having outraged her, made this the meanes in excuse ofhimselfe. Moreover she said, that she could not chuse but wondergreatly, how this matter should thus come to passe: because she hadgood knowledge of her daughter, during the whole course of hereducation, faultlesse and blamelesse in every degree; with manyother good words of her beside, as proceeding from naturallaffection of a mother.

　　Being come to the house of Arriguccio, entring in, and ascendingup the stayres: they heard Simonida sweetly singing at her working;but pausing, upon hearing their rude trampling, shee demaunded, whowas there. One of the angry brethren presently answered: Lewde womanas thou art, thou shalt know soone enough who is heere: Our blessedLady be with us (quoth Simonida) and sweet Saint Frances helpe todefend me, who dare use such unseemely speeches? Starting up andmeeting them on the staire head: Kinde brethren, (said she) is it you?What, and my loving mother too? For sweet Saint Charities sake, whatmay be the reason of your comming hither in this manner. Shee beingset downe againe to her worke, so neatly apparelled, without any signeof outrage offered her, her face unblemished, her haire comelyordered, and differing wholly from the former speeches of her Husband:the Brethren marvelled thereat not a little; and asswaging somewhatthe impetuous torrent of their rage, began to demaund in cooleblood, (as it were) from what ground her Husbands complaintsproceeded, and threatning her roughly, if she would not confesse thetruth intirely to them.

　　Ave Maria (quoth Simonida, crossing her selfe) Alas deareBrethren, I know not what you say, or meane, nor wherein my Husbandshould bee offended, or make any complaint at all of me. Arrigucciohearing this looked on her like a man that had lost his Senses: forwell he remembred, how many cruell blowes he had given her on theface, beside scratches of his nailes, and spurnes of his feet, as alsothe cutting of her haire, the least shew of all which misusage, wasnot now to be seene. Her brethren likewise briefly told her, the wholeeffect of her Husbands speeches, shewing her the thred, and in whatcruell manner he sware hee did beate her. Simonida, turning then toher Husband, and seeming as confounded with amazement, said. How isthis Husband? what doe I heare? would you have me supposed (to yourowne shame and disgrace) to be a bad woman, and your selfe a cruellcurst man, when (on either side) there is no such matter? When wereyou this night heere in the house with mee? Or when should you beatemee, and I not feele nor know it? Beleeve me (sweete heart) allthese are meerely miracles to me.

　　Now was Arriguccio ten times more mad in his minde, then before,saying. Divell, and no woman, did wee not this night goe both togetherto bed? Did not I cut this thred from thy great toe, tyed it tomine, and found the craftie compact betweene thee and thy Minnion? Didnot I follow and fight with him in the streets? Came I not backeagaine, and beate thee as a Strumpet should be? And are not thesethe locks of haire, which I my selfe did cut from thy bead?

　　Alas Sir (quoth she) where have you been? doe you know what you say?you did not lodge in this house this night, neither did I see youall the whole day and night, till now.

　　But leaving this, and come to the matter now in question, becauseI have no other testimony then mine owne words. You say, that youdid beate me, and cut those lockes of haire from my head. Alas Sir,why should you slander your selfe? In all your life time you did neverstrike me. And to approve the truth of my speeches, doe you yourselfe, and all else heere present, looke on me advisedly, if any signeof blow or beating is to be seene on me. Nor were it an easie matterfor you to doe either to smite, or so much as lay your hand (in anger)on me, it would cost dearer then you thinke for. And whereas yousay, that you did cut those lockes of haire from my head; it is morethen either I know, or felt, nor are they in colour like to mine: but,because my Mother and brethren shall be my witnesses therein, andwhether you did it without my knowledge; you shall all see, if they becut, or no. So, taking off her head attyre, she displayed her hayreover her shoulders, which had suffered no violence, neither seemedto bee so much as uncivilly or rudely handled.

　　When the mother and brethren saw this, they began to murmure againstArriguccio, saying. What thinke you of this Sir? you tell us ofstrange matters which you have done, and all proving false, wewonder how you can make good the rest. Arriguccio looked wilde, andconfusedly, striving still to maintaine his accusation: but seeingevery thing to bee flatly against him, he durst not attempt tospeake one word. Simonida tooke advantage of this distraction inhim, and turning to her brethren, saide. I see now the marke whereathe aymeth, to make me doe what I never meante: Namely, that I shouldacquaint you with his vile qualities, and what a wretched life I leadewith him, which seeing hee will needes have me to reveale; bearewith me if I doe it upon compulsion.

　　Mother and Brethren, I am verily perswaded, that those accidentswhich he disclosed to you, hath doubtlesse (in the same manner)happened to him, and you shall heare how. Very true it is, that thisseeming honest man, to whom (in a lucklesse houre) you married me,stileth himselfe by the name of a Merchant, coveting to be soaccounted and credited, as holy in outward appearance, as aReligious Monke, and as demure in lookes, as the modestest Maide: likea notorious common drunkard, is a Taverne hunter, where making hisluxurius matches, one while with one Whore, then againe withanother; hee causeth mee every night to sit tarrying for him, evenin the same sort as you found me: sometimes till midnight, andotherwhiles till broad day light in the morning.

　　And questionlesse, being in his wounted drunken humour, hee hathlyen with one of his sweet Consorts, about whose toe he found thethred, and finding her as false to him, as he hath alwayes been to me:Did not onely beat her, but also cut the haire from her head. Andhaving not yet recovered his sences, is verily perswaded, and cannotbe altered from it; but that hee performed all this villany to me. Andif you doe but advisedly observe his countenance, he appeareth yetto be more then halfe drunke.

　　But whatsoever he hath said concerning me, I make no account atall thereof, because he spake it in his drunkennesse, and as freely asI forgive him, even so (good Mother and kinde Brethren,) let meeentreate you to do the like.

　　When the Mother had heard these words, and confidently beleevedher Daughter: she began to torment her selfe with anger, saying. Bythe faith of my body Daughter, this unkindnesse is not [to] beendured, but rather let the dogge be hanged, that his qualities may beknowne, he being utterly unworthy, to have so good a woman to hiswife, as thou art. What could he have done if he had taken thee in theopen more, and in company of some wanton Gallants? In an unfortunatehoure wast thou married to him, base jealous Coxecombe as he is, andit is quite against sense, or reason, that thou shouldest be subjectto his fooleries. What was hee, but a Merchant of Eale-skinnes orOrenges, bred in some paltry countrey village; taken fromHogge-rubbing; clothed in Sheepes-Sattin, with Clownish Startops,Leather stockings, and Caddies garters: His whole habite not worththree shillings: And yet he must have a faire Gentlewoman to his Wife,of honest fame, riches and reputation; when, comparing his pedegreewith hers, hee is farre unfit to wipe her shooes.

　　Oh my deare sonnes, I would you had followed my counsell, andpermitted her to mate in the honourable family of Count Guido, whichwas much mooved, and seriously pursued. But you would needs bestow heron this goodly jewell; who, although shee is one of the choysestbeauties in Florence, chaste, honest and truely vertuous: Is notashamed at midnight, to proclaime her for a common whore, as if we hadno better knowledge of her. But by the blessed mother of Saint John,if you would be ruled by mine advise; our law should make himdearely smart for it.

　　Alas my sonnes, did I not tell you at home in our owne house, thathis words were no way likely to prove true? Have not your eyesobserved his unmannerly behaviour to your Sister? If I were as youare, hearing what he hath said, and noting his drunken carriagebeside; I should never give over, as long as he had any life left inhim. And were I a man, as I am a woman, none other then my selfeshould revenge her wrongs, making him a publike spectacle to alldrabbing drunkards.

　　When the brethren had heard and observed all these occurrences; inmost bitter manner they railed on Arriguccio, bestowing some goodbastinadoes on him beside, concluding thus with him in the end.Quoth one of them, Wee will pardon this shamefull abusing of ourSister, because thou art a notorious drunkard: but looke to it (onperill of thy life) that we have no more such newes hereafter; for,beleeve it unfainedly, if any such impudent rumours happen to oureares, or so much as a flying fame thereof; thou shalt surely be paidefor both faults together.

　　So home againe went they, and Arriguccio stood like one that hadneither life or motion, not knowing (whether what he had done) wastrue, or no, or if he dreamed all this while, and so (without utteringany word) he left his Wife, and went quietly to bed. Thus by herwisdome, she did not onely prevent an imminent perill: but also made afree and open passage, to further contentment with her amourousfriend, yet dreadlesse of any distaste or suspition in her Husband.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THAT GREAT LORDS MAY SOMETIME BE DECEIVED BY

　　THEIR WIVES, AS WELL AS MEN OF MEANER CONDITION

　　Lydia, a Lady of great beauty, birth, and honor, being Wife toNicostratus, Governour of Argos, falling in love with a Gentleman,named Pyrrhus; was requested by him (as a true testimony of herunfeigned affection) to performe three severall actions of herselfe. She did accomplish them all, and imbraced and kissed Pyrrhus inthe presence of Nicostratus; by perswading him, that whatsoever hesaw, was meerely false.

　　The Novell delivered, by Madame Neiphila, seemed so pleasing toall the Ladies; as they could not refraine from hearty laughter,beside much liberality of speech. Albeit the King did oftentimesurge silence, and commanded Pamphilus to follow next. So, whenattention was admitted, Pamphilus began in this order. I am ofopinion, faire Ladies, that there is not any matter, how uneasie ordoubtfull soever it may seeme to be; but the man or woman thataffecteth fervently, dare boldly attempt, and effectuallyaccomplish. And this perswasion of mine, although it hath beenesufficiently approved, by many of our passed Novels: Yetnotwithstanding, I shall make it much apparent to you, by a presentdiscourse of mine owne. Wherein I have occasion to speake of a Lady,to whom Fortune was more favourable, then either reason orjudgement, could give direction. In which regard, I would not adviseany of you, to entertaine so high an imagination of minde, as totracke her footsteps of whom I am now to speake: because Fortunecontaineth not alwayes one and the same disposition, neither can allmens eyes be blinded after one manner. And so proceed we to our Tale.

　　In Argos, a most ancient Citie of Achaya, much more renowned byher precedent Kings, then wealth, or any other great matter ofworth: there lived as Lieutenant or Governour thereof, a Noble Lord,named Nicostratus, on whom (albeit hee was well stept into yeares)Fortune bestowed in marriage a great Lady, no lesse bold of spirit,then choisely beautifull. Nicostratus, abounding in treasure andwealthy possessions, kept a goodly traine of Servants, Horses,Houndes, Hawkes, and what else not, as having an extraordinaryfelicity in all kinds of game, as singular exercises to maintainehis health.

　　Among his other Servants and Followers, there was a yongGentleman, gracefull of person, excellent in speech, and every wayas active as no man could be more: his name Pyrrhus, highly affectedof Nicostratus, and more intimately trusted then all the rest. Suchseemed the perfections of this Pyrrhus, that Lydia (for so was theLady named) began to affect him very earnestly, and in such sort, asday or night shee could take no rest, but devised all meanes tocompasse her harts desire. Now, whether he observed this inclinationof her towards him, or else would take no notice thereof, it could notbe discerned by any outward apprehension: which moved the moreimpatiency in her, and drove her hopes to dispairing passions. Whereinto finde some comfort and ease, she called an ancient Gentlewoman ofher Chamber, in whom shee reposed especiall confidence, and thus shespake to her.

　　Lesca, The good turnes and favours thou hast received from me,should make thee faithfull and obedient to me: and therefore set alocke uppon thy lippes, for revealing to any one whatsoever, suchmatters as now I shall impart to thee; except it be to him that Icommand thee. Thou perceivest Lesca, how youthfull I am, apt to allsprightly recreations, rich, and abounding in all that a woman canwish to have, in regard of Fortunes common and ordinary favours: yet Ihave one especiall cause of complaint: namely, the inequality of myMariage, my Husband being over-ancient for me; in which regard, myyouth finds it selfe too highly wronged, being defeated of thoseduties and delights, which Women (farre inferiour to me) arecontinuallie cloyed withall, and I am utterly deprived of. I amsubject to the same desires they are, and deserve to taste the benefitof them, in as ample manner, as they do or can.

　　Hitherto I have lived with the losse of time, which yet (in somemeasure) may be releeved and recompenced: For, though Fortune weremine enemy in Mariage, by such a disproportion of our conditions:yet she may befriend in another nature, and kindely redeeme the injurydone me. Wherefore Lesca, to be as compleate in this case, as I amin all the rest beside; I have resolved upon a private Friend, and onemore worthy then any other, Namely, my Servant Pyrrhus, whose youthcarieth some correspondency with mine; and so constantly have I setledmy love to him, as I am not well, but when I thinke on him, or seehim: and (indeede) shall dye, except the sooner I may enjoy him. Andtherefore, if my life and well-fare be respected by thee, let himunderstand the integrity of mine affection, by such good means as thoufindest it most expedient to be done: entreating him from me, that Imay have some conference with him, when he shall thereto besolicited by me.

　　The Chamber-Gentlewoman Lesca, willingly undertooke the LadiesEmbassie; and so soone as opportunity did favor her: having withdrawnePyrrhus into an apt and commodious place, shee delivered the Messageto him, in the best manner she could devise. Which Pyrrhus hearing,did not a little wonder thereat, never having noted any such matter;and therefore sodainly conceyved, that the Lady did this onely totry him; whereupon, somewhat roundly and roughly, hee returned thisanswere. Lesca, I am not so simple, as to credite any such Messageto be sent from my Lady, and therefore be better advised of thy words.But admit that it should come from her, yet I cannot be perswaded,that her soule consented to such harsh Language, far differing froma forme so full of beuty. And yet admit againe, that her hart andtongue herein were relatives: My Lord and Master hath so farrehonoured mee, and so much beyond the least part of merite in mee: as Iwill rather dye, then any way offer to disgrace him: And therefore Icharge thee, never more to move mee in this matter.

　　Lesca, not a jot danted at his stearne words, presently she saide.Pyrrhus, Both in this and all other Messages my Lady shall command me,I wil speake to thee whensoever shee pleaseth, receive what discontentthou canst thereby; or make presumption of what doubts thou maistdevise. But as I found thee a senselesse fellow, dull, and notshaped to any understanding, so I leave thee: And in that anger partedfrom him, carrying backe the same answer to her Lady. She no soonerheard it, but instantly shee wished her selfe to be dead; and withinsome few dayes after, she conferred againe with her Chamber-woman,saying. Lesca, thou knowest well enough, that the Oxe falleth not atthe first blow of the Axel neither is the victory won, upon a sillyand shallow adventure: Wherefore, I thinke it convenient, that oncemore thou shouldst make another tryall of him, who (in prejudice tome) standeth so strictly on his loyalty, and choosing such an houre asseemeth most commodious, soundly possesse him with my tormentingpassions. Bestirre thy Wittes, and tippe thy tongue with a Womanseloquence, to effect what I so earnestly desire: because, bylanguishing in this lovesicke affliction, it will bee the danger of mydeath, and some severe detriment to him, to be the occasion of sogreat a losse.

　　Lesca, comforted her Lady, so much as lay in her power to doe, andhaving sought for Pyrrhus, whom she found at good leysure; and, in apleasing humor, thus she beganne. Pyrrhus, some few dayes since Itolde thee, in what extreame Agonies thy Lady and mine was, onely inregarde of her love to thee: and now againe I come once more, togive thee further assurance thereof: Wherefore, beleeve itunfeignedly, that if thy obstinacie continue still, in like manneras the other day it did, expect very shortly to heare the tydings ofher death.

　　It is my part therefore, to entreat thee, to comfort her longlanguishing desires: but if thou persist in thy harsh opinion, instead of reputing thee a wise and fortunate yong man, I shall confessethee to bee an ignoraunt Asse. What a glorie is it to thee, to beaffected of so faire and worthy a Lady, beyond all men elsewhatsoever? Next to this, tell me, how highly maist thou confessethy self beholding to Fortune, if thou but duly consider, how sheehath elected thee as sole soveraigne of her hopes, which is a crowneof honour to thy youth and a sufficient refuge against all wants andnecessities? Where is any to thy knowledge like thy selfe, that canmake such advantage of his time, as thou maist do, if thou wertwise? Where canst thou find any one to go beyond thee in Armes,Horses, sumptuous garments, and Gold, as will be heaped on thee, ifLydia may be the Lady of thy love? Open then thine understanding to mywords, returne into thine owne souie, and bee wise for thy selfe.

　　Remember (Pyrrhus) that Fortune presents her selfe but once beforeany one, with cheerefull lookes, and her lappe wide open of richestfavours, where if choice be not quickely made, before she folde it up,not quic and turn her backe; let no complaint afterward be made ofher, if the Fellow that had so faire an offer, proove to be miserable,wretched, and a Begger, only thorow his owne negligence. Beside,what else hath formerly bin saide, there is now no such neede ofloyaltie in servants to their Ladies, as should be among deare Friendsand Kindred: but servants ought rather (as best they may) be such totheir Masters, as they are to them. Doest thou imagine, that if thouhadst a faire Wife, Mother, Daughter, or Sister, pleasing in the eyeof our Nicostratus; he would stand on such nice tearmes of duty orLoyaltie, as now thou doest to his Ladie? Thou wert a verie foole torest so perswaded. Assure thy selfe, that if entreaties and fairemeans might not prevalle, force, and compulsion (whatsoever ensuedthereon) woulde winne the masterie. Let us then use them, and thecommodities unto them belonging, as they would us and ours. Use thebenefit of thy Fortune, and beware of abusing her favour. She yetsmiles on thee; but take heede least she turne her backe, it will thenbe over-late to repent thy folly. And if my Ladie die through thydisdaine, be assured, that thou canst not escape with life, besideopen shame and disgrace for ever.

　　Pyrrhus, who had often considered on Lescaes first message,concluded with himselfe; that if any more she moved the same matter:hee would returne her another kinde of answere, wholly yeelding tocontent his Lady; provided, that he might remaine assured,concerning the intyre truth of the motion, and that it was not urgedonely to trie him, wherefore, thus he replyed. Lesca, do not imaginemee so ignorant, as not to know the certaintie of all thy formerallegations, confessing them as freely as thou doest, or canst. Butyet let mee tell thee withall, that I knowe my Lord to be wise andjudicious, and having committed all his affaires to my care and trust:never blame mee to misdoubt, least my Ladie (by his counsell andadvice) make thee the messenger of this motion, therby to call myFidelitie in question.

　　To cleare which doubt, and for my further assurance of her wellmeanning toward me; if she wil undertake the performance of three suchthings as I must needes require in this case: I am afterward her owne,in any service she can command me. The first of them, is; that inthe presence of my Lord and Master, she kill his faire Faulcon,which so dearly hee affecteth. The second, to send me a locke ortuft of his beard, being puld away with her owne hand. The third andlast, with the same hand also, to pluck out one of his best andsoundest teeth, and send it mee as her loves true token. When Ifinde all these three effectually performed, I am wholly hers, and notbefore.

　　These three strict impositions, seemed to Lesca, and her Ladielikewise, almost beyond the compasse of all possibility. NeverthelesLove, being a powerfull Oratour in perswading, as also adventurouseven on the most difficult dangers; gave her courage to undertake themall: sending Lesca backe againe to him, with full assurance, ofthese more then Herculean labours. Moreover, her selfe did intend toadde a fourth taske, in regard of his strong opinion concerning thegreat Wisedome of his Lord and Maister. After she had effected all theother three, she would not permit him to kisse her, but before hisLords face: which yet should be accomplished in such sort, asNicostratus himselfe should not beleeve it, although apparantly he sawit. Well, (quoth Pyrrhus) when all these wonders are performed, assuremy Ladie. that I am truelie hers.

　　Within a short while after, Nicostratus made a solemne Feastival(accorling as yearely he used to doe) in honour of his birth day,inviting many Lords and Ladies thereto. On which rejoycing day, sosoone as dinner was ended, and the Tables withdrawne: Lydia cameinto the great Hall, where the Feast was solemnly kept; very richand costly apparrelled; and there, in presence of Pyrrhus, and thewhole assemblie, going to the Perch whereon the Faulcone sate, whereinher Husband tooke no little delight, and having untyed her, as if sheemeant to beare her on her Fist: tooke her by the jesses, and beatingher against the wal, killed her. Nicostratus beholding this, calledout aloud unto her, saying. Alas Madame! What have you done? Shemaking him no answere, but turning to the Lords and Ladies, whichhad dined there, spake in this manner.

　　Ill should I take revenge on a King, that had offended me, if Ihad not so much heart, as to wreake my spleene on a paltry Hawke.Understand then, worthy Lords and Ladies, that this Faulcone hath longtime robbed me of those delights, which men (in meere equitie) oughtto have with their wives: because continually, so as breake of dayhath appeared, my Husband, starting out of bed, makes him selfereadie, presently to Horsse, and with this Faulcon on his Fist,rides abroad to his recreation in the Fields. And I, in suchforsaken sort as you see, am left all alone in my bed, discontentedand despised: often vowing to my selfe, to bee thus revenged as nowI am, being with-held from it by no other occasion, but onely wantof a fit and apt time, to do it in the presence of such persons, asmight bee just judges of my wrongs, and as I conceive you all to be.

　　The Lords and Ladies hearing these words, and beleeving this deed ofhers to be done no otherwise, but out of her entire affection toNicostratus, according as her speeches sounded: compassionatelyturning towards him (who was exceedingly displeased) and allsmiling, said. Now in good sadnesse Sir; Madame Lydia hath done wellin acting her just revenge upon the Hawke, that bereft her of herHusbands kinde companie; then which nothing is more precious to aloving wife, and a hell it is to live without it. And Lydia, beingsodainly with. into her chamber; with much other friendly and familiartalke, they converted the anger of Nicostratus into mirth and smiling.

　　Pyrrhus, who had diligently observed the whole cariage of thisbusinesse, saide to himselfe. My Ladie hath begun well, and proceedingon with no worse successe, will (no doubt) bring her love to anhappy conclusion. As for the Lady her selfe, she having thus kildthe Hawke, it was no long while after, but being in the Chamber withher husband, and they conversing familiarly together; she began tojest with him, and hee in the like manner with her, tickling andtoying each the other, till at the length she played with his beard,and now she found occasion aptly serving, to effect the second taskeimposed by Pyrrhus. So, taking fast hold on a small tuft of his beard,she gave a sodaine snatch, and plucked it away quite from his chin.Whereat Nicostratus beeing angerly moved, she (to appease hisdistaste) pleasantly thus spake. How now my Lord? Why do you lookeso frowningly? What? Are you angry for a few loose haires of yourbeard? How then should I take it, when you plucke mee by the haireof my head, and yet I am not a jot discontented, because I know you doit but in jesting manner? These friendly speeches cut off allfurther contention, and she kepte charily the tuft of er Husbandsbeard, which (the verie selfe-same day) shee sent to Pyrrhus herhearts chosen friend.

　　But now concerning the third matter to be adventured, it drove herto a much more serious consideration, then those two which shee hadalready so well and exactly performed. Notwithstanding, like a Ladieof unconquerable spirit, and (in whom) Love enlarged his power moreand more: she sodainly conceited, what course was best to bee keptin this case, forming her attempt in this manner. Upon Nicostratuswayted two young Gentlemen, as Pages of his Chamber, whose Fathers hadgiven them to his service, to learne the manners of honourableCourtship, and those qualities necessarily required in Gentlemen.One of them, when Nicostratus sate downe to dinner or supper, stood inOffice of his Carver, delivering him all the meats whereon he fed. Theother (as Taster) attended on his Cup, and he dranke no otherdrinke, but what hee brought him, and they both were highly pleasingunto him.

　　On a day, Lydia called these two youths aside; and, among some otherspeeches, which served but as an induction to her intended policy; sheperswaded them, that their mouths yeelded an unsavoury andilpleasing smell, whereof their Lord seemed to take dislike. Whereforeshe advised them, that at such times as they attended on him intheir severall places: they should (so much as possibly they could)withdraw their heads aside from him, because their breath might not benoyous unto him. But withall, to have an especiall care, of notdisclosing to any one, what she had told them; because (out of meerelove) she had acquainted them therewith: which very coistantly theybeleeved, and followed the same direction as she had advised, beingloath to displease, where service bound them to obey. Choosing atime fitting for her purpose, when Nicostratus was in privateconference with her, thus she began. Sir, you observe not thebehaviour of your two Pages, when they wait on you at the Table? Yesbut I do wife (quoth he) how squemishly they turn their heads asidefrom me, and it hath often bin in my minde, to understand a reason whythey do so.

　　Seating her selfe by him, as if shee had some weighty matter to tellhim; she proceeded in this manner. Alas my Lord, you shall not need toquestion them, because I can sufficiently resolve you therein: which(neverthelesse) I have long concealed, because I would not beoffensive to you. But in regard, it is now manifestly apparant, thatothers have tasted, what (I immagined) none but my selfe did, I willno longer hide it from you. Assuredly Sir, there is a most strange andunwonted ill-savour, continually issuing from your mouth, smellingmost noysomely, and I wonder what should be the occasion. In formertimes, I never felt any such foule breathing to come from you: andyou, who do dally converse with so many worthy persons, should seekemeanes to be rid of so great an annoyance. You say verie true wife(answered Nicostratus) and I protest to you on my Credite, I feeleno such ill smell, neither know what should cause it, except I havesom corrupted tooth in my mouth. Perhaps Sir (quoth she) it may be so,and yet you feele not the savour which others do, yea, veryoffensively.

　　So, walking with her to a Window, he opened wide his mouth, thewhich nicely shee surveyed on either side, and, turning her headfrom him, as seeming unable to endure the savour: starting, andshrieking out alowd, she said. Santa Maria! What a sight is this? Alasmy good Lord, How could you abide this, and for so long a while? Heereis a tooth on this side, which (so farre as I can perceive) is notonely hollow and corrupted: but also wholly putrified and rotten,and if it continue still in your head, beleeve it for a truth, that itwill infect and spoile all the rest neere it. I would thereforecounsell you, to let it be pluckt out, before it breede your furtherdanger. I like your counsell well Lydia, replyed Nicostratus, andpresently intend to follow it; Let therefore my Barber be sent for,and, without any longer delay, he shall plucke it forth instantly.

　　How sir? (quoth she,) your Barber? Uppon mine Honour, there shallcome no Barber heere. Why Sir, it is such a rotten Tooth, and standethso fairely for my hand: that, without helpe or advice of any Barber,let mee alone for plucking it forth without putting you to any paineat all. Moreover, let me tell you Sir, those Tooth-drawers are so rudeand cruell, in performing such Offices, as my heart cannot endure,that you should come within compasse of their currish courtesie,neither shall you Sir, if you will be ruled by me. If I should failein the manner of their facilitie, yet love and duty hath enstructedme, to forbeare your least paining, which no unmannerly Barber willdo.

　　Having thus spoken, and he well contented with her kinde offer,the instruments were brought, which are used in such occasions, allbeing commanded forth of the Chamber, but onely Lesca, who evermorekept still in her company. So, locking fast the doore, and Nicostratusbeing seated, as she thought fittest for her purpose, she put theTanacles into his mouth, catching fast hold on one of his soundestteeth: which, notwithstanding his loud crying, Lesca held him sostrongly, that forth she pluckt it, and hid it, having another toothreadie made hot, and bloody, very much corrupted and rotten, which shehelde in the Tanacles, and shewed to him, who was well-neere halfedead with anguish. See Sir (quoth she) was this Tooth to be sufferedin your head, and to yeeld so foule a smell as it did? He verilybeleeving what she said, albeit hee had endured extreame paine, andstill complained on her harsh and violent pulling it out: rejoycedyet, that he was now ridde of it, and she comforting him on the oneside, and the anguish asswaging him on the other, he departed forth ofthe Chamber.

　　In the mean while, by Lesca she sent the sound tooth to Pyrrhus, who(wondering not a little at her so many strange attempts, which heeurged so much the rather, as thinking their performance impossible,and in meere loyall duty to his Lord) seeing them all three to benotably effected; he made no further doubt of her intire love towardeshim, but sent her assurance likewise, of his readinesse andserviceable diligence, whensoever she would command him.

　　Now, after the passage of all these adventures, hardly to beeundertaken by any other Woman: yet she held them insufficient forhis security, in the grounded perswasion of her love to him, exceptshee performed another of her owne, and according as shee had boldlypromised. Houres do now seeme dayes, and dayes multiplicitie ofyeeres, till the kisse may be given, and receyved in the presence ofNicostratus, yet hee himselfe to avouch the contrary.

　　Madam Lydia (upon a pretended sicknesse) keepeth her chamber, and aswomen can hardly be exceeded in dissimulation: so, shee wanted no wit,to seeme exquisitely cunning, in all the outwarde apparances ofsicknesse. One day after dinner, shee being visited by Nicostratus,and none attending on him but Pyrrhus onely: she earnestlyentreated, that as a mitigation, to some inward afflictions whichshe felt, they would helpe to guide her into the Garden.

　　Most gladly was her motion graunted, and Nicostratus gently takingher by one arme, and Pyrrhus by the other, so they conducted herinto the Garden, seating her in a faire floury Grasse-plot, with herbacke leaning to a Peare-tree. Having sitten there an indifferentwhile, and Pyrrhus, being formerly enstructed, in the directions whichshe had given him, thus shee spake, some-what faintly. Pyrrhus, I havea kinde of longing desire upon a sodaine, to taste of these Peares:Wherefore, climbe up into the Tree, and cast me downe one or two;which instantly hee did. Being aloft in the Tree, and throwing downesome of the best and ripest Peares; at length (according to hispremeditated Lesson) looking downe, he said.

　　Forbeare my Lord, Do you not see, in how weake and feeblecondition my Ladie is, being shaken with so violent a sicknesse? Andyou Madam, how kinde and loving soever you are to my Lord, Are youso little carefull of your health, being but now come forth of yoursicke Chamber, to be ruffled and tumbled in such rough manner?Though such dalliances are not amisse in you both; being fitter forthe private Chamber, then an open garden, and in the presence of aservant: yet time and place should alwaies bee respectivelyconsidered, for the avoiding of ill example, and better testimonieof your owne Wisedomes, which ever should be like your selves. Butif so soone, and even in the heate of a yet turbulent sicknesse,your equall love can admit these kisses and embraces: your privateLodginges were much more convenient, where no Servants eye can seesuch Wantonnesse, nor you be reproved of indiscretion, for being toopublique in your Familiaritie. Madame Lydia, sodainely starting, andturning unto her Husband, sayde. What doth Pyrrhus prate? Is he wellin his wittes? Or is he franticke? No Madame, replyed Pyrrhus, I amnot franticke. Are you so fond as to thinke that I do not see yourfolly? Nicostratus wondering at his Words, presently answered. Nowtrust me Pyrrhus, I think thou dreamest. No my Lord, replyedPyrrhus, I dreame not a jot, neither do you, or my Ladie: but ifthis Tree could affoord the like kindnesse to me, as you do to her,there would not a Peare bee left uppon it. How now Pyrrhus? (quothLydia) this language goeth beyond our understanding, it seemeth thouknowest not what thou saist. Beleeve me husband, if I were as wellas ever I have bin, I would climb this tree, to see those idle wonderswhich hee talketh of: for, while he continueth thus above, itappeareth, hee can finde no other prattle, albeit he taketh hismarke amisse.

　　Heereupon, he commanded Pyrrhus to come downe, and being on theground: Now Pyrrhus (quoth he) tell me what thou saydst. Pyrrhus,pretending an alteration into much amazement, straungely looking abouthim, saide; I know not verie well (my Lord) what answere I should makeyou, fearing least my sight hath bin abused by error: for when I wasaloft in that Tree, it seemed manifestly to me: that you embraced myLady (though somewhat rudely, in regard of her perillous sicknesse,yet lovingly) and as youthfully as in your yonger dales, with infinitekisses, and wanton dalliances, such as (indeede) deserved a far moreprivate place in my poore opinion. But in my descending downe, meethought you gave over that amorous familiaritie, and I found youseated as I left you. Now trust mee Pyrrhus, answered Nicostratus, Thytongue and wit have very strangely wandred, both from reason and allreall apprehension: because we never stirred from hence, since thoudidst climbe up into the Tree, neither mooved otherwise, then as nowthou seest us. Alas my Lord (saide Pyrrhus) I humbly crave pardonfor my presumption, in reprooving you for medling with your owne:which shal make me hereafter better advised, in any thing whatsoever I heare or see.

　　Mervaile and amazement, encreased in Nicostratus far greater thenbefore, hearing him to avouch still so constantly what he had seene,no contradiction being able to alter him, which made him rashly sweareand say. I will see my selfe, whether this Peare-tree bee enchanted,or no: and such wonders to be seene when a man is up in it, as thouwouldst have us to beleeve. And being mounted up so hy, that they weresafe from his sodaine comming on them, Lydia had soone forgotten hersicknes, and the promised kisse cost her above twenty more, besideverie kinde and hearty embraces, as lovingly respected and entertainedby Pyrrhus. Which Nicostratus beholding aloft in the tree; cryed outto her, saying. Wicked woman, What doest thou meane? And thouvillain Pyrrhus, Darst thou abuse thy Lord, who hath reposed so muchtrust in thee? So, descending in haste downe againe, yet crying soto them still: Lydia replyed, Alas my Lord, Why do you raile andrave in such sort? So, he( found her seated as before, and Pyrrhuswaiting with dutiful reverence, even as when he climbed up the Tree:but yet he thought his sight not deceyved, for all their demure andformall behaviour, which made him walke up and downe, extreamelyfuming and fretting unto himselfe, and which in some milder mannerto qualifie, Pyrrhus spake thus to him.

　　I deny not (my good Lord) but freely confesse, that even as yourselfe, so I, being above in the Tree, had my sight most falselydeluded: which is so apparantly confirmed by you, and in the samesort, as there needeth no doubt of both our beguiling; in one andthe same suspitious nature. In which case to be the more assuredlyresolved, nothing can be questioned, but whether your beleefe do sofarre misleade you, as to thinke, that my Ladie (who hath alwayes benemost wise, loyall, and vertuous,) would so shamefullie wrong you: yea,and to performe it before your face, wherein I dare gadge my life tothe contrary. Concerning my selfe, it is not fit for mee, to argueor contest in mine owne commendation: you that have ever knowne thesincerity of my service, are best able to speake in my behalfe: andrather wold I be drawne in peeces with foure wilde horses, then beesuch an injurious slave to my Lord and Master.

　　Now then, it can be no otherwise, but we must needs restcertainely perswaded, that the guile and offence of this falseappearance, was occasioned by thee onely. For all the world couldnot make me otherwise beleeve, but that I saw you kisse and mostkindely imbrace my Lady: if your owne eyes had not credited the likebehaviour in me to her, of which sinne, I never conceived so much as athought. The Lady (on the other side) seeming to be very angerlyincensed, starting faintly up on her feet, yet supporting her selfe bythe tree, said. It appeareth Sir, that you have entertained a goodlyopinion of me, as, if I were so lewde and lasciviously disposed, oraddicted to the very least desire of wantonnesse: that I would beeso forgetfull of mine owne honour, as to adventure it in your sight,and with a servant of my house? Oh Sir, such women as are sofamiliarly affected, need learne no wit of men in amourous matters;their private Chambers shall be better trusted, then an open blabingand tell-tale Garden.

　　Nicostratus, who verily beleeved what they had both said, and thatneither of them would adventure such familiarity before his face:would talke no more of the matter, but rather studyed of the rarity ofsuch a miracle, not seene, but in the height of the tree, and changingagaine up on the descent. But Lydia, containing still hercollourable kinde of impatience, and angerly frowning uponNicostratus, stearnely saide. If I may have my will, this villanousand deceiving tree, shall never more shame me, or any other woman: andtherefore Pyrrhus, runne for an Axe, and by felling it to theground, in an instant, revenge both thy wrong and mine. Doest not thouserve a worthy Lord? And have not I a wise Husband, who, without anyconsideration, will suffer the eye of his understanding to be sodazeled, with a foolish imagination beyond all possibility? For,although his eyes did apprehend such a folly, and it seemed to be atruth indeed: yet, in the depth of setled judgement, all the worldshould not perswade him, that it was so.

　　Pyrrhus had quickely brought the Axe, and hewing downe the tree,so soone as the Lady saw it fall; turning her selfe to Nicostratus,she said. Now that I have seene mine honour and honesties enemy laidalong; mine anger is past, and Husband, I freely pardon you:intreating you heartily henceforward, not to presume or imagine,that my love eyther is, or can bee altred from you.

　　Thus the mocked and derided Nicostratus, returned in againe with hisLady and Pyrrhus; where perhaps (although the Peare-tree was cutdowne) they could find as cunning meanes to over-reach him.

　　THE SEVENTH DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN SUCH MEN ARE COVERTLY REPREHENDED, WHO MAKE NO CARE OR

　　CONSCIENCE AT ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT SHOULD PRESERVE

　　THEM FROM SINNE

　　Two Citizens of Siena, the one named Tingoccio Mini, and the otherMeucio di Tura, affected both one woman, called Monna Mita, to whomthe one of them was a Gossip. The Gossip dyed, and appearedafterward to his companion, according as he had formerly promisedhim to doe, and tolde him what strange wonders he had seene in theother world.

　　Now there remained none but the King himselfe, last of all torecount his Novell; who, after hee heard the Ladies complaintsindifferently pacified, for the rash felling downe of such aprecious Peare-tree; thus he began. Faire Ladies, it is a case morethen manifest, that every King, who will be accounted just andupright: should first of all, and rather then any other, observe thoseLawes which he himselfe hath made; otherwise he ought to be reputed asa servant, worthy of punishment, and no King. Into which fault andreprehension, I your King, shall well neere be constrained to fall;for yesterday I enacted a Law, upon the forme of our discoursing, withfull intent, that this day I would not use any part of mypriviledge; but being subject (as you all are) to the same Law, Ishould speake of that argument, which already you have done.

　　Wherein, you have not onely performed more then I could wish, upon asubject so sutable to my minde: but in every Novell, such variety ofexcellent matter, such singular illustrations, and delicateeloquence hath flowne from you all; as I am utterly unable to inventany thing (notwithstanding the most curious search of my braine) aptor fit for the purpose, to paragon the meanest of them alreadyrelated. And therefore seeing I must needs sinne in the Lawestablished by my selfe; I tender my submission, as worthy ofpunishment, or what amends else you please to enjoyne mee. Now, asreturned to my wonted priviledge, I say, that the Novell recountedby Madame Eliza, of the Fryar Godfather and his Gossip Agnesia, asalso the sottishnesse of the Senese her Husband, hath wrought in me(worthy Ladies) to such effect; as, forbearing to speake any more ofthese wily prancks, which witty wives exercise on their simpleHusbands; I am to tell you a pretty short Tale; which, though there ismatter enough in it, not worthy the crediting, yet partly it willbee pleasing to heare.

　　Sometime there lived in Sienna two popular men; the one beingnamed Tingoccio Mini, and the other Meucio de Tura; Men simple, and ofno understanding, both of them dwelling in Porta Salaia. These two menlived in such familiar conversation together, and expressed suchcordiall affection each to other, as they seldome walked asunder;but (as honest men use to doe) frequented Churches and Sermons,oftentimes hearing, both what miseries and beatitudes were in theworld to come, according to the merits of their soules that weredeparted out of this life, and found their equall repaiment in theother. The manifold repetition of these matters, made them veryearnestly desirous to know, by what meanes they might have tydingsfrom thence, for their further confirmation. And finding all theirendeavours utterly frustrated, they made a solemne vow and promise(each to other under oath) that hee which first dyed of them two,should returne backe againe (so soone as possibly he could) to theother remaining alive, and tell him such tydings as hee desired toheare.

　　After the promise was thus faithfully made, and they still keepingcompany, as they were wont to doe: It fortuned, that Tingocciobecame Gossip to one, named Ambrosio Anselmino, dwelling inCamporegglo, who by his wife, called Monna Mita, had a sweet andlovely Sonne. Tingoccio often resorting thither, and consorted withhis companion Meucio; the she-Gossip, being a woman worthy the loving,faire and comely of her person. Tingoccio, notwithstanding theGossipship betweene them, had more then a moneths minde to hisGodchilds Mother. Meucio also fell sicke of the same disease,because shee seemed Fleasing in his eye, and Tingoccio gave he nomeane commendations; yet, carefully hey concealed their love tothemselves, but not for one and the same occasion. Because Tingocciokept it closely from Meucio, lest he should hold it disgracefull inhim, to beare amourous affection to his Gossip, and thought itunfitting to bee knowne. But Meucio had no such meaning, for heeknew well enough that Tingoccio loved her, and therefore conceivedin his minde, that if he discovered any such matter to him: He will(quoth he) be jealous of me, and being her Gossip (which admitteth hisconference with her when himselfe pleaseth;) he may easily make her todistaste me, and therefore I must rest contented as I am.

　　Their love continuing on still in this kinde, Tingoccio prooved sofortunate in the businesse, that having better meanes then hiscompanion, and more prevayring courses, when, where, and how toCourt his Mistresse, which seemed to forward him effectually. Allwhich Meucio plainely perceived, and though it was tedious andwearisome to him, yet hoping to finde some successe at length: hewould not take notice of any thing, as fearing to infringe the amitybetweene him and Tingoccio, and so his hope to be quite supplanted.Thus the one triumphing in his loves happinesse, and the otherhoping for his felicity to come; a lingering sickenesse seazed onTingoccio, which brought him to so low a condition, as at the lengthhe dyed.

　　About some three or foure nights after, Meucio being fast asleepe inhis bed, the ghoste of Tingoccio appeared to him, and called soloude that Meucio awaking, demanded who called him? I am thy friendTingoccio, replied the ghoste, who according to my former promisemade, am come again in vision to thee, to tell thee tidings out of thenether world. Meucio was a while somewhat amazed: but, recollectinghis more manly spirits together, boldly he said. My brother andfriend, thou art heartily welcome: but I thought thou hadst beeneutterly lost. Those things (quoth Tingoccio) are lost, which cannot berecovered againe, and if I were lost, how could I then be heere withthee? Alas Tingoccio, replyed Meucio, my meaning is not so: but Iwould be resolved, whether thou art among the damned soules, in thepainefull fire of hell torments, or no? No (quoth Tingoccio) I amnot sent thither, but for divers sinnes by mee committed I am tosuffer very great and grievous paines. Then Meucio demaundedparticularly, the punishments inflicted there, for the severall sinnescommitted heere: Wherein Tingoccio fully resolved him. And uponfurther question, what hee would have to be done for him here, madeanswere, That Meucio should cause Masses, Prayers and Almes-deeds tobe performed for him, which (he said) were very helpefull to thesoules abiding there, and Meucio promised to see them done.

　　As the ghost was offering to depart, Meucio remembred TingoccioesGossip Monna Mita, and raysing himselfe higher upon his pillowe, said.My memorie informeth me friend Tingoccio, your kinde Gossip MonnaMita, with whom (when you remained in this life) I knew you to be veryfamiliar: let me intreat you then to tell me, what punishment isinflicted on you there, for that wanton sinne committed heere? OhBrother Meucio, answered Tingoccio, so soone as my soule was landedthere, one came immediately to me, who seemed to know all mineoffences readily by heart, and forthwith commanded, that I shoulddepart thence into a certaine place, where I must weepe for mysinnes in very grievous paines. There I found more of my companions,condemned to the same punishment as I was, and being among them, Icalled to minde some wanton dalliances, which had passed betweene myGossip and me, and expecting therefore farre greater afflictions, thenas yet I felt (although I was in a huge fire, and exceedingly hot) yetwith conceite of feare, I quaked and trembled wondrously.

　　One of my other Consorts being by me, and perceiving in what anextreame agony I was; presently said unto me. My friend, what hastthou done more, then any of us here condemned with thee, that thoutremblest and quakest, being in so hot a fire? Oh my friend (quothI) I am in feare of a greater judgement then this, for a grievousoffence by mee heretofore committed while I lived. Then heedemaunded of mee what offence it was, whereto thus I answered. Itwas my chance in the other world, to be Godfather at a childsChristning, and afterward I grew so affectionate to the childs mother,as (indeed) I kissed her twice or thrise. My companyon laughing atme in mocking manner, replyed thus. Goe like an Asse as thou art,and be no more afraid hereafter, for here is no punishmentinflicted, in any kinde whatsoever, for such offences of frailtycommitted, especially with Gossips, as I my selfe can witnesse.

　　Now day drew on, and the Cockes began to crow, a dreadfull hearingto walking spirits, when Tingoccio said to Meucio. Farewell myfriendly companion, for I may tarry no longer with thee, and instantlyhee vanished away. Meucio having heard this confession of hisfriend, and verily beleeving it for a truth, that no punishment was tobe inflicted in the future world, for offences of frailty in thislife, and chiefly with Gossips: began to condemne his owne folly,having bin a Gossip to many wives, yet modesty restrained him fromsuch familiar offending. And therefore being sorry for this grosseignorance, hee made a vowe to be wiser hereafter. And if Fryar Reynardhad been acquainted with this kind of shrift (as doubtlesse he was,though his Gossip Agnesia knew it not) he needed no suchSyllogismes, as he put in practise, when he converted her to hislustfull knavery, in the comparison of kinred by him moved, concerningher husband, the childe and himselfe. But, these are the best fruitsof such Fryerly Confessions, to compasse the issue of their inordinateappetites; yet clouded with the cloake of Religion, which hath beenethe overthrow of too many.

　　By this time the gentle blast of Zephirus began to blow, because theSunne grew neere his setting, wherewith the King concluded his Novell,and none remaining more to be thus imployed: taking the Crowne fromoff his owne head, he placed it on Madame Laurettaes, saying,Madame, I Crowne you with your owne Crowne, as Queene of ourCompany. You shall henceforth command as Lady and Mistresse, in suchoccasions as shall be to your liking, and for the contentment of usall; With which words he set him downe. And Madame Lauretta beingnow created Queene, shee caused the Master of the houshold to beecalled, to whom she gave command, that the Tables should be prepared nthe pleasant vally, but at a more convenient houre, then formerlyhad beene, because they might (with better ease) returne backe tothe Pallace. Then shee tooke order likewise, for all such othernecessary matters, as should bee required in the time of f Regiment:and then turning her selfe to the whole Company, she began in thismanner.

　　It was the Will of Dioneus yesternight, that our discourses for thisday, should concerne the deceits of wives to their Husbands. Andwere it not to avoyde taxation, of a spleenitive desire to berevenged, like the dog being bitten, biteth againe: I could commandour to morrows conference, to touch mens treacheries towards theirwives. But because I am free from any such fiery humor, let it be yourgenerall consideration, to speake of such queint beguylings, as haveheretofore past, either of the woman to the man, the man to the woman,or of one man to another: and I am of opinion, that they will yeeld usno lesse delight, then those related (this day) have done. When shehad thus spoken, she rose; granting them all liberty, to goerecreate themselves untill Supper time.

　　The Ladies being thus at their owne disposing, some of them baredtheir legges and feete, to wash them in the coole current. Others, notso minded, walked on the greene grasse, and under the goodly spread:trees. Dioneus and Madame Fiammetta, they sate singing together, thelove-warre between Arcit and Palemon. And thus with diversity ofdisports, in choice delight and much contentment, all were imployed,till Supper drew neere. When the houre re come, and the Tables coveredby the Ponds side: we need not question their dyet and dainties,infinite Birds sweetly singing about them, as no musicke in theworld could be more pleasing; beside calme windes, fanning their facesfrom the neighbouring hilles (free from flyes, or the least annoyance)made a delicate addition to their pleasure.

　　No sooner were the Tables withdrawne, and all risen: but they fetchta few turnings about the vally, because the Sunne was not (as yet)quite set. Then in the coole evening, according to the Queenesappointment: in a soft and gentle pace, they walked homeward: devisingon a thousand occasions, as well those which the dayes discourseshad yeelded, as others of their owne inventing beside. It was almostdarke night, before they arrived at the Pallace; where, with varietyof choice Wines, and abounding plenty of rare Banquetting, they outwore the little toile and wearinesse, which the long walke had chargedthem withall. Afterward, according to their wonted order, theInstruments being brought and played on, they fell to dancing aboutthe faire Fountaine; Tindaro intruding (now and then) the sound of hisBagpipe, to make the musicke seeme more melodious. But in the end, theQueene commanded Madame Philomena to sing; whereupon the Instrumentsbeing tuned fit for the purpose, thus she began.

　　THE SONG

　　THE CHORUS SUNG BY THE WHOLE COMPANY

　　Wearisome is my life to me,

　　Because I cannot once againe returne;

　　Unto the place which made me first to mourne.

　　Nothing I know, yet feele a powerfull fire,

　　Burning within my brest,

　　Through deepe desire;

　　To be once more where first I felt unrest,

　　Which cannot be exprest.

　　O my sole good! O my best happinesse!

　　Why am I thus restrainde?

　　Is there no comfort in this wretchednesse?

　　Then let me live content, to be thus painde.

　　Wearisome is my life to me, etc,

　　I cannot tell what was that rare delight,

　　Which first enflamde my soule,

　　And gave command in spight,

　　That I should find no ease by day or night,

　　But still live in controule.

　　I see, I heare, and feele a kinde of blisse,

　　Yet find no forme at all:

　　Other in their desire, feele blessednesse,

　　But I have none, nor thinke I ever shall.

　　Wearisome is my life to me, etc.

　　Tell me, if I may hope in following dayes,

　　To have but one poore sight,

　　Of those bright Sunny rayes,

　　Dazeling my sence, did overecome me quite,

　　Bequeath'd to wandring wayes.

　　If I be poasted off, and may not prove,

　　To have the smallest grace:

　　Or but to know, that this proceeds from love,

　　Why should I live despisde in every place?

　　Wearisome is my life to me, etc.

　　Me thinkes milde favour whispers in mine eare,

　　And bids me not despaire;

　　There will a time appeare

　　To quell and quite confound consuming care,

　　And joy surmount proud feare.

　　In hope that gracious time will come at length,

　　To cheare my long dismay:

　　My spirits reassume your former strength,

　　And never dread to see that joyfull day.

　　Wearisome is my life to me,

　　Because I cannot once againe returne;

　　Unto the place, which made me first to mourne.

　　This Song gave occasion to the whole Company, to imagine, thatsome new and pleasing apprehension of Love, constrained MadamePhilomena to sing in this manner. And because (by the discoursethereof) it plainely appeared, that shee had felt more then sheesaw, shee was so much the more happy, and the like was wished by allthe rest. Wherefore, after the Song was ended; the Queeneremembring, that the next day following was Friday, turning herselfe graciously to them all, thus she spake.

　　You know noble Ladies, and you likewise most noble Gentlemen, thatto morrow is the day consecrated to the Passion of our blessed Lordand Saviour, which (if you have not forgotten it, as easily youcannot) we devoutly celebrated, Madame Neiphila being then Queene,ceasing from all our pleasant discoursing, as we did the like on theSaturday following, sanctifiing the sacred Sabboth, in due regard ofit selfe. Wherefore, being desirous to imitate precedent good example,which in worthy manner shee began to us all: I hold it very decent andnecessary, that we should abstaine to morrow, and the day ensuing,from recounting any of our pleasant Novels, reducing to ourmemories, what was done (as on those dayes) for the salvation of oursoules. This holy and Religious motion made by the Queene, wascommendably allowed by all the assembly, and therefore, humblytaking their leave of her, and an indifferent part of the nightbeing already spent; severally they betooke themselves to theirChambers.

　　THE INDUCTION TO THE EIGHT DAY

　　WHEREON ALL THE DISCOURSES, PASSE UNDER THE RULE AND

　　GOVERNMENT, OF THE HONOURABLE LADIE LAURETTA

　　Earely on the Sonday Morning, Aurora shewing her selfe bright andlovely; the Sunnes Golden beames beganne to appeare, on the toppesof the neere adjoyning Mountaines; so, that Hearbes, Plants, Trees,and all things else, were verie evidently to be discerned.

　　When midday, and the heate thereof was well over-past, so that theaire seemed mild and temperate: according as the Queene had commanded;they were all seated againe about the Fountaine, with intent toprosecute their former pastime. And then Madame Neiphila, by thecharge imposed on her, as first speaker for this day, beganne asfolloweth.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, THAT SUCH WOMEN AS WILL MAKE SALE OF THEIR

　　HONESTIE, ARE SOMETIMES OVER-REACHED IN THEIR PAYMENT,

　　AND JUSTLY SERVED AS THEY SHOULD BE

　　Gulfardo made a match or wager, with the Wife of Gasparuolo, for theobtaining of her amorous favour, in regard of a summe of money firstto be given her. The money hee borrowed of her Husband, and gave it inpayment to her, as in case of discharging him from her Husbandsdebt. After his returne home from Geneway, hee told him in thepresence of his wife, how he had payde the whole summe to her, withcharge of delivering it to her Husband, which she confessed to betrue, albeit greatly against her will.

　　Seeing is my fortune, Gracious ladies, that I must give beginning tothis dayes discoursing, by some such Novel which I thinke expedient;as duty bindeth me, I am therewith well contented. And because thedeceits of Women to men, have beene at large and liberally related;I will tell you a subtile tricke of a man to a Woman. Not that I blamehim for the deede, or thinke the deceyte not well fitted to the woman:but I speake it in a contrarie nature, as commending the man, andcondemning the woman very justly, as also to shew, how men can as wellbeguile those crafty companions, which least beleeve any suchcunning in them, as they that stand most on their artificiall skill.

　　Howbeit, to speake more properly, the matter by me to be reported,deserveth not the reproachfull title of deceite, but rather of arecompence duly returned: because women ought to be chaste and honest,and to preserve their honour as their lives, without yeelding to thecontamination thereof, for any occasion whatsoever. And yetneverthelesse (in regard of our frailty) many times we proove not soconstant as we should be: yet I am of opinion, that she whichselleth her honestie for money, deserveth justly to be burned. Whereason the contrary, she that falleth into the offence, onely throughintire affection (the powerfull lawes of Love beeing above allresistance) in equity meriteth pardon, especially of a Judge notover-rigorous: as not long since wee heard from Philostratus, inrevealing what hapned to Madam Phillippa de Prato, upon thedangerous Edict.

　　Understand then, my most worthy Auditors, that there livedsometime in Millaine an Almaigne Soldiour, named Gulfardo, ofcommendable carriage in his person, and very faithfull to such as heserved, a matter not common among the Almaignes. And because he madejust repayment, to every one which lent him monies; he grew to suchespeciall credit, and was so familiar with the very best Marchants; as(manie times) he could not be so ready to borrow, as they were willingalwaies to lend him. He thus continuing in the Cittie of Millaine,fastened his affection on a verie beautifull Gentlewoman, namedMistresse Ambrosia, Wife unto a rich Merchant, who was calledSignior Gasparuolo Sagastraccio, who had good knowledge of him, andrespectively used him. Loving this Gentlewoman with greatdiscretion, without the least apprehension of her husband: he sentupon a day to entreate conference with her, for enjoying thefruition of her love, and she should find him ready to fulfillwhatsoever she pleased to command him, as, at any time he would makegood his promise.

　　The Gentlewoman, after divers of these private solicitings,resolutely answered, that she was as ready to fulfill the request ofGulfardo, provided, that two especiall considerations might ensuethereon. First, the faithfull concealing thereof from any personliving. Next, because she knew him to be rich, and she had occasion touse two hundred Crowns, about businesse of important consequence: heshould freely bestow so many on her, and (ever after) she was to becommanded by him. Gulfardo perceiving the covetousnesse of this woman,who (notwithstanding his doting affection) he thought to be intirelyhonest to her Husband: became so deepely offended at her vile answere,that his fervent love converted into as earnest loathing her;determining constantlie to deceive her, and to make her avaritiousmotion, the only means wherby to effect it.

　　He sent her word, that he was willing to performe her request, orany farre greater matter for her: in which respect, he onely desiredfor to know, when she would be pleased to have him come see her, andto receive the money of him? No creature hee acquainted with hissetled purpose, but onely a deere friend and kinde companion, whoalwayes used to keepe him company, in the neerest occasions thatconcerned him. The Gentlewoman, or rather most disloyall wife, upponthis answer sent her, was extraordinarily jocond and contented,returning him a secret Letter, wherein she signified: thatGasparuolo her husband, had important affaires which called him toGeneway: but he should understand of his departure, and then (withsafety) he might come see her, as also his bringing of the Crownes.

　　In the meane while, Gulfardo having determined what he would do,watched a convenient time, when he went unto Gasparuolo, and sayde:Sir, I have some businesse of maine importance, and shall neede to usebut two hundred Crownes onely: I desire you to lend me so manyCrownes, upon such profite as you were wont to take of mee, at othertimes when I have made use of you, and I shall not faile you at myday.

　　Gasparuolo was well contented with the motion, and made no moreadoe, but counted downe the Crownes: departing thence (within a fewdayes after) for Geneway, according to his Wives former message; shegiving Gulfardo also intelligence of his absence, that now (withsafety) hee might come see her, and bring the two hundred Crownes withhim.

　　Gulfardo, taking his friend in his company, went to visitMistresse Ambrosia, whom he found in expectation of his arrivall,and the first thing he did, he counted downe the two hundredCrownes; and delivering them to her in the presence of his friend,saide: Mistresse Ambrosia, receive these two hundred Crownes, whichI desire you to pay unto your Husband on my behalfe, when he isreturned from Geneway. Ambrosia, receyved the two hundred Crownes, notregarding wherefore Gulfardo used these words: because shee verilybeleeved, that hee spake in such manner, because his friend shouldtake no notice, of his giving them to her, upon any covenant passedbetweene them; whereuppon, she sayde. Sir, I will pay them to myHusband for you; and cause him to give you a sufficient discharge: butfirst I will count them over my selfe, to see whether the summe bejust, or no. And having drawne them over upon the Table, the summecontaining truly two hundred Crownes (wherewith she was most highlycontented) she lockt them safe uppe in her Cuppeboord, andGulfardoes Friend being gone (as formerly it was compacted betweenethem) shee came to converse more familiarly with him, havingprovided a banquet for him. What passed between them afterward, boththen, and oftentimes beside, before her Husbande returned home, is amatter out of y element, and rather requires my ignoance thenknowledge.

　　When Gasparuolo was come from Genway, Gulfardo observing aconvenient time, when he was sitting at the doore with his Wife; tookehis Friend with him, and comming to Gasparuolo, said. Worthy Sir,the two hundred Crownes which you lent me before your journy toGeneway, in regard they could not serve my turne, to compasse thebusinesse for which I borrowed them: within a day or two after, in thepresence of this Gentle man my friend, I made repayment of them toyour Wife, and therefore I pray you crosse me out of your booke.

　　Gasparuolo turning to his Wife, demanded; Whether it was so, orno? She beholding the witnesse standing by, who was also present ather receyving them: durst not make deniall, but thus answered. IndeedeHusband, I received two hundred Crownes of the Gentleman, and neverremembred, to acquaint you therewith since your comming home: buthereafter I will be made no more your receiver, except I carried aquicker memory. Then saide Gasparuolo: Signior Gulfardo, I finde youalwaies a most honest Gentleman, and will be readie at any time, todoe you the like, or a farre greater kindnesse; depart at yourpleasure, and feare not the crossing of my Booke. So Gulfardo wentaway merily contented, and Ambrosia was served as she justlymerited; she paying the price of her owne leudnesse to her Husband,which she had a more covetous intent to keepe, questionlesse, notcaring how many like lustfull matches shee coulde make, to be soliberally rewarded, if this had succeeded to her minde: whereas heshewed himselfe wise and discreete, in paying nothing for hispleasure, and requiting a covetous queane in her kinde.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　APPROVING, THAT NO PROMISE IS TO BE KEPT WITH SUCH WOMEN AS WILL

　　MAKE SALE OF THEIR HONESTY FOR COYNE. A WARNING ALSO FOR MEN,

　　NOT TO SUFFER PRIESTS TO BE OVER FAMILIAR WITH

　　THEIR WIVES

　　A lustie youthfull Priest of Varlungo, fell in love with a prettywoman, named Monna Belcolore. To compasse his amorous desire, heelefte his Cloake (as a pledge of further payment) with her. By asubtile sleight afterward, he made meanes to borrow a Morter of her,which when hee sent home againe in the presence of her Husband; hedemaunded to have his Cloake sent him, as having left it in pawnefor the Morter. To pacifie her Husband, offended that shee did notlend the Priest the Morter without a pawne: she sent him backe hisCloake againe, albeit greatly against her will.

　　Both the Gentlemen and Ladies gave equall commendations, ofGulfardoes queint beguiling the Millaine Gentle-woman Ambrosia,andwishing all other (of her minde) might alwaies be so served. Thenthe Queene, smiling on Pamphilus, commaunded him to follow next:whereupon, thus he began.

　　I can tell you (faire Ladies) a short Novell, against such as arecontinually offensive to us, yet we being no way able to offend him;at least, in the same manner as they do injurie us. And for yourbetter understanding what and who they be, they are our lusty Priests,who advance their Standard, and make their publike predicationsagainst our wives, winning such advantage over them, that they canpardon them both of the sinne and punnishment, whensoever they areonce subjected unto theyr perswasions, even as if they brought theSoldane bound and captived, from Alexandria to Avignon. Whichimperious power, we (poore soules) cannot exercise on them,considering, we have neither heart nor courage, to do our devoire injust revenge on their Mothers, Sisters, Daughters, and Friends, withthe like spirit as they rise in armes against our wives. Andtherefore, I meane to tell you a tale of a Country mans wife, moreto make you laugh at the conclusion thereof; then for anysingularity of words or matter: yet this benefite you may gainethereby, of an apparant proofe, that such Sinamon, amorous andperswading Priests, are not alwayes to be credited on their words orpromises.

　　Let me then tell you, that at Varlungo, which you know to bee notfarre distant hence, there dwelt an youthfull Priest, lustie, gallant,and proper of person (especially for Womens service) commonly calledby the name of sweet Sir Simon. Now, albeit he was a man of slenderreading, yet notwithstanding, he had store of Latine sentences byheart; some true, but twice so many maimed and false, Saint-likeshewes, holy speeches, and ghostly admonitions, which hee would preachunder an Oake in the fields, when he had congregated hisParishioners together. When women lay in childebed, hee was theirdaily comfortable visitant, and would man them from their houses, whenthey had any occasion to walke abroad: carrying alwaies a bottle ofholy water about him, wherewith he would sprinkle them by the way,peeces of halowed Candles, and Chrisome Cakes, which pleased womenextraordinarily, and all the Country affoorded not such anotherfrolicke Priest, as this our nimble and active sweet Sir Simon.

　　Among many other of his feminine Parishioners, all of them beinghansome and comely Women: yet there was one more pleasing in hiswanton eye, then any of the rest, named Monna Belcolore, and wife to aplaine mecanicke man, called Bentivegna del Mazzo. And, to speakeuprightly, few Countrey Villages yeelded a Woman, more fresh andlovely of complexion, although not admirable for beauty, yet sweeteSir Simon thoght her a Saint, and faine would be offering at hershrine. Divers prety pleasing qualities she had, as sounding theCymball, playing artificially on the Timbrill, and singing theretoas it had beene a Nightingale, dancing also so dexteriously, ashappy was the man that could dance in her company. All which soenflamed sweet Sir Simon, that he lost his wonted sprightly behaviour,walked sullen, sad and melancholly, as if he had melted all hismettall, because hee could hardly have a sight of her. But on theSonday morning, when hee heard or knew that she was in the Church, heewould tickle it with a Kyrie and a Sancsingular skill in singing, whenit had beene as good to heare an Asse bray. Whereas on the contrary,when she came not to Church Masse, and all else were quicklie shakenuppe, as if his devotion waited onely on her presence. Yet he was socunning in the carriage of his amorous businesse, both for her crediteand his owne; as Bentivegna her husband could not perceive it, orany neighbor so much as suspect it.

　　But, to compaise more familiar acquaintance with Belcolore, hee senther sundry gifts and presents, day by day, as sometime a bunch ofdainty greene Garlicke, whereof he had plenty growing in his Garden,which he manured with his owne hands, and better then all the countreyyeelded; otherwhiles a small basket of Pease or Benes, and Onyons orScallions, as the season served. But when he could come in place whereshe was; then he darted amourous wincks and glances at her, withbecks, nods, and blushes, Loves private Ambassadours, which shee(being but countrey-bred) seeming by outward appearance, not to see,retorted disdainefully, and forthwith would absent her selfe, sothat sweet Sir Simon laboured still in vaine, and could not compassewhat he coveted.

　　It came to passe within a while after, that on a time, (about highnoone) Sir Simon being walking abroad, chanced to meete withBentivegna, driving an Asse before him, laden with divers commodities,and demaunding of him, whither he went, Bentivegna, thus answered.In troth Sir Simon, I am going to the City, about some especiallbusinesse of mine owne, and I carry these things to SigniorBonacorci da Ginestreto, because he should helpe me before theJudge, when I shall be called in question concerning my patrimony. SirSimon looking merily on him, said. Thou doest well Bentivegna, to makea friend sure before thou need him; goe, take my blessing with thee,and returne againe with good successe. But if thou meet with Laguccio,or Naldino, forget not to tell them, that they must bring me myshooe-tyes before Sunday. Bentivegna said, hee would discharge hiserrand, and so parted from him, driving his Asse on towards Florence.

　　Now began Sir Simon to shrug, and scratch his head, thinking this tobe a fit convenient time, for him to goe visite Belcolore, and to maketriall of his fortune: wherefore, setting aside all other businesse,he stayed no where till he came to the house, whereinto beingentred, he saide: All happinesse be to them that dwell heere.Belcolore being then above in the Chamber, when she heard histongue, replyed. Sweet Sir Simon! you are heartely welcome, whetherare you walking, if the question may bee demaunded? Beleeve medainty Ducke, answered Sir Simon, I am come to sit a while withthee, because I met thy Husband going to the Citie. By this time,Belcolore was descended downe the stayres, and having once againegiven welcome to Sir Simon, she sate downe by him, cleansing ofColewort seeds from such other course chaffe, which her Husband hadprepared before his departure.

　　Sir Simon hugging her in his armes, and fetching a vehement sigh,said. My Belcolore, how long shall I pine and languish for thy love?How now Sir Simon? answered she, is this behaviour fitting for an holyman? Holy-men Belcolore, (quoth Sir Simon) are made of the same matteras others be, they have the same affections, and therefore subjectto their infirmities. Santa Maria, answered Belcolore, Dare Priestsdoe such things as you talke of? Yes Belcolore (quoth he) and muchbetter then other men can, because they are made for the very bestbusinesse, in which regard they are restrained from marriage. True(quoth Belcolore) but much more from medling with other mens wives.Touch not that Text Belcolore, replyed Sir Simon, it is somewhat aboveyour capacity: talke of that I come for, namely thy love, my Ducke,and my Dove, Sir Simon is thine, I pray thee be mine.

　　Belcolore observing his smirking behaviour, his proper person,pretty talke, and queint insinuating; felt a motion to female frailty,which yet she would withstand so long as she could, and not beover-hasty in her yeelding. Sir Simon promiseth her a new paire ofshoes, garters, ribbands, girdles, or what else she would request. SirSimon (quoth she) all these things which you talke of, are fit forwomen: but if your love to mee be such as you make choice of,fulfill what I will motion to you, and then (perhaps) I shall tell youmore. Sir Simons heate made him hasty to promise whatsoever shewould desire; whereupon, thus shee replyed. On Saturday, said she, Imust goe to Florence, to carry home such yarne as was sent me tospinne, and to amend my spinning wheele: if you will lend mee tenFlorines, wherewith I know you are alwayes furnished, I shallredeeme from the Usurer my best peticote, and my wedding gowne (bothwell neere lost for lacke of repaiment) without which I cannot beseene at Church, or in any other good place else, and then afterwardother matters may be accomplished.

　　Alas sweete Belcolore answered Sir Simon, I never beare any such sumabout me, for men of our profession, doe seldome carry any money atall: but beleeve me on my word, before Saturday come, I will not faileto bring them hither. Oh Sir (quoth Belcolore) you men are quickepromisers, but slow performers. Doe you thinke to use me, as pooreBillezza was, who trusted to as faire words, and found her selfedeceived? Now Sir Simon, her example in being made scandall to theworld, is a sufficient warning for me: if you be not so provided,goe and make use of your friend, for I am not otherwise to be moved.Nay Belcolore (quoth he) I hope you will not serve me so, but myword shall be of better worth with you. Consider the conveniency oftime, wee being so privately here alone: whereas at my returninghither againe, some hinderance may thwart me, and the like opportunitybe never obtained. Sir, she) you have heard my resolution; if you willfetche the Florines, doe; otherwise, walke about your businesse, for Iam a woman of my word.

　　Sir Simon perceiving, that she would not trust him upon barewords, nor any thing was to be done, without Salvum me fac, whereashis meaning was Sine custodia; thus answered. Well Belcolove, seeingyou dare not credit my bringing the tenne Florines, according to mypromised day: I will leave you a good pawne, my very best Cloake,lyned quite thorough with rich Silke, and made up in the choysestmanner.

　　Belcolore looking on the Cloake, said. How much may this Cloakebee worth? How much? quoth Sir Simon, upon my word Belcolore, it is ofa right fine Flanders Serdge, and not above eight dayes since, Ibought it thus (ready made) of Lotto the Fripperer, and payed for itsixe and twenty Florines, a pledge then sufficient for your ten. Is itpossible, said shee, that it should cost so much? Well, Sir Simon,deliver it me first, I will lay it up safe for you against Saturday,when if you fetch it not; I will redeeme mine owne things with it, andleave you to release it your selfe.

　　The Cloake is laid up by Belcolore, and Sir Simon so forward inhis affection; that (in briefe) he enjoyed what hee came for; anddeparted afterward in his light tripping Cassocke, but yet thorowby-Lanes, and no much frequented places, smelling on a Nosegay, asif hee had beene at some wedding in the Countrey, and went thuslightly without his Cloake, for his better ease. As commonly afteractions of evill, Repentance knocketh at the doore of Conscience,and urgeth a guilty remembrance, with some sence of sorrow: so wasit now with sweet Sir Simon, who survayin over all his vailes ofoffering Candles, the validity of his yearely benefits, and allcomming nothing neere the summe of (scarce halfe) sixe and twentyFlorines; he began to repent his deed of darkenesse, although it wasacted in the day-time, and considered with himselfe, by what honest(yet unsuspected meanes) hee might recover his Cloake againe, beforeit went to the Broaker, in redemption of Belcolores pawnedapparrell, and yet to send her no Florines neither.

　　Having a cunning reaching wit, especially in matters for his owneadvantage, and pretending to have a dinner at his lodging, for a fewof some invited friends: he made use of a neighbours Boy, sendinghim to the house of Belcolore, with request of lending him her StoneMorter, to make Greenesawce in for his guests, because hee had meaterequired such sawce. Belcolore suspecting no treachery, sent him theStone Morter with the Pestell, and about dinner time, when he knewBentivegna to bee at home with his wife, by a spye which was set forthe purpose; hee called the Clearke (usually attending on him) andsaid. Take this Morter and Pestell, beare them home to Belcolore,and tell her: Sir Simon sends them home with thankes, they havingsufficiently served his turne, and desire her likewise, to send memy Cloake, which the Boy left as a pledge for better remembrance,and because she would not lend it without a pawne.

　　The Clearke comming to the house of Belcolore, found her sittingat dinner with her Husband, and delivering her the Pestell and Morter,performed the rest of Sir Simons message. Belcolore hearing the Cloakedemaunded, stept up to make answere: But Bentivegna, seeming (by hislookes) to be much offended, roughly replyed. Why how now wife? Is notSir Simon our especiall friend, and cannot he be pleasured without apawne? I protest upon my word, I could find in my heart to smitethee for it. Rise quickely thou wert best, and send him backe hisCloake; with this warning hereafter, that whatsoever he will have,be it your poore Asse, or any thing else being ours, let him haveit: and tell him (Master Clearke) he may command it. Belcolore rosegrumbling from the Table, and fetching the Cloake forth of theChest, which stood neere at hand in the same roome; shee deliveredit to the Clearke, saying. Tell Sir Simon from me, and boldly sayyou heard me speake it: that I make a vow to my selfe, he shallnever make use of my Morter hereafter, to beat any more of hissawcinesse in, let my Husband say whatsoever he will, I speake theword, and will performe it.

　　Away went the Clearke home with the Cloake, and told Sir Simonwhat she had said, whereto he replyed. If I must make use of herMorter no more; I will not trust her with the keeping of my Cloake,for feare it goe to gage indeed.

　　Bentivegna was a little displeased at his wives words, because heethought she spake but in jest; albeit Belcolore was so angry withSir Simon, that she would not speake to him till vintage timefollowing. But then Sir Simon, what by sharpe threatenings, of hersoule to be in danger of hell fire, continuing so long in hatred ofa holy Priest, which words did not a little terrifie her; besidesdaily presents to her, of sweet new Wines, roasted Chesse-nuts, Figgesand Almonds: all unkindnesse became converted to former familiarity;the garments were redeemed: he gave her Sonnets which she wouldsweetly sing to her Cimbale, and further friendship increased betweeneher and sweet Sir Simon.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　JUSTLY REPREHENDING THE SIMPLICITY OF SUCH MEN, AS ARE TOO MUCH

　　ADDICTED TO CREDULITIE, AND WILL GIVE CREDIT TO EVERY

　　THING THEY HEARE

　　Calandrino, Bruno, and Buffalmaco, all of them being Painters byprofession, travelled to the Plaine of Mugnone, to finde theprecious Stone called Helitropium. Calandrino no perswaded himselfe tohave found it; returned home to his house heavily loaden withstones. His Wife rebuking him for his absence, hee groweth into anger,and shrewdly beateth her. Afterward, when the case is debated amonghis other friends Bruno and Buffalmaco, all is found to be meerefoolery.

　　Pamphilus having ended his Novell, whereat the Ladies laughedexceedingly, so that very hardly they could give over. The Queene gavecharge to Madame Eliza, that shee should next succeed in order;when, being scarcely able to refraine from smyling, thus she began.

　　I know not (Gracious Ladies) whether I can move you to as heartylaughter, with a briefe Novell of mine owne, as Pamphilus lately didwith his: yet I dare assure you, that it is both true and pleasant,and I will relate it in the best manner I can.

　　In our owne Citie, which evermore hath contained all sorts ofpeople, not long since there dwelt, a Painter, named Calandrino, asimple man; yet as much adicted to matters of novelty, as any manwhatsoever could be. The most part of his time, he spent in thecompany of two other Painters, the one called Bruno, and the otherBuffalmaco, men of very recreative spirits, and of indifferent goodcapacity, often resorting to the said Calandrino, because they tookedelight in his honest simplicity, and pleasant order of behaviour.At the same time likewise, there dwelt in Florence, a yong Gentlemanof singular disposition, to every generous and witty conceite, asthe world did not yeeld a more pleasant companion, he being named Masodel Saggio, who having heard somwhat of Calandrinos sillinesse:determined to jest with him in merry manner, and to suggest hislonging humors after Novelties, with some conceit of extraordinarynature.

　　He happening (on a day) to meete him in the Church of Saint John,and seeing him seriously busied, in beholding the rare pictures, andthe curious carved Tabernacle, which (not long before) was placed onthe. high Altar in the said Church: considered with himselfe, thathe had now fit place and opportunity, to effect what hee had long timedesired. And having imparted his minde to a very intimate friend,how he intended to deale with simple Calandrino: they went both veryneere him, where he sate all alone, and making shew as if they saw himnot; began to consult between themselves, concerning the rareproperties of precious stones; whereof Maso discoursed as exactly,as he had beene a most skilfull Lapidarie; to which conference oftheirs, Calandrino lent an attentive eare, in regard it was matterof singular rarity.

　　Soone after, Calandrino started up, and perceiving by their loudespeaking, that they talked of nothing which required secretCounsell: he went into their company (the onely thing which Masodesired) and holding on still the former Argument; Calandrino wouldneeds request to know, in what place these precious stones were tobe found, which had such excellent vertues in them? Maso made answere,that the most of them were to be had in Berlinzona, neere to theCity of Bascha, which was in the Territory of a Countrey, calledBengodi, where the Vines were bound about with Sawcidges, a Goosewas sold for a penny, and the Goslings freely given in to boote. Therewas also an high mountaine wholly made of Parmezane, grated Cheese,whereon dwelt people, who did nothing else but make Mocharones andRavivolies, boyling them with broth of Capons, and afterward hurledthem all about, to whosoever can or will catch them. Neere to thismountaine runneth a faire River, the whole streame being pure whiteBastard, none such was ever sold for any money, and without one dropof water in it.

　　Now trust me Sir, (said Calandrino) that is an excellent Countrey todwell in: but I pray you tell me Sir, what do they with the Caponsafter they have boyld them? The Baschanes (quoth Maso) eate themall. Have you Sir, said Calandrino, at any time beene in thatCountrey? How? answered Maso, doe you demaund if have beene there? Yesman, above a thousand times, at the least. How farre Sir, I pray you(quoth Calandrino) is that worthy Countrey, from this our City? Introth, replyed Maso, the miles are hardly to be numbred, for themost part of them, we travell when we are nightly in our beddes, andif a man dreame right; he may be there upon a sudden.

　　Surely Sir, said Calandrino, it is further hence, then to Abruzzi?Yes questionlesse, replyed Maso; but, to a willing minde, no travellseemeth tedious.

　　Calandrino well noting, that Maso delivered all these speeches, witha stedfast countenance, no signe of smyling, or any gesture to urgethe least mislike: he gave such credit to them, as to any matter ofapparent and manifest truth, and upon this assured confidence, hesaid.

　　Beleeve me Sir, the journey is over-farre for mee to undertake,but if it were neerer; I could affoord to goe in your Company; onelyto see how they make these Macherones, and to fill my belly with them.

　　But now wee are in talke Sir, I pray you pardon mee to aske, whetherany such precious stones, as you spake off, are to be found in thatCountrey, or no? Yes indeed, replyed Maso, there are two kinds of themto be found in those Territories, both being of very great vertue. Onekind, are gritty stones, of Settignano, and of Montisca, by vertueof which places, when any Mill-stones or Grind-stones are to bee made,they knede the sand as they use to doe meale, and so make them of whatbignesse they please. In which respect, they have a common sayingthere: that Nature maketh common stones, but Montisca Mill-stones.Such plenty are there of these Mill-stones, so slenderly here esteemedamong us, as Emeralds are with them, whereof they have wholemountaines, farre greater then our Montemorello, which shine mostgloriously at midnight. And how meanly soever we account of theirMill-stones; yet there they drill them, and enchase them in Rings,which afterward they send to the great Soldane, and have whatsoeverthey will demaund for them.

　　The other kinde is a most precious Stone indeede, which our bestLapidaries call the Helitropium, the vertue whereof is so admirable;as whosoever beareth it about him, so long as he keepeth it, it isimpossible for any eye to discerne him, because he walketh meerelyinvisible. O Lord Sir (quoth Calandrino) those stones are of rarevertue indeede: but where else may a man finde that Helitropium?Whereto Maso thus answered: That Countrey onely doth not containethe Helitropium; for they be many times found upon our plaine ofMugnone. Of what bignesse Sir (quoth Calandrino) is the Stone, andwhat coulour? The Helitropium, answered Maso, is not alwayes of onequality, because some are bigge, and others lesse; but all are ofone coulour, namely blacke.

　　Calandrino committing all these things to respective memory, andpretending to be called thence by some other especiall affaires;departed from Maso, concluding resolvedly with himselfe, to finde thisprecious stone, if possibly hee could: yet intending to doe nothing,untill hee had acquainted Bruno and Buffalmaco therewith, whom heloved dearly: he went in all hast to seeke them; because, (without anylonger trifling the time) they three might bee the first men, thatshould find out this precious stone, spending almost the whole morningbefore they were all three met together. For they were painting at theMonastery of the Sisters of Faenza, where they had very seriousimployment, and followed their businesse diligently: where havingfound them, and saluting them in such kinde manner, as continuallyhe used to doe, thus he began.

　　Loving friends, if you were pleased to follow mine advise, wee threewill quickely be the richest men in Florence; because, byinformation from a Gentleman (well deserving to be credited) on thePlaine of Mugnone: there is a precious stone to be found, whichwhosoever carrieth it about him, walketh invisible, and is not to beseene by any one. Let us three be the first men to goe and finde it,before any other heare thereof, and goe about it, and assure ourselves that we shall finde it, for I know it (by discription) so sooneas I see it. And when wee have it, who can hinder us from bearing itabout us? Then will we goe to the Tables of our Bankers, or moneyChangers, which we see daily charged with plenty of gold and silver,where we may take so much as wee list, for they (nor any) are ableto descrie us. So, (in short time) shall wee all be wealthy, neverneeding to drudge any more, or paint muddy walles, as hitherto we havedone; and, as many of our poore profession are forced to doe.

　　Bruno and Buffalmaco hearing this, began to smile, and lookingmerily each on other, they seemed to wonder thereat, and greatlycommended the counsell of Calandrino. Buffalmaco demaunding how thestone was named. Now it fortuned, that Calandrino (who had but agrosse and blockish memory) had quite forgot the name of the stone,and therefore said. What neede have wee of the name, when we know, andare assured of the stones vertue? Let us make no more adoe, but(setting aside all other businesse) goe seeke where it is to be found.Well my friend (answered Bruno) you say wee may finde it, but how, andby what meanes?

　　There are two sorts of them (quoth Calandrino) some bigge, otherssmaller, but all carry a blacke colour: therefore (in mine opinion)let us gather all such stones as are blacke, so shall we be sure tofinde it among them, without any further losse of time.

　　Buffalmaco and Bruno, liked and allowed the counsell ofCalandrino, which when they had (by severall commendations) givenhim assurance of, Bruno saide. I doe not thinke it a convenient timenow, for us to go about so weighty a businesse: for the Sun is yetin the highest degree, and striketh such a heate on the plaine ofMugnone, as all the stones are extreamly dryed, and the veryblackest will nowe seeme whitest. But in the morning, after the dew isfalne, and before the Sunne shineth forth, every stone retaineth histrue colour. Moreover, there be many Labourers now working on theplaine, about such businesse as they are severally assigned, whoseeing us in so serious a serch: may imagine what we seeke for, andpartake with us in the same inquisition, by which meanes they maychance to speed before us, and so wee may lose both our trot andamble. Wherefore, by my consent, if your opinion jumpe with mine, thisis an enterprize onely to be perfourmed in an early morning, whenthe blacke stones are to be distinguisht from the white, and aFestivall day were the best of all other, for then there will benone to discover us.

　　Buffalmaco applauded the advice of Bruno, and Calandrino did nolesse, concluding all together; that Sunday morning (next ensuing)should be the time, and then they all three would go see the Stone.But Calandrino was verie earnest with them, that they shold notreveale it to any living body, because it was tolde him as anespeciall secret: disclosing further to them, what hee had heardconcerning the Countrey of Bengodi, maintaining (with solemn oaths andprotestations) that every part thereof was true. Uppon this agreement,they parted from Calandrino who hardly enjoyed anie rest at all,either by night or day, so greedie he was to bee possessed of thestone. On the Sonday morning, hee called up his Companions beforebreake of day, and going forth at S. Galls Port, they stayed not, tillthey came to the plaine of Mugnone, where they searched all about tofinde this strange stone.

　　Calandrino went stealing before the other two, and verilie perswadedhimselfe, that he was borne to finde the Helitropium, and looking onevery side about him, hee rejected all other Stones but the blacke,whereof first he filled his bosome, and afterwards, both hisPockets. Then he tooke off his large painting Apron, which he fastenedwith his girdle in the manner of a sacke, and that he filled full ofstones likewise. Yet not so satisfied, he spred abroad his Cloake,which being also full of stones, hee bound it up carefully, forfeare of loosing the very least of them. All which Buffalmaco andBruno well observing (the day growing on, and hardly they couldreach home by dinner time) according as merrily they had concluded,and pretending not to see Calandrino, albeit he was not farre fromthem: What is become of Calandrino? saide Buffalmaco. Bruno gazingstrangely every where about him, as if hee were desirous to finde him,replyed. I saw him not long since, for then he was hard by beforeus; questionlesse, he hath given us the slippe, is privilie gonehome to dinner, and making starke fooles of us, hath lefte us to pickeup blacke stones, upon the parching plaines of Mugnone. Well (quothBuffalmaco) this is but the tricke of an hollow-hearted friend, andnot such as he protested himselfe to be, to us. Could any but wee havebin so sottish, to credit his frivolous perswasions, hoping to findeany stones of such vertue, and here on the fruitlesse plains ofMugnone? No, no, none but we would have beleeved him.

　　Calandrino (who was close by them) hearing these wordes, andseeing the whole manner of their wondering behaviour: becameconstantly perswaded, that hee had not onely found the precious stone;but also had some store of them about him, by reason he was so neereto them, and yet they could not see him, therefore he walked beforethem. Now was his joy beyond all compasse of expression, and beingexceedingly proud of so happy an adventure: did not meane to speakeone word to them, but (heavily laden as hee was) to steale homefaire and softly before them, which indeede he did, leaving them tofollow after, if they would. Bruno perceiving his intent, said toBuffalmaco: What remaineth now for us to doe? Why should not we gohome, as well as hee? And reason too, replyed Bruno. It is in vaine totarry any longer heere: but I solemnly protest, Calandrino shall nomore make an Asse of me: and were I now as neere him, as not longsince I was, I would give him such a remembrance on the heele withthis Flint stone, as should sticke by him this moneth, to teach hima lesson for abusing his friends.

　　Hee threw the stone, and hit him shrewdly on the heele therewith;but all was one to Calandrino, whatsoever they saide, or did, asthus they still followed after him. And although the blow of the stonewas painfull to him; yet he mended his pace so wel as he was able,in regard of beeing over-loaden with stones, and gave them not oneword all the way, because he tooke himselfe to bee invisible, andutterly unseene of them. Buffalmaco taking uppe another Flintstone,which was indifferent heavie and sharp, said to Bruno. Seest thou thisFlint? Casting it from him, he smote Calandrino just in the backetherewith, saying that Calandrino had bin so neere as I might have hithim on the backe with the stone. And thus all the way on the plaine ofMugnone, they did nothing else but pelt him with stones, even so farreas the Port of S. Gall, where they threwe downe what other stones theyhad gathered, meaning not to molest him any more, because they haddone enough already.

　　There they stept before him unto the Port, and acquainted theWarders with the whole matter, who laughing heartily at the jest,the better to upholde it; would seeme not to see Calandrino in hispassage by them, but suffered him to go on, sore wearied with hisburthen, and sweating extreamly. Without resting himselfe in anyplace, he came home to his house, which was neere to the corner of theMilles, Fortune being so favourable to him in the course of thismockery, that as he passed along the Rivers side, and afterwardthrough part of the City; he was neither met nor seen by any, inregard they were all in their houses at dinner.

　　Calandrino, every minute ready to sinke under his weightieburthen, entred into his owne house, where (by great ill luck) hiswife, being a comely and very honest woman, and named Monna Trista,was standing aloft on the stayres head. She being somewhat angry forhis so long absence, and seeing him come in grunting and groaning,frowningly said. I thought that the divell would never let thee comehome, all the whole Citie have dined, and yet wee must remaine withoutour dinner. When Calandrino heard this, and perceived that he wasnot invisible to his Wife: full of rage and wroth, hee began to raile,saying. Ah thou wicked woman, where art thou? Thou hast utterly undoneme: but (as I live) I will pay thee soundly for it. Up the staireshe ascended into a small Parlour, where when he hadde spred all hisburthen of stones on the floore: he ran to his wife, catching frerby the haire of the head, and throwing her at his feete; giving her somany spurns and cruel blowes, as shee was not able to moove eitherarmes or legges, notwithstanding all her teares, and humblesubmission.

　　Now Buffalmaco and Bruno, after they had spent an indifferent while,with the Warders at the Port in laughter; in a faire and gentlepace, they followed Calandrino home to his house, and being come tothe doore, they heard the harsh bickering betweene him and his Wife,and seeming as if they were but newly arrived, they called out alowdto him. Calandrino being in a sweate, stamping and raving still at hisWife: looking forth of the window, entreated them to ascend up to him,which they did, counterfetting greevous displeasure against him. Beingcome into the roome, which they saw all covered over with stones,his Wife sitting in a corner, all the haire (well-neere) torne off herhead, her face broken and bleeding, and all her body cruelly beaten;on the other side, Calandrino standing unbraced and ungirded,strugling and wallowing, like a man quite out of breath: after alittle pausing, Bruno thus spake.

　　Why how now Calandrino? What may the meaning of this matter be?What, art thou preparing for building, that thou hast provided suchplenty of stones? How sitteth thy poore wife? How hast thou misusedher? Are these the behaviours of a wise or honest man? Calandrino,over-spent with travalle, and carrying such an huge burthen of stones,as also the toylesome beating of his Wife, (but much more impatientand offended, for that high good Fortune, which he imagined to havelost:) could not collect his spirits together, to answer them oneready word, wherefore hee sate fretting like a mad man. Whereupon,Buffalmaco thus began to him. Calandrino, if thou be angry with anyother, yet thou shouldest not have made such a mockery of us, asthou hast done: in leaving us (like a couple of coxcombes) to theplaine of Mugnone, whether thou leddest us with thee, to seeke aprecious stone called Helitropium. And couldst thou steale home, neverbidding us so much as farewell? How can we but take it in very evillpart, that thou shouldest so abuse two honest neighbours? Well, assurethy selfe, this is the last time that ever thou shalt serve us so.

　　Calandrino (by this time) being somewhat better come to himselfe,with an humble protestation of courtesie, returned them this answer.Alas my good friends, be not you offended, the case is farre otherwisethen you immagine. Poore unfortunate man that I am, I found the rareprecious stone that you speake of: and marke me well, if I do not tellyou the truth of all. When you asked one another (the first time) whatwas become of me; I was hard by you: at the most, within thedistance of two yards length; and perceiving that you saw mee not,(being still so neere, and alwaies before you:) I went on, smilingto my selfe, to heare you brabble and rage against me.

　　So, proceeding on in his discourse, he recounted every accident asit hapned, both what they had saide and did unto him, concerning theseverall blowes, with the two Flint-stones, the one hurting himgreevously in the heele, and the other paining him as extreamly in thebacke, with their speeches used then, and his laughter,notwithstanding hee felt the harme of them both, yet beeing proud thathe did so invisibly beguile them. Nay more (quoth he) I cannotforbeare to tell you, that when I passed thorow the Port, I saw youstanding with the Warders; yet, by vertue of that excellent Stone,undiscovered of you all. Beside, going along the streets, I met manyof my Gossips, friends, and familiar acquaintance, such as used daylieto converse with me, and drinking together in every Tavern: yet notone of them spake to me, neyther used any courtesie or salutation;which (indeede) I did the more freely forgive them, because theywere not able to see me.

　　In the end of all when I was come home into mine owne house, thisdivellish and accursed woman, being aloft uppon my stayres head, bymuch misfortune chanced to see me; in regard (as it is not unknowne toyou) that women cause all things to lose their vertue. In whichrespect, I that could have stild my selfe the onely happy man inFlorence, am now made most miserable. And therefore did I justly beateher, so long as she was able to stand against mee, and I know noreason to the contrary, why I should not yet teare her in a thousandpeeces: for I may well curse the day of our mariage, to hinder andbereave me of such an invisible blessednesse.

　　Buffalmaco and Bruno hearing this, made shew of verie muchmervailing thereat, and many times maintained what Calandrino hadsaid; being well neere ready to burst with laughter; considering,how confidently he stood upon it, that he had found the wonderfulstone, and lost it by his wives speaking onely to him. But when theysaw him rise in fury once more, with intent to beat her againe: thenthey stept betweene them; affirming, That the woman had no wayoffended in this case, but rather he himself: who knowing that womencause all things to lose their vertue, had not therefore expreslycommanded her, not to be seene in his presence all that day, untill hehad made full proofe of the stones vertue. And questionles, theconsideration of a matter so availeable and important, was quite takenfrom him, because such an especiall happinesse, should not belong tohim only; but (in part) to his friends, whom he had acquaintedtherewith, drew them to the plaine with him in companie, where theytooke as much paines in serch of the stone, as possibly he did, orcould; and yet (dishonestly) he would deceive them, and beare itaway covetously, for his owne private benefit.

　　After many other, as wise and wholesome perswasions, which heconstantly credited, because they spake them, they reconciled him tohis wife, and she to him: but not without some difficulty in him;who falling into wonderfull greefe and melancholy, for losse of suchan admirable precious stone, was in danger to have dyed, withinlesse then a month after.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, HOW LOVE OFTENTIMES IS SO POWERFULL IN AGED

　　MEN, AND DRIVETH THEM TO SUCH DOATING, THAT IT

　　REDOUNDETH TO THEIR GREAT DISGRACE AND PUNISHMENT

　　The Provost belonging to the Cathedrall Church of Fiesola, fell inlove with a Gentlewoman, being a widdow, and named Piccarda, who hatedhim as much as he loved her. He imagining, that he lay with her: bythe Gentlewomans Bretheren, and the Byshop under whom he served, wastaken in bed with her Mayde, an ugly, foule, deformed Slut.

　　Ladie Eliza having concluded her Novell, not without infinitecommendations of the whole company: the Queen turning her lookes toMadame Aimillia, gave her such an expresse signe, as she must needsfollow next after Madame Eliza, whereupon she began in this manner.

　　Vertuous Ladies, I very well remember (by divers Novels formerlyrelated) that sufficient hath beene sayde, concerning Priests andReligious persons, and all other carrying shaven Crownes, in theirluxurious appetites and desires. But because no one can at any timesay so much, as thereto no more may be added: beside them alreadiespoken of, I wil tel you another concerning the Provost of a CathedralChurch, who would needes (in despight of all the world) love aGentlewoman whether she would or no: and therefore, in duechastisement both unto his age and folly, she gave him suchentertainment as he justly deserved.

　　It is not unknowne unto you all, that the Cittie of Fieosola, themountaine whereof we may very easily hither discerne, hath bene (intimes past) a very great and most ancient City: although at this dayit is wellneere all ruined: yet neverthelesse, it alwaies was, and yetis a Byshops See, albeit not of the wealthiest. In the same Citie, andno long while since, neere unto the Cathedrall Church, there dwelt aGentlewoman, being a Widdow, and commonlie there stiled by the name ofMadame Piccarda, whose house and inheritance was but small,wherewith yet she lived very contentedly (having no wandering eye,or wanton desires) and no company but her two Brethren, Gentlemen ofespeciall honest and gracious disposition.

　　This Gentlewoman, being yet in the flourishing condition of hertime, did ordinarily resort to the Cathedrall Church in holie zeale,and religious devotion; where the Provost of the place, became soenamored of her, as nothing (but the sight of her) yeelded him anycontentment. Which fond affection of his, was forwarded with such anaudacious and bold carriage, as hee dared to acquaint her with hislove, requiring her enterchange of affection, and the like opinionof him, as he had of her. True it is, that he was very farre entredinto yeares, but yong and lustie in his own proud conceite,presuming strangely beyond his capacity, and thinking as well of hisabilitie, as the youthfullest gallant in the World could doe.Whereas (in verie deede) his person was utterly displeasing, hisbehaviour immodest and scandaious, and his usuall Language,savouring of such sensualitie, as, very fewe or none cared for hiscompany. And if any Woman seemed respective of him, it was in regardof his outside and profession, and more for feare, then the leastaffection, and alwayes as welcome to them, as the head-ake.

　　His fond and foolish carriage stil continuing to this Gentlewoman;she being wise and vertuously advised, spake thus unto him. HolySir, if you love me according as you protest, and manifest by youroutward behaviour: I am the more to thanke you for it, being boundin dutie to love you likewise. But if your Love have any harshe orunsavourie taste, which mine is no way able to endure, neyther dareentertaine in anie kinde whatsoever: you must and shall hold meeexcused, because I am made of no such temper. You are my ghostly andspirituall Father, an Holy Priest. Moreover, yeares have made youhonorably aged; all which severall weighty considerations, ought toconfirme you in continency and chastity. Remember withall (good sir)that I am but a child to you in years, and were I bent to any wantonappetites, you shold justly correct me by fatherly counsell, such asmost beautifieth your sacred profession. Beside, I am a Widdow, andyou are not ignorant, how requisite a thing honestie is in widdowes.Wherefore, pardon mee (Holy Father:) for, in such manner as you makethe motion: I desire you not to love mee, because I neither can orwill at any time so affect you.

　　The Provoste gaining no other grace at this time, would not sogive over for this first repulse, but pursuing her still withunbeseeming importunity; many private meanes he used to her byLetters, tokens, and insinuating ambassages; yea, whensoever shee cameto the Church, he never ceased his wearisome solicitings. Whereatshe growing greatly offended, and perceyving no likelyhood of hisdesisting; became so tyred with his tedious suite, that she consideredwith her selfe, how she might dispatch him as he deserved, because shesaw no other remedy. Yet shee would not attempte anie thing in thiscase, without acquainting her Bretheren first therwith. And havingtolde them, how much shee was importuned by the Provost, and also whatcourse she meant to take (wherin they both counselled and encouragedher:) within a few daies after, shee went to Church as she was wont todo; where so soone as the Provost espyed her: forthwith he came toher, and according to his continued course, he fell into his amorouscourting. She looking upon him with a smiling countenance, and walkingaside with him out of any hearing: after he had spent many impertinentspeeches, shee (venting foorth manie a vehement sighe) at lengthreturned him this answer.

　　Reverend Father, I have often heard it saide: That there is notany Fort or Castle, how strongly munited soever it bee; but bycontinuall assayling, at length (of necessity) it must and will besurprized. Which comparison, I may full well allude to my selfe.For, you having so long time solicited me, one while with affablelanguage, then againe with tokens and entisements, of suchprevailing power: as have broken the verie barricado of my formerdeliberation, and yeelded mee uppe as your prisoner, to be commandedat your pleasure for now I am onely devoted yours.

　　Well may you (Gentle Ladies) imagine, that this answere was not alittle welcome to the Provost; who, shrugging with conceyte of joy,presently thus replyed. I thanke you Madame Piccarda, and to tellyou true, I held it almost as that you could stand upon such longresistance, considering, it never so fortuned to mee with anieother. And I have many times saide to my selfe, that if women weremade of silver, they hardly could be worth a pennie, because there canscarsely one be found of so good allay, as to endure the test andessay. But let us breake off this frivolous conference, and resolveupon a conclusion; How, when and where we may safely meete together.Worthy Sir, answered Piccarda, your selfe may appoint the timewhensoever you please, because I have no Husband, to whom I shouldrender any account of my absence, or presence: but I am not providedof any place.

　　A pretty while the Provoste stood musing, and at last saide. A placeMadame? where can be more privacie, then in your owne house? AlasSir (quoth she) you know that I have two Gentlemen my brethren, whocontinually are with me, and other of their friends beside: My housealso is not great, wherefore it is impossible to be there, exceptyou could be like a dumbe man, without speaking one word, or makingthe very least noyse; beside, to remaine in darkenesse, as if you wereblinde, and who can be able to endure all these? And yet (withoutthese) there is no adventuring, albeit they never come into myChamber: but their lodging is so close to mine, as there cannot anyword be spoken, be it never so low or in whispering manner, but theyheare it very easily. Madame said the Provoste, for one or two nights,I can make hard shift. Why Sir (quoth she) the matter onelyremaineth in you, for if you be silent and suffering, as already youhave heard, there is no feare at all of safty. Let me alone Madame,replyed the Provoste, I will be governed by your directions: but, inany case, let us begin this night. With all my heart, saide shee. Soappointing him how, and when hee should come; hee parted from her, andshee returned home to her house.

　　Heere I am to tell you, that this Gentlewoman had a servant, inthe nature of an old maide, not indued with any well featured face,but instead thereof, she had the ugliest and most counterfeitcountenance, as hardly could be seene a worse. She had a wrie mouth,huge great lippes, foule teeth, great and blacke, a monstrous stinkingbreath, her eyes bleared, and alwayes running, the complexion of herface betweene greene and yellow, as if shee had not spent the Summerseason in the Citie, but in the parching Countrey under a hedge; andbeside all these excellent parts, shee was crooke backt, poult footed,and went like a lame Mare in Fetters. Her name was Ciuta, but inregard of her flat nose, lying as low as a Beagles, shee was calledCiutazza. Now, notwithstanding all this deformity in her, yet shehad a singuler opinion of her selfe, as commonly all such fouleSluts have: in regard whereof, Madame Piccarda calling her aside, thusbegan.

　　Ciutazza, if thou wilt doe for me one nights service, I shall bestowon thee a faire new Smocke. When Ciutazza heard her speake of a newSmocke, instantly she answered. Madame, if you please to bestow anew Smocke on me, were it to runne thorow the fire for you, or anybusinesse of farre greater danger, you onely have the power to commandme, and I will doe it. I will not (said Piccarda) urge thee to anydangerous action, but onely to lodge in my bed this night with aman, and give him courteous entertainement, who shall reward theeliberally for it. But have an especiall care that thou speake notone word, for feare thou shouldst be heard by my Brethren, who (asthou knowest) lodge so neere by; doe this, and then demaund thy Smockeof me. Madame (quoth Ciutazza) if it were to lye with sixe men, ratherthen one; if you say the word, it shall be done.

　　When night was come, the Provoste also came according toappointment, even when two brethren were in their lodging, they easilyheard his entrance, as Piccarda (being present with them) had informedthem. In went the Provoste without any candle, or making the leastnoise to be heard, and being in Piccardaes Chamber, went to bed:Ciutazza tarrying not long from him, but (as her Mistresse hadinstructed her) she went to bed likewise, not speaking any word atall, and the Provoste, imagining to have her there, whom he sohighly affected, fell to imbracing and kissing Ciutazza, who was asforward in the same manner to him, and there for a while I intend toleave them.

　　When Piccarda had performed this hot piece of businesse, shereferred the effecting of the remainder to her Brethren, in suchsort as it was compacted betweene them. Faire and softly went thetwo brethren forth of their Chamber, and going to the Market place,Fortune was more favourable to them then they could wish, inaccomplishing the issue of their intent. For the heat being somwhattedious, the Lord Bishop was walking abroad very late, with purpose tovisit the Brethren at the Widdowes house, because he tooke greatdelight in their company, as being good Schollers, and endued withother singular parts beside. Meeting with them in the open Marketplace, he acquainted them with his determination; whereof they werenot a little joyfull, it jumping so justly with their intent.

　　Being come to the Widdowes house, they passed through a smalnether Court, where lights stood ready to welcome him thither; andentring into a goodly Hall, there was store of good wine andbanquetting, which the Bishop accepted in very thankefull manner:and courteous complement being overpassed, one of the Brethren, thusspake. My good Lord, seeing it hath pleased you to honour our pooreWiddowed Sisters house with your presence, for which wee shallthanke you while we live: We would intreate one favour more of you,onely but to see a sight which we will shew you. The Lord Bishop waswell contented with the motion: so the Brethren conducting him bythe hand, brought him into their Sisters Chamber, where the Provostewas in bed with Ciutazza, both soundly sleeping, but enfolded in hisarmes, as wearied (belike) with their former wantonning, and whereofhis age had but little need.

　　The Courtaines being close drawne about the bed, although the seasonwas exceeding hot, they having lighted Torches in their hands; drewopen the Curtaines, and shewed the Bishop his Provoste, close snuggingbetweene the armes of Ciutazza. Upon a sudden the Provoste awaked, andseeing so great a light, as also so many people about him: shame andfeare so daunted him, that hee shrunke downe in the bed, and hid hishead. But the Bishop being displeased at a sight so unseemely, madehim to discover his head againe, to see whom he was in bed withall.Now the poore Provoste perceiving the Gentlewomans deceite, and theproper hansome person so sweetly embracing him: it made him soconfounded with shame, as he had not the power to utter one word:but having put on his cloathes by the Bishops command, hee sent him(under sufficient guard) to his Pallace, to suffer due chastisementfor his sinne committed; and afterward he desired to know, by whatmeanes hee became so favoured of Ciutazza, the whole Historie whereof,the two brethren related at large to him.

　　When the Bishop had heard all the discourse, highly he commended thewisedome of the Gentlewoman, and worthy assistance of her brethren,who contemning to soile their hands in the blood of a Priest, rathersought to shame him as hee deserved. The Bishop enjoyned him apennance of repentance for forty dayes after, but love and disdainemade him weepe nine and forty: Moreover, it was a long while after,before he durst be seene abroad. But when he came to walke thestreets, the Boyes would point their fingers at him, saying. Beholdthe Provoste that lay with Ciutazza: Which was such a wearisome lifeto him, that he became (well neere) distracted in his wits. In thismanner the honest Gentlewoman discharged her dutie, and rid herselfe of the Provosts importunity: Ciutazza had a merry night of it,and a new Smocke also for her labour.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　GIVING ADMONITION, THAT FOR THE MANAGING OF PUBLIQUE AFFAIRES, NO

　　OTHER PERSONS ARE OR OUGHT TO BE APPOINTED, BUT SUCH AS BE HONEST,

　　AND MEET TO SIT ON THE SEATE OF AUTHORITY

　　Three pleasant Companions, plaide a merry pranke with a Judge(belonging to the Marquesate of Ancona) at Florence, at such time ashe sate on the Bench, and hearing criminall causes.

　　No sooner had Madam Aemillia finished her Novell, wherin, theexcellent wisdome of Piccarda, for so worthily punishing the luxuriousold Provoste, had generall commendations of the whole Assembly: butthe Queene, looking on Philostratus, said. I command you next tosupply the place: whereto he made answere, that hee was both ready andwilling, and then thus began. Honourable Ladies, the merryGentleman, so lately remembred by Madame Eliza, being named Maso delSaggio; causeth me to passe over an intended Tale, which I hadresolved on when it came to my turne: to report another concerninghim, and two men more, his friendly Companions. Which although itmay appeare to you somewhat unpleasing, in regard of a little grosseand unmannerly behaviour: yet it will move merriment without anyoffence, and that is the maine reason why I relate it.

　　It is not unknowne to you, partly by intelligence from ourreverend predecessours, as also some understanding of your owne,that many time have resorted to our City of Florence, Potestates andOfficers, belonging to the Marquesate of Anconia; who commonly weremen of lowe spirit, and their lives so wretched and penurious, as theyrather deserved to be tearmed Misers, then men. And in regard ofthis their naturall covetousnesse and misery, the Judges would bringalso in their company, such Scribes or Notaries, as being paraleldewith their Masters: they all seemed like Swaines come from the Plough,or bred up in some Coblers quality, rather then Schollers, or Studentsof Law.

　　At one time (above all the rest) among other Potestates andJudges, there came an especiall man, as pickt out of purpose, whowas named Messer Niccolao da San Lepidio, who (at the first beholding)looked rather like a Tinker, then any Officer in authority. Thishansome man (among the rest) was deputed to heare criminall causes.And, as often it happeneth, that Citizens, although no businesseinviteth them to Judiciall Courts, yet they still resort thither,sometimes accidentally: So it fortuned, that Maso times del Saggio,being one morning in search of an especiall friend, went to theCourt-house, and being there, observed in what manner MesserNiccolao was seated; who looking like some strange Fowle, latelycome forth of a farre Countrey; he began to survay him the moreseriously, even from the head to the foot, as we use to say.And albeit he saw his Gowne furred with Miniver, as also the hoodabout his necke, a Penne and Inkehorne hanging at his girdle, andone skirt of his Garment longer then the other, with more misshapensights about him, farre unfitting for a man of so civill profession:yet he spyed one errour extraordinary, the most notable (in hisopinion) that ever he had seene before. Namely, a paultry paire ofBreeches, wickedly made, and worse worne, hanging downe lowe ashalfe his legge, even as he sate upon the Bench, yet cut sosparingly of the Cloath, that they gaped wide open before, as awheele-barrow might have full entrance allowed it. This strangesight was so pleasing to him; as leaving off further search of hisfriend, and scorning to have such a spectacle alone by himselfe: heewent upon another Inquisition; Namely, for two other merry Lads likehirnselfe, the one being called Ribi, and the other Matteuzzo, menof the same mirth-full disposition as he was, and therefore the fitterfor his Company.

　　After he had met with them, these were his salutations: My honestBoyes, if ever you did me any kindnesse, declare it more effectuallynow, in accompanying me to the Court-house, where you shall beholdsuch a singular spectacle, as (I am sure) you never yet saw thelike. Forthwith they went along altogether, and being come to theCourthouse, he shewed them the Judges hansome paire of Breeches,hanging down in such base and beastly manner; that (being as yet farreoff from the Bench) their hearts did ake with extreamity oflaughter. But when they came neere to the seat whereon Messer Niccolaosate, they plainely perceived, that it was very easie to be creptunder, and withall, that the board whereon he set his feet, was rottenand broken, so that it was no difficult matter, to reach it, andpull it downe as a man pleased, and let him fall bare Breecht to theground. Cheare up your spirits (my hearts) quoth Maso, and if yourlonging be like to mine; we will have yonder Breeches a good dealelower, for I see how it may be easily done.Laying their heads together, plotting and contriving severallwayes, which might be the likelyest to, compasse their intent: each ofthem had his peculiar appointment, to undertake the businessewithout fayling and it was to be performed the next morning. At thehoure assigned, they met there againe, and finding the Court wellfilled with people, the Plaintiffes and Defendants earnestly pleading:Matteuzzo (before any body could descry him) was cunningly crept underthe Bench, and lay close by the board whereon the Judge placed hisfeete. Then stept in Maso on the right hand of Messer Niccolao, andtooke fast hold on his Gowne before; the like did Ribi on the lefthand, in all respects answerable to the other. Oh my Lord Judge (cryedMaso out aloud) I humbly intreat you for charities sake, before thispilfering knave escape away from hence; that I may have justiceagainst him, for stealing my drawing-over stockeings, which he stoutlydenyeth, yet mine owne eyes beheld the deed, it being now not abovefifteene dayes since, when first I bought them for mine owne use.

　　Worthy Lord Judge (cryed Ribi, on the other side) doe not beleevewhat he saith, for he is a paltry lying fellow, and because hee knew Icame hither to make my complaint for a Male or Cloakebag which hestole from me: hee urgeth this occasion for a paire of drawingStockeings, which he delivered me with his owne hands. If yourLordship will not credit me, I can produce as witnesses, Trecco theShoemaker, with Monna Grassa the Souse-seller, and he that sweepes theChurch of Santa Maria a Verzaia, who saw him when he came postinghither. Maso haling and tugging the Judge by the sleeve, would notsuffer him to heare Ribi, but cryed out still for justice against him,as he did the like on the contrary side.

　　During the time of this their clamourous contending, the Judge beingvery willy willing to heare either party: Matteuzzo, upon a signereceived from the other, which was a word in Masoes pleading, laideholde on the broken boord, as also on the Judges low-hanging Breech,plucking at them both so strongly, that they fell downe immediately,the Breeches being onely tyed but with one Poynt before. He hearingthe boards breaking underneath him, and such maine pulling at hisBreeches; strove (as he sate) to make them fast before, but thePoynt being broken, and Maso crying in his eare on the one side, asRibi did the like in the other; hee was at his wits end to defendhimselfe. My Lord (quoth Maso) you may bee ashamed that you doe me notjustice, why will you not heare mee, but wholly lend your eare to mineAdversary? My Lord (said Ribi) never was Libell preferd into thisCourt, of such a paltry trifling matter, and therefore I must, andwill have Justice.

　　By this time the Judge was dismounted from the Bench, and stood onthe ground, with his slovenly Breeches hanging about his heeles:Matteuzzo being cunningly stolne away, and undiscovered by any body.Ribi, thinking he had shamed the Judge sufficiently, went away,protesting, that he would declare his cause in the hearing of awiser Judge. And Maso forbearing to tugge his Gowne any longer, in hisdeparting, said. Fare you well Sir, you are not worthy to be aMagistrate, if you have no more regard of your honour and honesty, butwill put off poore mens suites at your pleasure. So both went severallwayes, and soone were gone out of publike view.

　　The worshipfull Judge Messer Niccolao stood all this while on theground; and, in presence of all the beholders, trussed up hisBreeches, as if-hee were new risen out of his bed: when betterbethinking himselfe on the matters indifference, he called for the twomen, who contended for the drawing stockings and the Cloake-bag; butno one could tell what was become of them. Whereupon, he rapt out akinde of Judges oath, saying: I will know whether it be Law or noheere in Florence, to make a Judge sit bare Breecht on the Bench ofJustice, and in the hearing of criminall Causes; whereat the chiefePotestate, and all the standers by laughed heartily.

　　Within fewe dayes after, he was informed by some of his especiallFriends, that this had never happened to him, but onely to testifie,how understanding the Florentines are, in their ancientconstitutions and customes, to embrace, love and honour, honest,discreet worthy Judges and Magistrates; Whereas on the contrary,they as much condemne miserable knaves, fooles, and dolts, who nevermerit to have any better entertainment. Wherefore, it would be bestfor him, to make no more enquiry after the parties; lest a worseinconvenience should happen to him.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE SIXT NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED, HOW EASILY A PLAINE AND SIMPLE MAN MAY BE

　　MADE A FOOLE, WHEN HE DEALETH WITH CRAFTY COMPANIONS.

　　Bruno and Buffalmaco, did steale a young Brawne from Calandrino, andfor his recovery thereof, they used a kinde of pretendedconjuration, with Pilles made of Ginger and strong Malmesey. Butinstead of this application, they on, they gave him two Pilles of aDogges Dates, or Dowsets, confected in Alloes, which he receivedeach after the other by meanes whereof they made him beleeve, that heehad robde himselfe. And for feare they should report this theft to hisWife; they made him to goe buy another Brawne.

　　Philostratus had no sooner concluded his Novell, and the wholeAssembly laughed Madame thereat: but the Queen gave command toMadame Philomena, that shee should follow next in order; whereuponthus shee began. Worthy Ladies, as Philostratus, by calling to memoriethe name of Maso del Saggio, hath contented you with another merryNovell concerning him: In the same manner must I intreat you, toremember once againe Calandrino and his subtle by a pretty talewhich I meane to tell ow, and in what manner they were revenged onhim, for going to seeke the invisible Stone.

　　Needlesse were any fresh relation to you, what manner of peoplethose three men were, Calandrino, Bruno, and Buffalmaco, becausealready you have had sufficient understanding of them. Andtherefore, as an induction to my discourse, I must tell you, thatCalandrino had a small Country-house, in a Village some-what neereto Florence, which came to him by the marriage of his Wife. Amon otherCattle and Poultry, which he kept there in store, hee had a youngBoare readie fatted for Brawne, whereof yearly he used to kill one forhis owne provision; and alwaies in the month of December, he and hiswife resorted to their village house, to have a Brawne both killed andsalted.

　　It came to passe at this time concerning my Tale, that the Womanbeing somewhat crazie and sickly, by her Husbands unkinde usage,whereof you heard so lately; Calandrino went alone to the killing ofhis Boare, which comming to the hearing of Bruno and Buffalmaco andthat the Woman could by no meanes be there: to passe away the time alittle in merriment, they went to a friendlie Companion of theirs,an honest joviall Priest, dwelling not farre off from CalandrinoesCountrey house.

　　The same morning as the Boare was kilde, they all three wentthither, and Calandrino seeing them in the Priests companie: badthem all heartily welcome; and to acquaint them with his goodHusbandry, hee shewed them his house, and the Boare where it hung.They perceyving it to be faire and fat, knowing also, thatCalandrino intended to salt it for his owne store, Bruno saide untohim: Thou art an Asse Calandrino, sell thy Brawne, and let us makemerrie with the money: then let thy wife know no otherwise, but thatit was stolne from thee, by those theeves which continually hauntcountry houses, especially in such scattering Villages.

　　Oh mine honest friends, answered Calandrino, your counsell is not tobe followed, neither is my wife so easie to be perswaded: this wer thereadiest way to make your house a hell, and she to become the MasterDivell: therefore talke no further, for flatly I will not doe it.Albeit they laboured him very earnestly, yet all proved not to aniepurpose: onely he desired them to suppe with him, but in so colde amanner, as they denyed him, and parted thence from him. As they walkedon the way, Bruno saide to Buffalmaco. Shall we three (this night) robhim of his Brawne? Yea marry (quoth Buffalmaco) how is it to bedone? I have (saide Bruno) alreadie found the meanes to effect it,if he take it not from the place where last we saw it. Let us doe itthen (answered Buffalmaco) why should we not do it? Sir Domine heereand we, will make good cheare with it among our selves. The nimblePriest was as forward as the best; and the match being fully agreedon, Bruno thus spake. My delicate Sir Domine, Art and cunning mustbe our maine helps: for thou knowest Buffalmaco, what a covetouswretch Calandrino is, glad and readie to drink alwaies on other mensexpences: let us go take him with us to the Tavern, where the Priest(for his owne honour and reputation) shall offer to make paiment ofthe whole reckoning, without receiving a farthing of his, whereof hewill not be a little joyfull, so shall we bring to passe the rest ofthe businesse, because there is no body in the house, but onelyhimselfe: for he is best at ease without company.

　　As Bruno had propounded, so was it accordingly performed, and whenCalandrino perceyved, that the Priest would suffer none to pay, buthimselfe, he dranke the more freely; and when there was no neede atall, tooke his Cuppes couragiously one after another. Two or threehoures of the night were spent, before they parted from the Taverne,Calandrino going directly home to his house, and instantly to bed,without any other supper, imagining that he had made fast his doore,which (indeede) he left wide open: sleeping soundly, without suspitionof any harme intended unto him. Buffalmaco and Bruno went and suptwith the Priest, and so soone as supper was ended, they tooke certaineEngines, for their better entering into Calandrinoes house, and sowent on to effect theyr purpose. Finding the doore standing readieopen, they entered in, tooke the Brawne, carried it with them to thePriests house, and afterward went all to bed.

　　When Calandrino had well slept after his Wine, he arose in themorning, and being descended downe the staires; finding the streetdoore wide open, he looked for the Brawne, but it was gone.Enquiring of the neighbours dwelling neere about him, hee couldheare no tydings of his Brawne, but became the wofullest man in theworld, telling every one that his Brawne was stolne. Bruno andBuffalmaco being risen in the morning, they went to visiteCalandrino to heare how he tooke the losse of his Brawne: and hee nosooner had a sight of them, but he called them to him; and with theteares running downe his cheekes, sayde: Ah my deare friendes, I amrobde of my Brawne. Bruno stepping closely to him, sayde in hiseare: It is wonderfull, that once in thy life time thou canst beewise. How? answered Calandrino, I speake to you in good earnest.Speake so still in earnest (replied Bruno) and cry it out so loud asthou canst, then let who list beleeve it to be true.

　　Calandrino stampt and fretted exceedingly, saying: As I am a trueman to God, my Prince, and Countrey, I tell thee truly, that my Brawneis stolne. Say so still I bid thee (answered Bruno) and let all theworld beleeve thee, if they list to do so, for I will not. Wouldstthou (quoth Calandrino) have me damne my selfe to the divell? I seethou dost not credit what I say: but would I were hanged by the necke,if it be not true, that my Brawne is stolne. How can it possible be,replyed Bruno? Did not I see it in thy house yesternight? Wouldst thouhave me beleeve, that it is flowne away? Although it is not flowneaway (quoth Calandrino) yet I am certain, that it is stolne away:for which I am weary of my life, because I dare not go home to mineowne house, in regard my wife will never beleeve it; and yet if sheshould credite it, we are sure to have no peace for a twelve monthsspace.

　　Bruno, seeming as if he were more then halfe sorrowfull, yetsupporting still his former jesting humor, saide: Now trust meeCalandrino, if it be so; they that did it are much too blame. If it beso? answered Calandrino, Belike thou wouldst have mee blasphemeHeaven, and all the Saints therein: I tell thee once againe Bruno,that this last night my Brawne was stolne. Be patient good Calandrino,replyed Buffalmaco, and if thy Brawne be stolne from thee, there aremeans enow to get it againe. Meanes enow to get it againe? saidCalandrino, I would faine heare one likely one, and let all the restgo by. I am sure Calandrino, answered Buffalmaco, thou art verilyperswaded, that no Theefe came from India, to steale thy Brawne fromthee: in which respect, it must needes then be some of thy Neighbours:whom if thou couldst lovingly assemble together, I knowe an experimentto be made with Bread and Cheese, whereby the party that hath it, willquickly be discovered.

　　I have heard (quoth Bruno) of such an experiment, and helde it to beinfallible; but it extendeth onely unto persons of Gentilitie, whereofthere are but few dwelling heere about, and in the case of stealinga Brawne, it is doubtfull to invite them, neither can there be anycertainty of their comming. I confesse what you say, aunsweredBuffalmaco, to be very true: but then in this matter, so nerelyconcerning us to be done, and for a deare Friend, what is your advice?I would have Pilles made of Ginger, compounded with your best andstrongest Malmsey, then let the ordinary sort of people be invited(for such onely are most to be mistrusted) and they will not faileto come, because they are utterly ignorant of our intention.Besides, the Pilles may as well bee hallowed and consecrated, as breadand cheese on the like occasion. Indeede you say true (replyedBuffalmaco) but what is the opinion of Calandrino? Is he willing tohave this tryall made, or no? Yes, by all meanes, answered Calandrino,for gladly I would know who hath stolne my Brawne; and your good wordshave (more then halfe) comforted me already in this case.

　　Well then (quoth Bruno) I will take the paines to go to Florence, toprovide all things necessarie for this secret service; but I mustbee furnished with money to effect it. Calandrino had some fortyshillings then about him, which he delivered to Bruno, who presentlywent to Florence, to a frend of his an Apothecarie, of whom hebought a pound of white Ginger, which hee caused him to make uppe insmall Pilles: and two other beside of a Dogges-dates or Dowsets,confected all over with strong Aloes, yet well moulded in Sugare, asall the rest were: and because they should the more easily beeknowne from the other, they were spotted with Gold, in verie formalland Physicall manner. He bought moreover, a big Flaggon of the bestMalmesey, returning backe with all these things to Calandrino, anddirecting him in this order.

　　You must put some friend in trust, to invite your Neighbors(especially such as you suspect) to a breakfast in the morning: andbecause it is done as a feast in kindnesse, they will come to youthe more willingly. This night will I and Buffalmaco take suchorder, that the Pilles shall have the charge imposed on them, and thenwee will bring them hither againe in the morning: and I, my selfe (foryour sake) will deliver them to your guests, and performe whatsoeveris to bee sayde or done. On the next morning, a goodly company beingassembled, under a faire Elme before the Church; as well youngFlorentynes (who purposely came to make themselves merry) asneighbouring Husbandmen of the Village: Bruno was to begin theservice, with the Pils in a faire Cup, and Buffalmaco followed himwith another Cup, to deliver the wine out of the Flaggon, all thecompany beeing set round, as in a circle; and Bruno with Buffalmacobeing in the midst of them, Bruno thus spake.Honest friends, it is fit that I should acquaint you with theoccasion, why we are thus met together, and in this place: becauseif anie thing may seeme offensive to you; afterward you shall makeno complaint of me. From Calandrino (our loving friend heerepresent) yesternight there was a new-kild fat Brawne taken, but whohath done the deede, as yet he knoweth not; and because none other,but some one (or more) heere among us, must needs offend in this case:he, desiring to understand who they be, would have each man to receiveone of these Pilles, and afterward to drinke of this Wine; assuringyou all, that whosoever stole the Brawne hence, cannot be able toswallow the Pill: for it wil be so extreme bitter in his mouth, asit will enforce him to Coughe and spet extraordinarily. In whichrespect, before such a notorious shame be received, and in so goodlyan assembly, as now are heere present: it were much better for himor them that have the Brawne, to confesse it in private to this honestPriest, and I will abstaine from urging anie such publike proofe.

　　Every one there present answered, that they were well contented bothto eate and drinke, and let the shame fall where it deserved;whereupon, Bruno appointing them how they should sit, and placingCalandrino as one among them: he began his counterfeite exorcisme,giving each man a Pill, and Buffalmaco a Cup of Wine after it. Butwhen he came to Calandrino, hee tooke one of them which was made ofthe Dogges dates or Dowsets, and delivering it into his hand,presently hee put it into his mouth and chewed it. So soone as histongue tasted the bitter Aloes, he began to coughe and spet extreamly,as being utterly unable, to endure the bitternesse and noysomesmell. The other men that had receyved the Pils, beganne to gaze oneupon another, to see whose behaviour should discover him; and Brunohaving not (as yet) delivered Pils to them all, proceeded on stillin his businesse, as seeming not to heare any coughing, till onebehinde him, saide. What meaneth Calandrino by this spetting andcoughing?

　　Bruno sodainely turning him about, and seeing Calandrino to coughand spet in such sort, saide to the rest. Be not too rash (honestFriends) in judging of any man, some other matter (then the Pille) mayprocure this Coughing, wherfore he shall receive another, the betterto cleare your beleefe concerning him. He having put the secondprepared Pill into his mouth, while Bruno went to serve the rest ofthe Guests: if the first was exceeding bitter to his taste, this othermade it a great deale worse, for teares streamed forth of his eyesas bigge as Cherry-stones, and champing and chewing the Pill, ashoping it would overcome his coughing; he coughed and spette themore violently, and in grosser manner then he did before, nor did theygive him any wine to helpe it.

　　Buffalmaco, Bruno, and the whole company, perceiving how hecontinued still his coughing and spetting, saide all with one voyce,That Calandrino was the Theefe to him selfe: and gave him manie grossespeeches beside, all departing home unto their houses, very muchdispleased and angry with him. After they were gone, none remainedwith him but the Priest, Bruno and Buffalmaco, who thus spake toCalandrino. I did ever thinke, that thou wast the theefe thy selfe,yet thou imputedst thy robbery to some other, for feare we should oncedrinke freely of thy purse, as thou hast done many times of ours.Calandrino, who had not yet ended his coughing and spetting, swaremany bitter Oathes, that his Brawne was stolne from him. Talke so longas thou wilt, quoth Buffalmaco, thy knavery is both knowne andseene, and well thou mayst be ashamed of thy selfe. Calandrino hearingthis, grew desperately angry; and to incense him more, Bruno thuspursued the matter.

　　Heare me Calandrino, for I speake to thee in honest earnest, therewas a man in the company, who did eate and drinke heere among thyneighbours, and plainly told me, that thou keptst a young Lad heere todo thee service, feeding him with such victuals as thou couldst spare,by him thou didst send away thy Brawne, to one that bought it ofthee for foure Crownes, onely to cousen thy poore wife and us. Canstthou not yet learne to leave thy mocking and scorning? Thou hastforgotte, how thou broughtst us to the plaine of Mugnone, to seeke forblack invisible stones: which having found, thou concealedst them tothy selfe, stealing home invisibly before us, and making us followlike fooles after thee.

　　Now likewise, by horrible lying Oathes, and perjuredprotestations, thou wouldst make us beleeve, that the Brawne (whichthou hast cunningly sold for ready money) was stolne from thee outof thy house, when thou art onely the Theefe to thy selfe, as bythat excellent rule of Art (which never faileth) hath plainly, tothy shame, appeared. Wee being so well acquainted with thydelusions, and knowing them perfectly; now do plainly tell thee,that we mean not to be foold any more. Nor is it unknowne to thee,what paines wee have taken, in making this singular peece of proofe.Wherefore we inflict this punishment on thee, that thou shalt bestowon this honest Priest and us, two couple of Capons, and a Flaggon ofWine, or else we will discover this knavery of thine to thy Wife.

　　Calandrino perceiving, that all his protestations could winne nocredit with them, who had now the Law remaining in their owne hands,and purposed to deale with him as they pleased: apparantly saw, thatsighing and sorrow did nothing availe him. Moreover, to fall intohis wives tempestuous stormes of chiding, would bee worse to himthen racking or torturing: he gladly therefore gave them money, to buythe two couple of Capons and Wine, being heartily contentedlikewise, that hee was so well delivered from them. So the merryPriest, Bruno, and Buffalmaco, having taken good order for salting theBrawne; closely carried it with them to Florence, leaving Calandrinoto complaine of his losse, and well requited, for mocking them withthe invisible stones.

　　A young Gentleman being a Scholler, fell in love with a Ladie, namedHelena, she being a Widdow, and addicted in affection to anotherGentleman. One whole night in cold Winter, she caused the Schollerto expect her comming, in an extreame frost and snow. In revengewhereof, by his imagined Art and skill, he made her to stand nakedon the top of a Tower, the space of a whole day, and in the hot monethof July, to be Sunburnt and bitten with Waspes and Flies.

　　Greatly did the Ladies commend Madame Philomenaes Novell, laughingheartily at poore Calandrino, yet grieving withall, that he shouldbe so knavishly cheated, not onely of his Brawne, but two couple ofCapons, and a Flaggon of Wine beside. But the whole discourse beingended; the Queene commanded Madame Pampinea, to follow next with herNovell, and presently she thus began. It hapneth oftentimes (brightbeauties) that mockery falleth on him, that intended the same untoanother: And there. fore I am of opinion, that there is very litlewisedom declared on him or her, who taketh delight in mocking anyperson. must needs confesse, that we have smiled at many mockeries anddeceits, related in those excellent Novels, which we have alreadyheard: without any due revenge returned, but onely in this last ofsilly Calandrino. Wherefore, it is now my determination, to urge akind of compassionate apprehension, upon a very just retribution,happening to a Gentlewoman of our Citie, because her scorne felldeservedly upon her selfe, remaining mocked, and to the perill ofher life. Let Me then assure you, that your diligent attention mayredound to your benefit, because if you keepe your selves(henceforward) from being scorned by others: you shall expresse thegreater wisedome, and be the better warned by their mishaps.

　　As yet there are not many yeares overpast, since there dwelt inFlorence, a yong Lady, descended of Noble parentage, verybeautifull, of sprightly courage, and sufficiently abounding in thegoods of Fortune, she being named Madame Helena. Her delight was tolive in the estate of Widdowhood, desiring to match her selfe nomore in marriage, because she bare affection to a gallant youngGentleman, whom she had made her private election of, and with whom(having excluded all other amorous cares and cogitations) by meanes ofher Waitingwoman, she had divers meetings, and kinde conferences.

　　It chanced at the verie same time, another young Gentleman of ourCitie, called Reniero, having long studied in the Schooles at Paris,returned home to Florence, not to make sale of his Learning andexperience, as many doe: but to understand the reason of things, asalso the causes and effects of them, which is mervailously fitting forany Gentleman. Being greatly honoured and esteemed of every one, aswell for his courteous carriage towards all in generall, as for hisknowledge and excellent parts: he lived more like a familiarCitizen, then in the nature of a Courtly Gentleman, albeit he waschoisely respected in either estate.

　　But, as oftentimes it commeth to passe, that such as are endued withthe best judgement and understanding in naturall occasions, aresoonest caught and intangled in the snares of Love: so fel it out withour Scholler Reniero, who being invited to a solemne Feast, in companyof other his especiall Friends; this Lady Helena, attyred in herblacke Garments (as Widowes commonly use to wear) was likewise there aGuest. His eye observing her beauty and gracious demeanour, she seemedin his judgement, to be a Woman so compleate and perfect, as he hadnever seene her equall before: and therefore, he accounted the manmore then fortunate, that was worthy to embrace her in his armes.Continuing this amorous observation of her from time to time, andknowing withall, that rare and excellent things are not easilyobtained, but by painefull study, labour, and endeavour: heeresolved with himselfe constantly, to put in practise all his bestparts of industry, onely to honour and please her, and attaining toher contentation, it would be the means to winne her love, andcompasse thereby his hearts desire.

　　The yong Lady, who fixed not her eyes on inferiour subjects (butesteemed her selfe above ordinary reach or capacity) could moovethem artificially, as curious women well know how to doe, looking onevery side about her, yet not in a gadding or grosse manner: forshe was not ignorant in such darting glaunces, as proceeded from anenflamed affection, which appearing plainely in Reniero; with a prettysmile, shee said to her selfe. I am not come hither this day in vaine;for, if my judgement faile me not, I thinke I have caught aWoodcocke by the Bill. And lending him a cunning looke or two,queintly caried with the corner of her eye; she gave him a kinde ofperswading apprehension, that her heart was the guide to her eye.And in this artificial Schoole-tricke of hers, shee carryedtherewith another consideration, to wit, that the more other eyesfedde themselves on her perfections, and were (well-neere) lost inthem beyond recovery: so much the greater reason had he to account hisfortune beyond comparison, that was the sole master of her heart,and had her love at his command.

　　Our witty Scholler having set aside his Philosophicallconsiderations, strove how he might best understand her carriagetoward him, and beleeving that she beheld him with pleasing regards;hee learned to know the house where shee dwelt, passing daily by thedoore divers times, under colour of some more serious occasions:wherein the Lady very proudly gloried, in regard of the reasons beforealleadged, and seemed to affoord him lookes of goode liking. Being ledthus with a hopefull perswasion, bee found the meanes to gaineacquaintance with her waiting-woman, revealing to her his intireaffection, desiring her to worke for him in such sort with her Lady,that his service might be gracious in her acceptance. TheGentlewoman made him a very willing promise, and immediately did hiserrand to her Lady; who heard her with no small pride andsquemishnesse, and breaking forth into a scornefull laughter, thus shespake.

　　Ancilla (for so she was named) dost thou not observe, how thisScholler is come to lose all the wit heere, which he studyed so longfor in the University of Paris? Let us make him our onely Tableargument, and seeing his folly soareth so high, we will feed himwith such a dyet as hee deserveth. Yet when thou speakest next withhim, tell him, that I affect him more then he can doe me; but itbecommeth me to be carefull of mine honour, and to walke with anuntainted brow, as other Ladies and Gentlewomen doe: which he is notto mislike, if he be so wise as he maketh shew of, but rather will themore commend me. Alas good Lady lack-wit, little did she understand(faire assembly) how dangerous a case it is [to] deale with Schollers.

　　At his next meeting with the waiting woman, shee delivered themessage, as her Lady had commanded her, whereof poore Reniero was sojoyfull: that hee pursued his love-suite the more earnestly, and beganto write letters, send gifts, and tokens, all which were stillreceived, yet without any other answere to give hope, but onely ingenerall, and thus shee dallied with him a long while. In the end, shediscovered this matter to her secret chosen friend, who fellsuddenly sicke of the head-ake, onely through meere conceit ofjealousie: which she perceiving, and grieving to be suspectedwithout any cause, especially by him whom shee esteemed above allother; shee intended to rid him quickely of that Idle disease. Andbeing more and more solicited by the Scholler, she sent him word byher maide Ancilla, that (as yet) she could find no convenientopportunity, to yeeld him such assurance, as hee should not any way bedistrustfull of her love.

　　But the Feast of Christmas was now neere at hand, which affordedleisures much more hopefull, then any other formerly passed. Andtherefore, the next night after the first Feasting day, if hepleased to walke in the open Court of her house: she would soonesend for him, into a place much better beseeming, and where they mightfreely converse together.

　　Now was our Scholler the onely jocond man of the world, and failednot the time assigned him, but went unto the Ladies house, whereAncilla was ready to give him entertainment, conducting him into thebase Court, where she lockt him up fast, untill her Lady should sendfor him. This night shee had privately sent for her friend also, andsitting merrily at supper with him, told him, what welcome she hadgiven the Scholler, and how she further meant to use him, saying.Now Sir, consider with your selfe, what hot affection I beare tohim, of whom you became so fondly jealous. The which words were verywelcome to him, and made him extraordinarily joyful; desiring to seethem as effectually performed, as they appeared to him by herprotestations.

　　Heere you are to understand (Gracious Ladies) that according tothe season of the yeare, a great snow had falne the day before, soas the whole Court was covered therewith, and being an extreamefrost upon it, our Scholler could not boast of any warme walking, whenthe teeth quivered in his head with cold, as a Dog could not be morediscourteously used: yet hope of enjoying Loves recompence atlength, made him to support all this injury with admirable patience.

　　Within a while after, Madame Helena said to her friend. Walke withme (deare sal heart) into my Chamber, and there at a secret littlewindow, I shall shew thee what he doth, that drove thee to such asuspition of me, and we shall heare beside, what answere he willgive my maide Ancilla, whom I will send to comfort him in hiscoldnesse.

　　When she had so said, they went to the appointed chamber window,where they could easily see him, but he not them: and then theyheard Ancilla also, calling to him forth of another windowe, saying.Signior Reniero, my Lady is the wofullest woman in the world,because (as yet) she cannot come to you, in regard that one of herbrethren came this evening to visite her, and held her with muchlonger discourse then she expected: whereby she was constrained toinvite him to sup with her, and yet he is not gone; but shortly I hopehee will, and then expect her comming presently; till when, sheentreateth your gentle sufferance.

　　Poore Renicro, our over-credulous Scholler, whose vehement affectionto Madame Helena, so hood-winkt the sight of his understanding, ashe could not be distrustfull of any guilt; returned this answere toAncilla. Say to your Lady that I am bound in duty, to attend thegood houre of her leisure, without so much as the very leastprejudicate conceite in me: Neverthelesse, entreat her, to let itbee so soone as she possibly may, because here is miserable walking,and it beginneth againe to snow extreamely. Ancilla making fast theCasement, went presently to bed; when Helena spake thus to her amorousfriend. What saist thou now? Doest thou thinke that I loved him, asthou wast afraid of? If I did, he should never walke thus in the frostand snow. So, away went they likewise from their close gazingwindow, and spent wanton dalliances together, laughing, and deriding(with many bitter taunts and jests) the lamentable condition ofpoore Reniero.

　　About the Court walked hee numberlesse times, finding such exercisesas he could best devise, to compasse warmth in any manner: no seate orshelter had he any where, either to ease himselfe by sitting downe awhile, or keepe him from the snow, falling continually on him, whichmade him bestow many curses on the Ladies Brother, for his so longtarrying with her, as beleeving him verily to be in the house, or elseshe would (long before) have admitted his entrance, but therein hishope was meerely deceived. It grew now to be about the houre ofmidnight, and Helena had delighted her selfe with her friendextraordinarily, til at last, thus she spake to him. What is thineopinion of my amourous Scholler? Which dost thou imagine to be thegreatest, either his sense and judgement, or the affection I beareto him? Is not this cold sufferance of his, able to quench the violentheat of his loves extremitie, and having so much snow broth to helpeit? Beleeve me (sweet Lady) quoth her friend, as hee is a man, and alearned Scholler, I pitty that he should bee thus ungently dealtwithall: but as he is my rivall and loves enemy, I cannot allow himthe least compassion, resting the more confidently assured of yourlove to me, which I will alwayes esteeme most precious.

　　When they had spent a long while in this or the like conference,with infinite sweet kisses and embraces intermixed; then she beganagaine in this manner. Deare love (quoth she) cast thy Cloake aboutthee, as I intend to doe with my night mantle, and let us step tothe little window once more, to see whether the flaming fire, whichburned in the Schollers brest (as daily avouched to me in his loveletters) be as yet extinct or no. So going to the window againe, andlooking downe into the Court; there they saw the Scholler dancing inthe snow, to the cold tune of his teeths quivering and chattering, andclapping his armes about his body, which was no pleasing melody tohim. How thinkest thou now sweet heart (saide cannot I make a mandaunce without the sound of a Taber, or of a Bagpipe? yes beleeve meLady (quoth he) I plaine pereive you can, and would be very lothe,that at should exercise your cunning on me.

　　Nay, said shee, we will yet delight our selves a little more; let ussoftly descend downe the stayres, even so farre as to the Court doore:thou shalt not speake a word, but I will talke to him, and hearesome part of his quivering language, which cannot choose but beepassing pleasing for us to heare.

　　Out of the Chamber went they, and descended downe the stayres to theCourt doore; where, without opening it, she laide her mouth to a smallcranny, and in a low soft kinde of voyce, called him by his name:which the Scholler hearing, was exceeding joyful, as beleeving verily,that the houre of his deliverance was come, and entrance now should beadmitted him. Upon the hearing of her voyce, hee stept close to thedoore, saying. For charities sake, good Lady, let me come in,because I am almost dead with cold; whereto thus she answered inmocking manner. I make no doubt (my deare friend Reniero) but thenight is indifferent colde, and yet somewhat the warmer by theSnowes falling: and I have heard that such weather as this, istenne-times more extreame at Paris, then heere in our warmer Countrey.And trust me, I am exceeding sorrowfull, that I may not (as yet)open the doore, because mine unhappy brother, who came (unexpected)yester-night to suppe with mee, is not yet gone, as within a shortwhile (I hope) he will, and then shall I gladly set open the dooreto you, for I made an excuse to steale a little from him, onely tocheare you with this small kind of comfort, that his so longtarrying might be the lesse offensive to you.

　　Alas sweet Madame, answered quaking and quivering Reniero, bee thenso favourable to me, as to free me from forth this open Court, wherethere is no shelter or helpe for me, the snow falling still soexceedingly, as a man might easily be more then halfe buried in it:let me but within your doore, and there I will wait your own goodleisure. Alas deare Reniero (answered Helena) I dare not doe it,because the doore maketh such a noyse in the opening, as it will betoo easily heard by my Brother: but I will goe and use such meanes, asshortly hee shall get him gone, and then I dare boldly give youentrance. Doe so good Madame, replyed Reniero, and let there be afaire fire made ready, that when I am within, I may the sooner warmemy selfe; for I am so strangely benummed with colde, as well-neere Iam past all sence of feeling.

　　Can it be possible (quoth Helena) that you should be so benummedwith colde? Then I plainely perceive, that men can lye in their loveletters, which I can shew under your own hand, how you fryed inflames, and all for my love, and so have you written to me in everyletter. Poore credulous women are often thus deluded, in beleevingwhat men write and speake out of passion: but I will returne backeto my Brother, and make no doubt of dispatch, because I would gladlyhave your Company.

　　The amourous Friend to Helena, who stood by all this while, laughingat the Schollers hard usage, returned up againe with her to herChamber, where they could not take a jote of rest, for flouting andscorning the betrayed Scholler, As for him poore man, hee was becomelike the Swanne, coldly chattering his teeth together, in a strangenew kinde of harmony to him. And perceiving himselfe to be meerelymocked, he attempted to get open the doore, or how he might passeforth at any other place; but being no way able to compasse it, hewalked up and downe like an angry Lyon, cursing the hard quality ofthe time, the discourtesie of the Lady, the over-tedious length of thenight; but (most of all) his owne folly and simplicity, in being sobasely abused and gulde. Now began the heat of his former affection toHelena, altered into as violent a detestation of her; Yea, extremityof hatred in the highest degree; beating his braines, and ransackingevery corner of in. vention, by what meanes he might best berevenged on her, which now he more earnestly desired to effect, thento enjoy the benefit of her love, or to be embraced betweene herarmes.

　　After that the sad and discomfortable night had spent it selfe,and the break of day was beginning to appeare; Ancilla thewaiting-woman, according as she was instructed by her Lady, went downeand opened the Court doore, and seeming exceedingly to compassionatethe Schollers unfortunate night of sufferance, saide unto him.

　　Alas courteous Gentleman, in an unblessed houre came my Ladyesbrother hither yesternight, inflicting too much trouble upon us, and agrievous time of affliction to you. But I am not ignorant, that youbeing vertuous, and a judicious Scholler, have an invincible spirit ofpacience, and sufficient understanding withall; that what this nightcould not affoord, another may make a sound amends for. This I can anddare sufficiently assure you, that nothing could be more displeasingto my Lady, neither can she well be quieted in her mind: untill shehave made a double and treble requitall, for such a strange unexpectedinconvenience, whereof she had not the very least suspition.

　　Reniero swelling with discontentment, yet wisely clouding it fromopen apprehension, and knowing well enough, that such goldenspeeches and promises, did alwaies savour of what intemperatespleene would more lavishly have vented foorth, and therefore in amodest dissembling manner; without the least shew of any anger, thushe answered.

　　In good sadnesse Ancilla, I have endured the most miserablestnight of cold, frost and snow, that ever any poore Gentleman suffered;but I know well enough, your Lady was not in any fault thereof,neither meriteth to be blamed, for in her owne person (as being truelycompassionate of my distresse) she came so farre as the doore ofthis Court, to excuse her selfe, and comfort mee. But as you saide,and very well too, what hath failed this night, another hereaftermay more fortunately performe: in hope whereof, commend my love andduteous service to her, and (what else remaineth mine) to yourgentle selfe.

　　So our halfe frozen Scholler, scarcely able to walke upon hislegges, returned home, (so well as hee could) to his owne lodging;where, his spirits being grievously out of order, and his eyes staringgastly through lacke of sleepe: he lay downe on h bed, and after alittle rest, he found himselfe in much worse condition then before, asmeerely taken lame in his armes and his legges. Whereupon he wasinforced to send for Phisitions, to be advised by their councell, insuch an extremity of cold received. Immediately, they made provisionfor his healthes remedie (albeit his nerves and sinewes could veryhardly extend themselves) yet in regard he was yong, and Summerswiftly drawing on; they had the better hope of affecting his safty,out of so great and dangerous a cold.

　　But after he was become almost well and lusty againe, hee used to beseldome seene abroad for an indifferent while; concealing his intendedrevenge secret to himselfe, yet appearing more affectionate toMadame Helena, then formerly he had beene.

　　Now, it came to passe (within no long while after) that Fortunebeing favourable to our injured Scholler, prepared a new accident,wherby he might fully effect his harts desire. For the lusty yongGallant, who was Madame Helenaes deare darling and delight, and (forwhose sake) she dealt so inhumanely with poore Reniero: became wearyof her amourous service, and was falne in liking of another Lady,scorning and disdaining his former Mistresse; whereat shee grewexceedingly displeased, and began to languish in sighes and teares.

　　But Ancilla her waiting-woman, compassionating the perilouscondition of her Lady, and knowing no likely meanes whereby to conquerthis oppressing melancholly, which shee suffered for the losse ofher hearts chosen friend: at length she began to consider, that theScholler still walked daily by the doore, as formerly hee was wontto doe, and (by him) there might some good be done.

　　A fond and foolish opinion overswayed her, that the Scholler wasextraordinarily skilfull in the Art of Nigromancy, and could therebyso over-rule the heart of her lost friend, as hee should bee compelledto love her againe, in as effectuall manner as before; herewithimmediately she acquainted her Lady, who being as rashly credulous, asher maide was opinionative (never considring, that if the Scholler hadany experience in Negromancy, hee would thereby have procured his ownesuccesse) gave releefe to her surmise, in very joviall and comfortablemanner, and entreated her in all kindnes, to know of him, whether hecould worke such a businesse, or no, and (upon his undertaking toeffect it) shee would give absolute assurance, that (in recompencethereof) he should unfainedly obtaine his hearts desire. Ancilla wasquicke and expeditious, in delivering this message to discontentedReniero, whose soule being ready to mount out of his body, onely byconceit of joy; chearefully thus he said within himselfe. GraciousFortune! how highly am I obliged to thee for this so great favour? Nowthou hast blest me with a happy time, to be justly revenged on sowicked a woman, who sought the utter ruine of my life, in recompenceof the unfaigned affection I bare her. Returne to thy Lady (quothhe) and saluting her first on my behalfe, bid her to abandon allcare in this businesse; for, if her amourous Friend were in India, Iwould make him come (in meere despight of his heart) and crave mercyof her for his base transgression. But concerning the meanes how,and in what manner it is to bee done, especially on her ownebehalfe: I will impart it to her so soone as she pleaseth: faile notto tell her so constantly from me, with all my utmost paines at herservice.

　　Ancilla came jocondly home with her answere, and a conclusion wasset downe for their meeting together at Santa Lucia del prato, whichaccordingly was performed, in very solemne conference between them.Her fond affection had such power over her, that shee had forgot, intowhat peril she brought his life, by such an unnatural nightwalke:but disclosed all her other intention to him, how loth she was to loseso deare a friend, and desiring him to exercise his utmost height ofskil, with large promises of her manifold favours to him, wheretoour Scholler thus replyed.

　　Very true it is Madam, that among other studies at Paris, Ilearned the Art of Negromancy, the depth whereof I am as skilfullin, as anie other Scholler whatsoever. But, because it is greatlydispleasing unto God, I made a vow never to use it, either for myselfe, or anie other. Neverthelesse, the love I beare you is of suchpower, as I know not well how to denie, whatsoever you please tocommand me: in which respect, if in doing you my very best service,I were sure to bee seized on by all the divels: I will not faile toaccomplish your desire, you onely having the power to command me.But let me tell you Madame, it is a matter not so easie to beperformed, as you perhaps may rashly imagine, especially, when a Womanwould repeale a man to love her, or a man a woman: because, it isnot to be done, but by the person whom it properly concerneth. Andtherefore it behoveth, that such as would have this businesseeffected, must be of a constant minde, without the least scruple offeare: because it is to be accomplished in the darke night season,in which difficulties I doe not know, how you are able to warrant yourselfe, or whether you have such courage of spirit, as (with boldnes)to adventure.

　　Madame Helena, more hot in pursuite of her amorous contentment, thenany way governed by temperate discretion, presently thus answered.Sir, Love hath set such a keene edge on my unconquerable affection, asthere is not any daunger so difficult, but I dare resolutely undertakeit, for the recovery of him, who hath so shamefullie refused mykindnesse: wherefore (if you please) shew mee, wherein I must be soconstant and dreadlesse. The Scholler, who had (more then halfe)caught a right Ninnyhammer by the beake, thus replyed. Madame, ofnecessity I must make an image of Tin, in the name of him whom youdesire to recall. Which when I have sent you, the Moone being thenin her full, and your selfe stript starke naked: immediately afteryour first sleepe, seaven times you must bathe your selfe with it in aswift running River. Afterward, naked as you are, you must climbe upupon some tree, or else upon an uninhabited house top, wherestanding dreadlesse of any perill, and turning your face to the North,with the Image in your hand, seaven times you must speake such wordes,as I will deliver to you in writing.

　　After you have so often spoken them, two goodly Ladies (the veryfairest that ever you beheld) wil appeare unto you, very graciouslysaluting you, and demanding what you would have them to performe foryou. Safely you may speake unto them, and orderly tel them what youdesire: but be very careful, that you name not one man insted ofanother. When you have uttered your mind, they wil depart from you,and then you may descend againe, to the place where you did leave yourgarments, which having putte on, then returne to your house. Andundoubtedly, before the midst of the next night following, your friendwil come in teares to you, and humbly crave your pardon on hisknees; beeing never able afterward to be false to you, or leave yourLove for any other whatsoever.

　　The Lady hearing these words, gave very setled beleefe to them,imagining unfainedly, that shee had (more then halfe) recovered herfriend already, and held him embraced between her armes: in whichjocond perswasion, the chearful blood mounted up into hir cheekes, andthus she replyed.

　　Never make you any doubt Sir, but that I can sufficiently performewhatsoever you have said, and am provided of the onely place in theworld, where such a weighty businesse is to be effected. For I havea Farme or dairy house, neere adjoyning to the vale of Arno, andclosely bordering upon the same River. It beeing now the moneth ofjuly, the most convenientest time of all the yeare to bathe in; Ican bee the easier induced thereunto.

　　Moreover, there is hard by the Rivers side a smal Tower or Turretuninhabited; whereinto few people do sildome enter, but onelyHeardsmen or Flocke-keepers, who ascend uppe (by the helpe of a woddenLadder) to a Tarrasse on the top of the saide Tower, to looke allabout for their beasts, when they are wandred astray: it standing in asolitary place, and out of the common way or resort. There dare Iboldly adventure to mount up, and with the invincible courage of awronged Lady (not fearing to looke death himself in the face) do althat you have prescribed, yea, and much more, to recover my deare lostLover againe, whom I value equal with my owne Life.

　　Reniero, who perfectly knew both the Dairy Farme, and the old smalTurret, not a little joyful, to heare how forward shee was to shameher selfe, answered in this manner. Madame, I was never in those partsof the Country, albeit they are so neere to our City, and therfore Imust needs be ignorant, not onely of your Farme, but the Turretalso. But if they stand in such convenient manner as you havedescribed, all the world could not yeelde the like elsewhere, so aptand sutable to your purpose: wherefore, with such expedition aspossibly can use, I will make the Image, and send it you, as alsothe charme, verie fairely written. But let me entreate you, thatwhen you have obtayned your hearts desire, and are able to Judgetruely of my love and service: not to be unmindfull of me, but (atyour best leysure) to performe what you have with such protestationspromised; which shee gave him her hand and faith to do, without anyimpeach or hinderance: and so parting, she returned home to her house.

　　Our over-joyed Scholler, applauding his happy Starres, forfurthering him with faire a way to his revenge; immagining that it wasalready halfe executed, made the Image in due forme, and wrote anold Fable, insted of a Charme; both which he sent to the Lady, sosoone as he thought the time to be fitting: and this admonitionwithall, that the Moone being entering into the full, without anylonger delay, she might venter on the businesse the next nightfollowing; and remaine assured to repossesse her friend. Afterward forthe better pleasing of himselfe, he went secretly attended, onely byhis servant, to the house of a trusty frend of his, who dweltsomwhat neere to the Turret, there to expect the issue of thisLady-like enterprize. And Madam Helena accompanied with none butAncilla walked on to her dairy Farme, where the night ensuing,pretending to take her rest sooner then formerly she used to doe,she commanded Ancilla to bed, referring her selfe to her best liking.

　　After she had to her first sleepe (according to the Schollersdirection) departing softly out of her chamber, she went on towardsthe ancient Tower, standing hard by the river of Arno, looking everyway heedfully about hir, least she should be spied by any person.But perceiving hir selfe to be so secure as she could desire;putting off all her garments, she hid them in a small brake of bushes:afterward, holding the Image in hir hand, seven times she bathd hirbody in the river, and then returned with it to the Tower. TheScholler, who at the nights closing up of day, had hid himselfeamong the willowes and other trees, which grew very thick about theTower, saw both hir going and returning from the River, and as shepassed thus naked by him, he plainly perceyved, that the nightsobscurity could not cloud the delicate whitenes of hir body, butmade the Starres themselves to gaze amorously on her, even as ifthey were proud to behold her bathing, and (like so many twinklingTapers) shewed hir in emulation of another Diana. Now, whatconflicts this sight caused in the mind of our Scholler, one while,quenching his hatefull spleen towards hir, al coveting to imbrace apiece of such perfection: another while, thinking it a purchase fitfor one of Cupids soldiers, to seize and surprize hir uppon so fairean advantage, none being to yeild her rescue: in the fiery triall ofsuch temptations, I am not able to Judge, or to say, what resistanceflesh and blood could make, being opposed with such a sweet enemy.

　　But he well considering what she was, the greatnes of his injury, asalso how, and for whom: he forgot all wanton allurements of Love,scorning to entertaine a thought of compassion, continuing constant inhis resolution, to let her suffer, as he himselfe had done. So, Helenabeing mounted up on the Turret, and turning her face towards theNorth; she repeated those idle frivolous words (composed in the natureof a charme) which shee had received from the Scholler. Afterward,by soft and stealing steps, hee went into the old Tower, and tookeaway the Ladder, whereby she ascended to the Tarras, staying andlistening, how shee proceeded in her amorous exorcisme.

　　Seven times she rehearsed the charme to the Image, looking stillwhen the two Ladies would appeare in their likenesse, and so longshe held on her imprecations (feeling greater cold, then willinglieshe would have done) that breake of day began to shew it selfe, andhalfe despairing of the Ladies comming, according as the Schollerbad promised, she said to her selfe: I much misdoubt, that Renierohath quitted me with such another peece of night-service, as it was mylucke to bestow on him: but if he have done it in that respect, heewas but ill advised in his revenge, because the night wants nowthree parts of the length, as then it had: and the cold which hesuffered, was far superior in quality to mine, albeit it is more sharpnow in the morning, then all the time of night it hath bin.

　　And, because day-light should not discover her on the Tarrasse,she went to make her descent downe againe: but finding the Ladder tobe taken away, and thinking how her publike shame was nowinevitable, her heart dismayed, and shee fell downe in a swoune on theTarras: yet recovering her senses afterward, her greefe and sorrow ex.ceeded all capacity of utterance. For, now she became fully perswaded,that this proceeded from the Schollers malice, repenting for herunkinde usage towards him, but much more condemning her selfe, forreposing any trust in him, who stood bound (by good reason) to beher enemy.

　　Continuing long in this extreame affliction, and surveighing alllikely meanes about her, whereby she might descend from the Tarras,whereof she was wholly disappointed: she began to sighe and weepeexceedingly, and in this heavy perplexity of spirit, thus sheecomplained to her selfe. Miserable and unfortunate Helena, what willbe saide by thy Bretheren, Kindred, Neighbours, and generalliethroughout all Florence, when they shall know, that thou wast foundeheere on this Turret, starke naked? Thine honourable carriage, andhonesty of life, heeretofore free from a thought of suspition, shallnow be branded with detestation; and if thou wouldst cloud thismishappe of thine, by such lies and excuses, as are not rare amongstwomen: yet Reniero that wicked Scholler, who knoweth all thy privycompacting, will stand as a thousand witnesses against thee, and shamethee before the whole City, so both thine honor and loved friend arelost for ever.

　　Having thus consulted with her selfe, many desperate motionsentred her minde, to throw her selfe headlong from off the Tarras;till better thoughts wone possession of her soule. And the Sunne beingrisen, shee went to every corner of the Tarras, to espye any Ladcome abroad with his beasts, by whom she might send for herwaitingwoman. About this instant, the Scholler who lay sleeping (allthis while) under a bush, suddenly awaking; saw her looke over thewall, and she likewise espyed him; whereupon hee said unto her. Goodmorrow Madame Helena, What? are the Ladies come yet or no? Helenabearing his scorning question, and grieving that hee should sodelude her: in teares and lamentations, she intreated him to comeneere the Tower, because she desired to speake with him. Whichcourtesie he did not deny her, and she lying groveling upon herbrest on the Tarras, to hide her body that no part thereof might beseene, but her head; weeping, she spake thus to him.

　　Reniero, upon my credit, if I gave thee an ill nights rest, thouhast well revenged that wrong on me; for, although wee are now inthe moneth of july, I have beene plagued with extremity of colde (inregard of my nakednesse) even almost frozen to death: beside mycontinuall teares and lamenting, that folly perswaded me to beleevethy protestations, wherein I account it well-neere miraculous, thatmine eyes should be capable of any sight. And therefore I pray thee,lot in respect of any love which thou canst pretend to beare me; butfor regard of thine owne selfe, being a Gentleman and a Scholler, thatthis punishment which thou hast already inflicted upon me, may sufficefor or my former injuries towards thee, and to hold selfe revengedfully, as also permit my garments to be brought me, that I may descendfrom hence, without taking th it from me, which afterward (althoughthou wouldst) thou canst never restore me, I meane mine honour. Andconsider with thy selfe, that albeit thou didst not injoy my companythat unhappy night, yet thou hast power to command me at any timewhen soever, with making many diversities of amends, for one nightsoffence only committed. Content thy selfe then good Reniero, and asthou art an honest gentleman, say thou art sufficiently revenged onme, in making me dearely confesse mine owne errour.

　　Never exercise thy malice upon a poore weake woman, for the Eagledisdaineth to pray on the yeelding Dove: and therefore in meere pitty,and for manhoods sake, be my release from open shame and reproch.

　　The Scholler, whose envious spleene was swolne very great, inremembring such a malicious cruelty exercised on him, beholding toweepe and make such lamentations; found a fierce conflict in histhoughts, betweene content and pitty. It did not a little joy andcontent him, that the revenge which he so earnestly desired tocompasse, was now by him so effectually inflicted. And yet (in meerehumanity) pitty provoked him, to commisserate the Ladies distressedcondition: but clemency being over-weake to withstand his rigor,thus he replied. Madam Helena, if mine entreaties (which, to speaketruly, I never knew how to steepe in tears, nor wrap up my words insugar Candie, so cuningly as you women know how to do) could haveprevailed, that miserable night, when I was well-neere frozen to deathwith cold, and meerly buried with snow in your Court, not havinganie place of rescue or shelter; your complaints would now the moreeasily over-rule me. But if your honor in estimation, bee now moreprecious to you then heretofore, and it seemeth so offensive tostand there naked: convert your perswasions and prayers to him, inwhose armes you were that night imbraced, both of your triumphing inmy misery, when poor I, trotted about your Court, with the teethquivering in my head, and beating mine armes about my body, finding nocompassion in him, or you. Let him bring thee thy Garments, let himcome helpe thee down with the Ladder, and let him have the care ofthine honour, on whom thou hast bene so prodigall heretofore inbestowing it, and now hast unwomanly throwne thy selfe in perill,onely for the maintenance of thine immodest desires.

　　Why dost thou not call on him to come helpe thee? To whom doeth itmore belong, then to him? For thou art his and he thine. Why thenshold any other but he help thee in this distresse? Call him (foole asthou art) and try, if the love he beareth thee, and thy bestunderstanding joyned with his, can deliver thee out of my sottishdetaining thee. I have not forgot, that when you both made a pastimeof my misery, thou didst demand of him, which seemed greatest in hisopinion, either my sottish simplicity, or the love thou barest him.I am not now so liberall or courteous, to desire that of thee, whichthou wouldst not grant, if I did request it: No, no, reserve thosenight favours for thy amorous friend, if thou dost escape hencealive to see him againe. As for my selfe, I leave thee freely to hisuse and service: because I have sufficiently payde for a womansfalshood, and wisemen take such warning, that they scorne to bee twicedeceived, and by one woman. Proceed on stil in thy flatteringperswasions, terming me to be a Gentleman and a Scholler, thereby towin such favor from me, that I should think thy villany toward me,to be already sufficiently punished. No, treacherous Helena, thyblandishments cannot now hoodwink the eies of my understanding, aswhen thou didst out-reach me with thy disloyall promises andprotestations. And let me now tell thee plainely, that all the while Icontinued in the Universitie of Paris, I never attained unto soperfect an understanding of my selfe, as in that one miserable nightthou diddest enstruct mee. But admit, that I were enclined unto amercifull and compassionate minde, yet thou art none of them, on whomemilde and gracious mercy should any way declare her effects. For,the end of pennance among savage beasts, such as thou art, andlikewise of due vengeance, ought to be death: whereas among men, itshould suffice according to thine owne saying. Wherefore, in regardthat I am neither an Eagle, nor thou a Dove, but rather a mostvenomous Serpent: I purpose with my utmost hatred, and as an ancientenemy to all such as thou art, to make my revenge famous on thee.

　　I am not ignorant, that whatsoever I have already done unto thee,cannot properly be termed revenge, but rather chastisement; becauserevenge ought alwayes to exceede the offence, which (as yet) I amfarre enough from. For, if I did intend to revenge my wrongs, andremembred thy monstrous cruelty to me: thy life, if I tooke it fromthee, and an hundred more such as thy selfe, were farreinsufficient, because in killing thee, I should kill but a vileinhumane beast, yea, one that deserved not the name of a Woman. And,to speake truely, Art thou any more, or better (setting aside thyborrowed haire, and painted beauty, which in few yeares will leavethee wrinkled and deformed) then the basest beggarly Chamber-stuffethat can bee? Yet thou soughtest the death of a Gentleman and Scholleras (in scorne) not long since, thou didst terme me: whose life mayhereafter be more beneficiall unto the world, then millions of such asthou art, to live in the like multiplicity of ages. Therefore, if thisanguish be sensible to thee, learne what it is to mocke men ofapprehension, and (amongst them especially) such as are Schollers:to prevent thy falling hereafter into the like extremity, if it be thygood lucke to escape out of this.

　　It appeareth to me, that thou art verie desirous to come downehither on the ground; the best counsell that I can give thee, is toleape downe headlong, that by breaking thy necke (if thy fortune be sofaire) thy life and lothsome qualities ending together, I may sitand smile at thy deserved destruction. I have no other comfort to givethee, but only to boast my happinesse, in teaching thee the way toascend that Tower, and in thy descending downe (even by what means thywit can best devise) make a mockery of me, and say thou hast learnedmore, then all my Schollership could instruct thee.

　　All the while as Reniero uttered these speeches, the miserableLady sighed and wept very grievously, the time running on, and theSunne ascending higher and higher; but when she heard him silent, thusshe answered. Unkinde and cruell man, if that wretched night was sogreevous to thee, and mine offence appeared so great, as neither myyouth, beautie, teares, and humble intercessions, are able to deriveany mercy from thee; yet let the last consideration moove thee to someremorse: namely that I reposed new confidence in thee (when I hadlittle or no reason at all to trust thee) and discovered theintegritie of my soule unto thee, whereby thou didst compasse themeanes, to punish me thus deservedly for my sinne. For, if I had notreposed confidence in thee, thou couldst not (in this maner) havewrought revenge on me, which although thou didst earnestly covet,yet my rash credulitie was thy onely helpe. Asswage then thineanger, and graciously pardon me, wherein if thou wilt be somercifull to me, and free me from this fatall Tower: I do heerefaithfully promise thee, to forsake my most false and disloyallfriend, electing thee as my Lord and constant Love for ever.

　　Moreover, although thou condemnest my beauty greatly, esteeming itas a trifle, momentary, and of slender continuance; yet, such as it is(being comparable with any other womans whatsoever) I am not soignorant, that were there no other reason to induce liking thereof:yet men in the vigour of their youth (as I am sure you think yourselfe not aged) do hold it for an especiall delight, ordained bynature for them to admire and honour. And notwithstanding all thycruelty extended to mee, yet I cannot be perswaded, that thou art soflinty or Ironhearted, as to desire my miserable death, by castingmy selfe headlong downe (like a desperate madde woman) before thyface, so to destroy that beuty, which (if thy Letters lyed not) wasonce so highly pleasing in thine eyes. Take pitty then on mee forcharities sake, because the Sunne beginneth to heate extreamely: andas over-much colde (that unhappy night) was mine offence, so let notover-violent warmth be now my utter ruine and death.

　　The Scholler, who (onely to delight himselfe) maintained this longdiscoursing with her, returned her this answere. Madame, you did notrepose such confidence in me, for any good will or afrection in youtowards me, but in hope of recovering him whom you had lost; whereinyou merit not a jot of favour, but rather the more sharpe and severeinfliction. And whereas you inferre, that your over-rash credulity,gave the onely meanes to my revenge: Alas! therein you deceive yourselfe; for I have a thousand crochets working continually in my brain,whereby to entrap a wiser creature then a woman, yet veiled allunder the cunning cloake of love, but sauced with the bitter Wormewoodof hate. So that, had not this hapned as now it doth, of necessity youmust have falne into another: but, as it hath pleased my happy starsto favour mee therein, none could proove more to your eternallscandall and disgrace, then this of your owne devising; which I madechoise of, not in regard of any ease to you, but onely to content myselfe.

　　But if all other devises els had failed, my pen was and is myprevayling Champion, where-with I would have written such and somany strange matters, concerning you in your very dearestreputation; that you should have curst the houre of your conception,and wisht your birth had bin abortive. The powers of the pen are toomany and mighty, wherof such weake wits as have made no experience,are the lesse able to use any relation. I sweare to you Lady, by mybest hopes, that this revenge which (perhappes) you esteeme greatand dishonourable, is no way compareable to the wounding Lines of aPenne, which can carracter downe so infinite infamies (yet none butguilty and true taxations) as will make your owne hands immediateinstruments, to teare the eyes from forth your head, and so bequeathyour after dayes unto perpetuall darkenesse.

　　Now, concerning your lost lover, for whose sake you suffer thisunexpected pennance; although your choise hath proved but bad, yetstill continue your affection to him: in regard that I have anotherLadie and Mistresse, of higher and greater desert then you, and towhome I will continue for ever constant. And whereas you thinke, thewarme beames of the Sunne, will be too hot and scorching for your nicebodie to endure: remember the extreame cold which you caused mee tofeele, and if you can intermixe some part of that cold with thepresent heat, I dare assure you, the Sun (in his highest heate) willbe far more temperate for your feeling.

　　The disconsolate Lady perceiving, that the Schollers wordes savouredof no mercy, but rather as coveting her desperate ending; with theteares streaming downe her cheekes, thus she replied. Wel Sir,seeing there is no matter of worth in me, whereby to derive anycompassion from you: yet for that Ladies sake, whom you have electedworthy to enjoy your love, and so farre excelleth mee in Wisedome;vouchsafe to pardon mee, and suffer my garments to be brought me,wherewith to cover my nakednesse, and so to descend downe from thisTower, if it may stand with your gentle Nature to admit it.

　　Now beganne Reniero to laughe very heartily, and perceiving howswiftly the day ran on in his course, he saide unto her. Beleeve meMadame Helena, you have so conjured me by mine endeered Ladie andMistresse, that I am no longer able to deny you; wherefore, tell mewhere your garments are, and I will bring them to you, that you maycome downe from the Turret. She beleeving his promise, tolde him whereshe had hid them, and Reniero departing from the Tower, commandedhis servant, not to stirre thence: but to abide still so neere it,as none might get entrance there till his returning. Which chargewas no sooner given to his man, but hee went to the house of a neereneighboring friend, where he dined well, and afterward laid himdowne to sleepe.

　　In the meane while, Madame Helena remaining still on the Tower,began to comfort her selfe with a little vaine hope, yet sighing andweeping incessantly, seating her selfe so well as shee could, whereany small shelter might yeelde the least shade, in expectation ofthe Schollers returning: one while weeping, then againe hoping, butmost of all despairing, by his so long tarrying away with herGarments; so that beeing over-wearied with anguish and longwatching, she fell into a little slumbering. But the Sunne was soextreamly hot, the houre of noone being already past, that it meerlyparched her delicate body, and burnt her bare head so violently: asnot onely it seared all the flesh it touched; but also cleft andchinkt it strangely, beside blisters and other painfull scorchingsin the flesh which hindred her sleeping, to help her self (by allpossible means) waking. And the Turret being covered with Lead, gavethe greater addition to her torment; for, as she removed from oneplace to another, it yeelded no mitigation to the burning heate, butparched and wrinkled the flesh extraordinarily, even as when a pieceof parchment is throwne into the fire, and recovered out againe, cannever be extended to his former forme.

　　Moreover, she was so grievously payned with the head-ake, as itseemed to split in a thousand pieces, whereat there needed no greatthe Lead of the Turret being so exceedingly hot, that it affoorded notthe least defence against it, or any repose to qualifie the torment:but drove her still from one place to another, in hope of ease, butnone was there to be found.

　　Nor was there any winde at all stirring, whereby to asswage theSunnes violent scalding, or keepe away huge swarmes of Waspes,Hornets, and terrible byting Flyes, which vexed her extreamely,feeding on those parts of her body, that were rifte and chinkt, likecrannies in a mortered wall, and pained her like so many points ofpricking Needles, labouring still with her hands to beate them away,but yet they fastned on one place or other, and afflicted her ingrievous manner, causing her to curse her owne life, hir amorousfriend, but (most of all) the Scholler, that promised to bring herGarments, and as yet returned not. Now began she to gaze upon everyside about her, to espy some labouring Husbandmen in the fields, towhom she might call or cry out for helpe, not fearing to discoverher desperate condition: but Fortune therein also was adverse toher, because the heats extreamity, had driven all the village out ofthe fields, causing them to feede their Cattle about theyr ownehouses, or in remote and shadie Valleyes: so that shee could see noother creatures to comfort her, but Swannes swimming in the River ofArno, and wishing her selfe there a thousand times with them, for tocoole the extreamity of her thirst, which so much the moreencreased, onely by the sight thereof, and utterly disabled ofhaving any.

　　She saw beside in many places about her, goodly Woods, fayre cooleshades, and Country houses here and there dispersed; which added thegreater violence to hir affliction, that her desires (in all these)could no way be accomplished. What shall I say more concerning thisdisastrous Lady? The parching beames of the Sunne above her, thescalding heat of the Lead beneath her, the Hornets and Flyes everieway stinging her, had made such an alteration of her beautifull bodie:that, as it checkt and controlled the precedent nights darkenesse,it was now so metamorphosed with rednesse, yea, and blood issuingforth in infinite places, as she seemed (almost) loathsome to lookeon, continuing still in this agonie of torment, quite voyde of allhope, and rather expecting death, then any other comfort.

　　Reniero, when some three houres of the afternoone were overpast,awaked from sleeping: and remembring Madame Helena, he went to seein what estate she was; as also to send his servant unto dinner,because he had fasted all that day. She perceyving his arrivall, beingaltogether weake, faint, and wonderously over-wearied, she crept onher knees to a corner of the Turret, and calling to him, spake in thismanner. Reniero, thy revenge exceedeth al manhoode and respect: For,if thou wast almost frozen in my Court, thou hast roasted me all daylong on this Tower, yea, meerly broyled my poore naked bodie, besidestarving mee thorough want of Food and drinke. Be now then somercifull (for manhoods sake) as to come uppe hither, and inflict thaton me, which mine owne hands are not strong enough to do, I meanethe ending of my loathed and wearisome life, for I desire it beyondall comfort else, and I shall honour thee in the performance of it. Ifthou deny me this gracious favour; at least send me uppe a glasse ofWater, onely to moisten my mouth, which my teares (being all meerlydried up) are not able to doe, so extreame is the violence of theSunnes burning heate.

　　Well perceived the Scholler, by the weaknesse of her voyce, andscorching of her body by the Suns parching beames, that shee wasbrought now to great extremity: which sight, as also her humbleintercession, began to touch him with some compassion, nevertheles,thus he replied. Wicked woman, my hands shal be no means of thy death,but make use of thine owne, if thou be so desirous to have it: andas much water shalt thou get of me to asswage thy thirst, as thougavest me fire to comfort my freezing, when thou wast in the luxuriousheat of thy immodest desires, and I wel-neere frozen to death withextremity of cold. Pray that the Evening may raine downe Rosewateron thee, because that in the River of Arno is not good enough forthee: for as little pitty doe I take on thee now, as thou didst extendcompassion to me then.

　　Miserable Woman that I am, answered Helena; Why did the heavensbestow beautie on mee, which others have admired and honoured, and yet(by thee) is utterly despised? More cruell art thou then any savageBeast; thus to vexe and torment mee in such mercilesse manner. Whatgreater extreamity couldst thou inflict on me, if I had bin thedestruction of all thy Kindred, and lefte no one man living of thyrace? I am verily perswaded, that more cruelty cannot be usedagainst a Traitor, who was the subversion of an whole Cittie, thenthis tyranny of thine, roasting me thus in the beames of the Sun,and suffering my body to be devoured with Flies, without so small amercie, as to give mee a little coole water, which murtherers arepermitted to have, being condemned by justice, and led to execution:yea Wine also, if they request it.

　　But, seeing thou art so constant in thy pernitious resolve, asneither thine owne good Nature, nor this lamentable sufferance inme, are able to alter thee: I will prepare my self for deathpatiently, to the end, that Heaven may be mercifull to my soul, andreward thee justly, according to thy cruelty. Which words being ended,she withdrew her selfe towards the middest of the Tarras, despairingof escaping (with life)

　　from the heates violence; and not once onely, but infinite timesbeside (among her other grievous extreamities) she was ready to dyewith drought, bemoaning incessantly her dolorous condition.

　　By this time the day was well neere spent, and night beganne tohasten on apace: when the Scholler (immagining that he afflicted hersufficiently) tooke her Garments, and wrapping them up in his mansCloake, went thence to the Ladies house, where he found Ancilla theWaiting-woman sitting at the doore, sad and disconsolate for herLadies long absence, to whom thus he spake. How now Ancilla? Whereis thy Lady and Mistris? Alas Sir (quoth she) I know not. I thoughtthis morning to have found her in her bed, as usually I was wont todo, and where I left her yesternight at our parting: but there she wasnot, nor in any place else of my knowledge, neyther can I imagine whatis become of her, which is to me no meane discomfort.

　　But can you (Sir) say any thing of her? Ancilla, said he, I wouldthou hadst bin in her company, and at the same place where now she is,that some punishment for thy fault might have falne uppon thee, asalready it hath done on her. But beleeve it assuredly, that thou shaltnot freely escape from my fingers, till I have justly paide thee forthy paines, to teach thee to abuse any Gentleman, as thou didst me.

　　Having thus spoken, hee called to his servant, saying. Give herthe Garments, and bid her go looke her Lady, if she will. TheServingman fulfilled his Masters command, and Ancilla havingreceyved her Ladies cloaths, knowing them perfectly, and remembring(withall) what had bin said: she waxed very doubtfull, least theyhad slaine her, hardly refraining from exclaiming on them, but thatgreefe and heavie weeping overcame her; so that uppon the Schollersdeparting, she ranne in all hast with the garments towardes the Tower.

　　Upon this fatall and unfortunate day to Madame Helena, it chanced,that a Clowne or Countrey Peazant belonging to her Farme or Dairyhouse, having two of his young Heyfers wandred astray, and helabouring in diligent search to finde them: within a while after theSchollers departure, came to seeke them in Woods about the Tower, and,notwithstanding all his crying and calling for his beasts, yet heheard the Ladies greevous moanes and lamentations. Wherefore, he cryedout so lowd as he could, saying: Who is it that mourneth so aloft onthe Tower? Full well she knew the voyce of her peazant, andtherefore called unto him, and sayd in this maner.

　　Go (quoth she) I pray thee for my Waiting-woman Ancilla, and bid hermake some meanes to come up hither to me. The Clowne knowing his Lady,sayde. How now Madame? Who hath carried you up there so high? YourWoman Ancilla hath sought for you all this day, yet no one couldever have immagined you to bee there. So looking about him, heespyed the two sides of the Ladder, which the Scholler had pulled insunder; as also the steppes, which he had scattered thereabout;placing them in due order againe as they should bee, and bindingthem fast with Withies and Willowes.

　　By this time Ancilla was come thither, who so soone as shee wasentred into the Tower, could not refrain from teares and complaints,beating her hands each against other, and crying out. Madam, deareLady and Mistresse! Alas, Wher are you? So soone as she heard thetongue of Ancilla, she replyed (so well as she could) saying: Ah mysweet Woman, I am heere aloft uppon the Tarras; weepe not, neythermake any noyse, but quickely bring me some of my Garments. When sheeheard her answer in such comfortable maner, she mounted up the Ladder,which the peazant had made very firme and strong, holding it fastfor her safer ascending; by which meanes she went up on the Tarras.Beholding her Ladie in so strange a condition, resembling no humanebody, but rather the trunke of a Tree halfe burned, lying flat onher face, naked, scorched and strangely deformed: shee beganne toteare the lockes of her owne hayre, raving and raging in aspittifull manner, as if her Ladie had beene quite dead. Which stormingtempest, Madame Helena soone pacified, entreating her to usesilence, and helpe to put on her garments.

　　Having understood by her, that no one knew of her being there, butsuch as brought her cloathes, and the poore peazant, attending therestill to do her any service: shee became the better comforted,entreating them by all meanes, that it might bee concealed from anyfurther discovery, which was on eyther side, most faithfullieprotested.

　　The poore Clowne holpe to beare downe his Lady uppon his backe,because the Ladder stood not conveniently enough for her descending,neither were her limbes plyable for her owne use, by reason of theirrifts and smarting. Ancilla following after, and being more respectiveof her Lady, then her owne security in descending, missing the step inthe midst of the Ladder, fell downe to the ground, and quite brake herlegge in the fall, the paine whereof was so greevous to her, thatshe cried and roared extraordinarily, even like a Lyon in the desert.

　　When the Clowne had set his Lady safe on a faire green banke, hereturned to see what the waiting woman ayled, and finding her leg tobe quite broken: he caried her also to the same banke, and thereseated her by her Lady: who perceiving what a mischance had hapned,and she (from whom she expected her onely best helpe) to bee now infar greater necessity her selfe: shee lamented exceedingly,complaining on Fortunes cruel malice toward her, in thus heaping onemisery upon another, and never ceasing to torment her, especiallynow in the conclusion of all, and when shee thought all futureperils to be past.

　　Now was the Sun upon his setting, when the poore honest country-man,because darke night should not overtake them, conducted the Ladyhome to his owne house: and gaining the assistance of his two brethrenand wife, setting the waiting-woman in a Chaire, thither theybrought her in like manner. And questionles, there wanted no diligenceand comfortable language, to pacifie the Ladyes continualllamentations. The good wife, led the Lady into hir own poorelodging, where (such cates as they had to feede on) lovingly she setbefore her: conveying her afterward into her owne bed, and taking suchgood order, that Ancilla was carried in the night time to Florence, toprevent all further ensuing danger, by reason of her legs breaking.

　　Madame Helena, to colour this misfortune of her owne: as also thegreat mishap of her woman: forged an artificiall and cunning tale,to give some formall apparance of hir being in the Tower, perswadingthe poore simple Country people, that in a straunge accident ofthunder and lightning, and by the illusions of wicked spirits, allthis adventure hapned to her. Then Physitians were sent for; who,not without much anguish and affliction to the Ladie (by reason of herfleshes flaying off, with the Medicines and Emplaysters applyed to thebody) was glad to suffer whatsoever- they did, beside falling into avery dangerous Feaver; out of which she was not recovered in a longwhile after, but continued in daily dispayre of her life; beside otheraccidents hapning in her time of Physicke, utterly unavoydable in suchextreamities: and hardly had Ancilla her legge cured.

　　By this unexpected pennance imposed on Madame Helena, she utterlyforgot her amorous friend; and (from thence forward) carefully kepther selfe from fond loves allurements, and such scornfull behaviour,wherein she was most disorderly faulty. And Reniero the Scholler,understanding that Ancilla had broken her leg, r , which he reputed asa punishment sufficient for her, held himselfe satisfyed, becauseneither the Mistresse nor her Maide, could now make any great boast,of his nights hard entertainment, and so concealed all matters else.

　　Thus a wanton-headed Lady, could finde no other subject to worke hermocking folly on, but a learned Scholler, of whom shee made no morerespect, then any other ordinary man. Never remembring, that suchmen are expert (I cannot say all, but the greater part of them) tohelpe the frenzie of foolish Ladies, that must injoy their loosedesires, by Negromancy, and the Divelles meanes. Let it therefore(faire Ladies) be my loving admonition to you, to detest all unwomanlymocking and scorning, but more especiallie to Schollers.

　　Greevous, and full of compassion, appeared the hard Fortunes ofMadame Helena to be, having much descontented, and (well-neere)wearied all the Ladies in hearing them recounted. But because theywere very justly inflicted upon her, and according as (in equity) sheehad deserved, they were the more moderate in their commisseration:howbeit, they reputed the Scholler not onely over-obstinate, butalso too strict, rigorous and severe. Wherefore, when MadamePampinea had finished hir Novell, the Queene gave command to MadameFiammetta, that she should follow next with her discourse; wheretoshee shewing obedience, thus beganne.

　　Because it appeareth in my judgement (faire Ladyes) that theSchollers cruelty hath much displeased you, making you moremelancholly then this time requireth: I holde it therefore veryconvenient, that your contristed spirits should be chearfully revived,with matter more pleasing and delightfull. And therefore, I mean toreport a Novell of a certaine man, who too an injury done him, in muchmilder manner, and revenged his wrong more moderately, then thefurious incensed Scholler did. Whereby you may comprehend, that itis sufficient for any man, and so he ought to esteeme it, to serveanother with the same sawce, which the offending party caused himfirst to taste of: without coveting any stricter revenge, then agreethwith the quality of the injury received.

　　Know then (Gracious assembly) that, as have heretofore heard,there lived not long since in Sienna, two young men, of honestparentage and equall condition, neither of the best, nor yet themeanest calling in the City: the one being named SpinelloccioTavena, and the other tearmed Zeppa di Mino, their houses Neighbouringtogether in the streete Camollia. Seldome the one walked abroadewithout the others Company, and their houses allowed equall welcome tothem both; so that by outward demonstrations, and inward mutuallaffection, as far as humane capacity had power to extend, they livedand loved like two Brethren, they both beeing wealthy, and marriedunto two beautifull women.

　　It came to passe, that Spinelloccio, by often resorting to the houseof Zeppa, as well in his absence, as when he abode at home; beganne toglance amorous looks on Zeppaes wife, and pursued his unneighbourlypurpose in such sort: that hee being the stronger perswader, and she(belike) too credulous in beleeving, or else overfeeble inresisting; from private imparlance, they fell to action; and continuedtheir close fight a long while together, unseene and withoutsuspition, no doubt to their equall joy and contentment.But, whether as a just punishment, for breaking so loving a league offriendship and neighbour-hood, or rather a fatall infliction, evermoreattending on the closest Cuckoldry, their felicity still continuing inthis kinde: it fortuned on a day, Zeppa abiding within doors, contraryto the knowledge of his wife, Spinelloccio came to enquire for him,and she answering (as she verily supposed) that he was gon abroad:uppe they went both together into the Hall, and no bodie being thereto hinder what they intended, they fell to their wonted recreationwithout any feare, kissing and embracing as Lovers use to do.

　　Zeppa seeing all this, spake not one word, neither made any noise atall; but kept himselfe closely hidden, to observe the yssue of thisamorous conflict. To be briefe, he saw Spinelloccio goe with hiswife into the Chamber, and make the doore fast after them, whereathe could have beene angry, which he held to be no part of truewisedome. For he knew well enough, that to make an out crie in thiscase, or otherwise to reveale this kinde of injury, it could no waymake it lesse, but rather give a greater addition of shame andscandall: he thought this no course for him to take; wiserconsiderations entred his braine, to have this wrong fully revenged,yet with such a discreete and orderly carriage, as no neighboursknowledge should by any meanes apprehend it, or the least sig ofdiscontent in himselfe blabbe it, because they were two dangerousevils.

　　Many notable courses whee.ed about his conceit, every onepromising fairely, and ministring meanes of formall apparance, yet one(above the rest) wonne his absolute allowance, which he intended toprosecute as best he might. In which resolution, he kept still veryclose, so long as Spinelloccio was with his Wife; but hee beinggone, he went into the Chamber, where he found his wife, amendingthe forme of her head attyre, which Spinelloccio had put into adisordred fashion. Wife (quoth be) what art thou doing? Why? Do younot see Husband? answered she. Yes that I do wife, replied Zeppa,and something else happened to my sight, which I could wish that I hadnot seene. Rougher Language growing betweene them, of his avouching,and her as stout denying, with defending her cause over-weakely,against the manifest proofes both of eye and eare: at last she fell onher knees before him, weeping incessantly, and no excuses nowavailing, she confest her long acquaintance with Spinelloccio, andmost humbly entreated him to forgive her. Uppon the which penitentconfession and submission, Zeppa thus answered.

　　Wife, if inward contrition be answerable to thy outward seemingsorrow, then I make no doubt, but faithfully thou dost acknowledgethine owne evill dooing: for which, if thou expectest pardon of me;determine then to fulfill effectually, such a busines as I mustenjoyne, and thou performe. I command thee to tell Spinelloccio,that to morrow morning, about nine of the clocke, we being both abroadwalking, he must finde some apt occasion to leave my company, and thencome hither to visit thee. When he is here, sodainly will I returnehome, and upon thy hearing of my entraunce: to save his ownecredite, and thee from detection, thou shalt require him to enter thisChest, untill such time as I am gone forth againe; which he doing, forboth your safeties, so soon as he is in the chest, take the key andlocke him up fast. When thou hast effected this, then shall I acquaintthee with the rest remaining, which also must be done by thee, withoutdread of the least harme to him or thee, because there is no maliciousmeaning in me, but such as (I am perswaded) thou canst not justlymislike. The wife, to make some satisfaction for her offence committedpromised that she would performe it, and so she did.

　　On the morrow morning, the houre of nine being come, when Zeppaand Spinelloccio were walking abroad together, Spinelloccio remembringhis promise unto his Mistresse, and the clocke telling him theappointed houre, hee saide to Zeppa. I am to dine this day with anespeciall friend of mine, who I would be loath should tarry for mycomming; and therefore holde my departure excused. How now? answeredZeppa, the time for dinner is yet farre enough off, wherefore thenshould we part so soone? Yea but Zeppa, replied Spinelloccio, wee haveweighty matters to confer on before dinner, which will require threehoures space at the least, and therefore it behoveth me to respect duetime.

　　Spinelloccio being departed from Zeppa (who followed faire andsoftly after him)

　　being come to the house, and kindly welcommed by the wife: they wereno sooner gone up the staires, and entering in at the Chamber doore;but the Woman heard her Husband cough, and also his comming up thestaires. Alas deare Spinelloccio (quoth she) what shall we do? MyHusband is comming uppe, and we shall be both taken tardie, stepinto this Chest, lye downe there and stirre not, till I have senthim forth againe, which shall be within a very short while.Spinelloccio was not a little joyfull for her good advice; downe inthe Chest lay he, and she lockt him in: by which time Zeppa was entredthe Chamber. Where are you Wife? said he, (speaking so loud, as hee inthe Chest might heare him) What, is it time to go to dinner? It willbe anon Sir, answered she, as yet it is overearly but seeing you arecome, the more hast shall be made, and every thing will be readyquickly.

　　Zeppa, sitting downe upon the Chest, wherein Spinelloccio lay nota little affrighted, speaking stil aloud, as formerly he did: Comehither Wife (quoth he) how shall we do for some good companie todine with us? Mine honest kinde neighbour Spinelloccio is not at home,because he dineth forth to day with a deare friend of his, by whichmeanes, his wife is left at home alone: give her a call out at ourWindow, and desire her to come dine with us: for we two can make nomerry Musicke, except some more come to make up the consort.

　　His Wife being very timorous, yet diligent to doe whatsoever hecommanded, so prevailed with the Wife of Spinelloccio: that she cameto them quickely, and so much the rather, because her Husband dinedabroad. Shee being come up into the Chamber, Zeppa gave her most kindeentertainment, taking her gently by the hand, and winking on his Wife,that she should betake her selfe to the kitchin, to see dinnerspeedily prepared, while he sat conversing with his neighbour in theChamber.

　　His wife being gone, he shut the doore after her; which the new-comeNeighbour perceyving, she sayde. Our blessed Lady defend me. Zeppa,What is your meaning in this? Have you caused me to come hither tothis intent? Is this the love you beare to Spinelloccio, and yourprofessed loyalty in friendshippe? Zeppa, seating her downe on theChest, wherein her Husband was inclosed, entreating her patience, thusbegan. Kinde and loving Neighbor, before you adventure too farre inanger, vouchsafe to heare what I shall tell you.

　　I have loved, and still doe love, Spinelloccio as my brother, butyesterday (albeit he knoweth it not) I found, the honest trust Ireposed in him, deserved no other, or better recompence, but even tobe bold with my wife, in the selfesame manner as I am, and as heeought to do with none but you. Now, in regard of the love which Ibeare him, I intend to be no otherwise revenged on him, but in thesame kinde as the offence was committed. He hath bin more thenfamiliar with my wife. I must borrow the selfe-same courtesie ofyou, which in equity you cannot deny mee, weighing the wrong youhave sustained by my wife. Our injuries are alike, in your Husbandto me, and in my wife to you: let then their punishment and ours bealike also; as they, so we; for in this case there can be no justerrevenge.The Woman hearing this, and perceiving the manifolde confirmationsthereof, protested (on solemne oath) by Zeppa; hir beliefe grewsetled, and thus she answered. My loving neighbor Zeppa, seeing thiskinde of revenge is (in meere justice) imposed on mee, and ordained asa due scourge, as well to the breach of friendship andneighbourhood, as abuse of his true and loyall wife: I am the morewilling to consent: alwaies provided, that it be no imbarrement oflove betweene your wife and mee, albeit I have good reason to alledge,that she began the quarrell first: and what I do is but to right mywrong, as any other woman of spirit would do: Afterwards, we may themore pardon one another. For breach more easi of peace (answeredZeppa) between my wife and you, take my honest word for yourwarrant. Moreover, in requitall of this favour to mee, I willbestowe a deare and precious jewell on you, excelling all the restwhich you have beside.

　　In delivering these words, he sweetly kissed and embraced her, asshe sat on the Chest wherein her husband lay: now, what they didelse beside, in recompence of the wrong received, I leave to yourimagination, as rather deserving silence, then immodest blabbing.Spinelloccio, being all this while in the Chest, hearing easily allthe words which Zeppa had uttered, the answer of his wife, as alsowhat Musicke they made over his head: you may guesse in what a case hewas, his heart being ready to split with rage, and, but that hee stoodin feare of Zeppa, he would have railde and exclaimed on his wife,as thus hee lay shut up in the Chest. But entering into betterconsideration, that so great al injury was first begun by himselfe,and Zeppa did no more, then in reason and equity he might well do(having evermore carried himselfe like a kinde neighbour and frendtowards him, without the least offer of distaste) he faithfullyresolved, to be a firmer friend to Zeppa then formerly hee had bin, ifit might be embraced and accepted.

　　Delights and pleasures, be they never so long in contenting andcontinuance, yet they come to a period and conclusion at last: SoZeppa, having ended his amorous combate, and over the head of hisperfidious friend, thought himselfe sufficiently revenged. But now, inconsideration of a further promise made on the bargaine;Spinelloccioes wife challengeth the jewel, then which kind ofrecompence, nothing can be more welcom to women. Heereupon, Zeppacalling for his owne wife, commanded her to open the Chest; which sheedid, and he merrily smiling, saide. Well wife, you have given mee aCake insted of bread, and you shal lose nothing for your labour. SoSpinelloccio comming forth of the Chest, it requireth a better wittethen mine, to tell you, which of them stood most confounded withshame, either Spinelloccio seeing Zeppa, and knowing well enoughwhat he had done: or the woman beholding her husband, who easily heardall their familiar conference, and the action thereupon sodeservedly performed.

　　See neighbour, is not this your dearest Jewell? Having kept itawhile in my wives custody; according to my promise, here I deliver ityou. Spinellcccio being glad of his deliverance out of the Chest,albeit not a little ashamed of himselfe; without using manyimpertinent words saide. Zeppa, our wrongs are equally requited oneach other, and therefore I allow thy former speeches to my Wife, thatthou wast my friend, as I am the like to thee, and so I pray theelet us still continue. For nothing else is now to bee divided betweeneus, seeing we have shared alike in our wives, which none knowing butour selves, let it be as closely kept to our selves. Zeppa was welpleased with the motion, and so all foure dined lovingly together,without any variance or discontentment. And thence forward, each ofthe Women had two Husbands, as either Husband enjoyed two Wives,without further contention or debate.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS APPROVED, THAT TITLES OF HONOUR, LEARNING, AND

　　DIGNITY, ARE NOT ALWAYES BESTOWNE ON THE WISEST MEN

　　Maestro Simone, an ydle-headed Doctor of Physicke, was throwne byBruno and Buffalmaco, into a common Leystall of Filth: The Physitianfondly beleeving, that (in the night time) he should bee made one of anew created Company, who usually went to see wonders at Corsica; andthere in the Leystall they left him.

　　After that the Ladies had a while considered, on the communicationbetweene the two Wives of Sienna, and the falshood in friendship oftheir Husbands: the Queene, who was the last to recount her Novell,without offering injurie to Dioneus, began to speake thus.

　　The reward for a precedent wrong committed, which Zeppa retortedupon Spinelloccio, was answerable to his desert, and no more thenequity required, in which respect, I am of opinion, that such menought not to be over-sharpely reproved, as do injurie to him, whoseeketh for it, and justly should have it, althogh Madam Pampinea (notlong since) avouched the contrary.

　　Now, it evidently appeareth, that Spinelloccio well deserved whatwas done to him, and I purpose to speake of another, who needs wouldseeke after his owne disgrace.

　　The rather to confirme my former speeches, that they which beguilesuch wilfull foolish men; are not to bee blamed, but rather commended.And he unto whom the shame was done, was a Physitian, which camefrom Bologna to Florence; and returned thither againe like unto aBeast, notoriously baffulled and disgraced.

　　It is a matter well knowne- to us, and (almost) observed day by day,that divers of our Citizens, when they returne from their studyingat Bologna: one becommeth an Advocate, another a Physitian, and athird a Notarie, with long and large gowns, some of Scarlet, and hoodsfurred with Minever, beside divers other great apparances,succeeding effectually daily in their severall kinds. Among whom,there returned (not long since) thence, one Master. Simon da Villa,more rich in possessions left him by his parents, then anieknowledge thereto obtained: yet cloathed in Scarlet, with hisMiniver hood, and styled a Doctor of Physicke, which title hee onelybestowed on himselfe, and tooke a goodly house for his dwelling, inthe street which wee commonly call La via del Cocomero. This MasterDoctor Simon, being thus newly come thither, among other notablequalities in him, had one more especial then any of the rest,namely, to know the names and conditions of such persons, as dailypassed by his doore, and what professions they were of, wherby anylikelyhood might be gathered of needing his helpe, and being hispatients, observing them all with very vigilant care.

　　But, among all the rest by him thus warily noted, he most observedtwo Painters, of whom we have heeretofore twice discoursed, Brunoand Buffalmaco, who walked continually together, and were his neeredwelling neighbors. The matter which most of al he noted in them, was;that they lived merrily, and with much lesse care, then any else inthe Cittie beside, and verily they did so in deede. Wherefore, hedemanded of divers persons, who had good understanding of them both,of what estate and condition they were. And hearing by every one, thatthey were but poore men and Painters: he greatly mervailed, how itcould be possible for them, that they should live so jocondly, andin such poverty. It was related to him further beside, that theywere men of a quicke and ingenious apprehension, whereby heepolitikely imagined, that theyr poore condition could not so wellmaintaine them; without some courses else, albeit not publiquelyknowne unto men, yet redounding to their great commoditie and profite.In which regard, he grew exceeding desirous, by what meanes he mightbecome acquainted, and grow into familiarity with them both, or any ofthem, at the least: wherein (at the length) he prevailed, and Brunoproved to be the man.

　　Now Bruno plainly perceiving (within a short while of this new begunacquaintance) that the Physitian was a Loggerhead, and meerely nobetter then a Gregorian Animall: he beganne to have much goodpastime with him, by telling him strange and incredible Tales, such asnone but a Coxcombe would give credit too; yet they delighted DoctorDunce extraordinarily, and Brunoes familiarity was so highlypleasing to him, that he was a daily guest at dinner and supper withhim, and hee was not meanly proud of enjoying his company. One day, asthey sate in familiar conference together, he told Bruno that hewondred not a little at him and Buffalmaco, they being both so poorepeople, yet lived far more jovially then Lords, and thereforedesired to understand, by what secret meanes they compassed suchmirthful maintenance. Bruno, hearing the Doctors demaund, andperceiving that it savoured more of the foole, then any the very leasttaste of wisedome: smiled unto himselfe, and determined to returne himsuch an answere, as might be fitting for his folly, whereupon, thus hereplied.

　　Beleeve me Master Doctor, I would not impart to many people, whatprivate helpes we have for our maintenance: but yet I dare boldlyacquaint you therewith, in regard you are one of our most intimatefriends, and of such secrecie, as (I know) you will not reveale itto any. True it is, that mine honest neighbor and my selfe, do leadeour lives in such merry manner as you see, and better then all theworld is aware of, for I cannot imagine you to bee so ignorant, butare certainly perswaded: that if we had no better means, then ourpoore manuall trade and profession; we might sit at home with breadand water, and be nothing so lively spirited as wee are. Yet Sir, Iwould not have you to conceive, that wee do eyther rob or steale, oruse any other unlawfull courses: onely we travayle to Corsica, fromwhence we bring (without the least prejudice to anie other) all thingswe stand in need of, or whatsoever wee can desire. Thus do wemaintaine our selves well and honestly, and live in this mirthfulldisposition.

　　Master Doctor hearing this Discourse, and beleeving it constantly,without any further instruction or intelligence: became possessed withverie much admiration, and had the most earnest desire in the world,to know what this Travailing to Corsica might meane: entreatingBruno with very great instances, to tell him what it was, and mademany protestations never to disclose it to anie one. How now MasterDoctor? answered Bruno, What a strange motion do you make to mee? Itis too great a secret, which you desire to know, yea, a matter of mineowne ruine, and an utter expulsion out of this Worlde, withcondemnation into the mouth of Lucifer da San Gallo, if any manwhatsoever should know it from me, wherefore I pray you to urge itno more. O my deer and honest neighbour Bruno (quoth the Doctor)assure thy selfe upon my soul, that whatsoever thou revealest to me,shall be under seale from all, but onely our selves. Fie, fie MasterDoctor, answered Bruno, you are too pressing and importunate. Sositting smiling to himselfe, shaking his head, and beating his breast,as if hee were in some straunge distraction of minde, stamping withhis feete, and beating his Fiste oftentimes on the Table, at ast hestarted uppe, and spake in this manner.

　　Ah Master Doctor, the love I be to your capricious and rarelycircumcised experience, and likewise the confidence I repose in yourscrutinous taciturnitie, are both of such mighty and prevailingpower as I cannot conceale any thing from you, which you covet toknow. And therefore, if you wil sweare unto me by the crosse ofMonteson, that never (as you have already faithfully promised) youwill disclose a secret so admirable; I will relate it unto you, andnot otherwise. The Doctor sware, and sware againe, and then Bruno thusbegan.

　　Know then my learned and judicious Doctor, that it is not longtime since, when there lived in this Citie of ours, a man veryexcellent in the Art of Nigromancie, who named himselfe Michale Scoto,because he was a Scottishman borne, of many woorthy Gentlemen (veryfew of them being now living) hee was much honoured and respected.When he grew desirous to depart from hence, upon their earnestmotion and entreaty; he left here two of his Schollers behinde him,men of absolute skill and experience: giving them especial chargeand command, to do all possible services they could devise, forthose Gentlemen who had so highly honoured him. The two famousSchollers, were very helpefull to those Gentlemen, in divers oftheir amorous occasions, and verie many other matters besides.

　　Not long after, they finding the Citie, and behaviour of thepeople sufficiently pleasing to them; they resolved on theircontinuance heere, entering into a league of love and friendshippewith divers, never regarding, whether they were Gentlemen, or no, ordistinguishing the poore from the rich: but only in being conformeto their complexions, sociable and fit for friendship.

　　They created a kinde Society, consisting of about five and twentymen, who should meete together twice in a moneth, and in a placereputed convenient for them: where being so assembled, every manuttered his minde to those two Schollers, in such cases as they mostdesired, to have wherwith they were all satisfied the self-same night.It came so to passe, that Buffalmaco and I, grew into acquaintancewith those two worthy Schollers, and our private familiaritytogether proved so prosperous, that we were admitted into the sameSociety, and so have ever since continued. Now Sir, I am to tell youmatter deserving admiration, and which (in very good judgements) wouldseeme to exceed all beleefe.

　　For, at every time when we were assembled together: you are not ableto imagine, what sumptuous hangings of Tapistrie, did adorne theHall where we sate at meate, the Tables covered in such Royall manner,waited on by numberless Noble and goodly attendants, both Women andMen, serving readily, at each mans command of the company. The Basins,Ewers, Pots, Flaggons, and all the vessels else which stood before,and for the service of our diet, being composed onely of Gold andSilver, and out of no worse did we both eate and drinke: the viandsbeing very rare and dainty, abounding in plenty and variety, accordingto the appetite of everie person, as nothing could be wished for,but it was instantly obtained.

　　In good sadnesse Sir, I am not able to remember and tell you (withinthe compasse of a thousand yeares) what, and how manie severall kindesof Musicall Instruments, were continually played on before us; whatmultiplicity of Waxe lights burned in all partes of the roomes;neither the excessive store of rich Drugs, Marchpanes, Comfites, andrare Banquetting stuffe, consumed there at one Feasting, wherein therewanted no bounty of the best and purest wines. Nor do I (MasterDoctor) repute you so weakly witted, as to think, that in the timeof our being thus assembled there, any of us al were cloathed insuch simple and meane Garments, as ordinarily are worne in the streetson mens bodies, or any so silly as the verie best you have: No Sir,not any one man among us, but appeared by his apparrell, equall to thegreatest Emperour on the earth, his robe most sumptuouslyimbroidered with precious stones, Pearles, and Carbuncles, as theworld affoordeth not the like. But above all the rest, the delightsand pleasures there, are beyond my capacity to expresse, or(indeede) any comparison: as namely, store of goodly and beautifullwomen, brought thither from all parts of the world; alwayesprovided, if men bee desirous of their company: but for your easiercomprehension, I will make some briefe relation of them to you,according as I heard them there named.

　　There is the great Lady of Barbanicchia; the Queene of Baschia;the Wife to the great Soldane, the Empresse of Osbeccho; theCiancianfera of Norniera; the Semistante of Berlinzona; and theScalpedra of Narsia. But why do I breake my braine, in numbering up somany to you? All the Queenes of the world are there, even so farreas to the Schinchimurra of Prester John, that hath a horne in themidst of her posteriores, albeit not visible to every eye.

　　Now I am further that after we have tasted a Cup of precious Wine,fed on a few delicate Comfits, and danced a dance or two to the rareMusicke: every one taketh a Lady by the hand, of whom he pleaseth tomake his election, and she conducteth him to her Chamber, in verygrave and gracious manner. Concerning the Chambers there, each of themresembleth a Paradise to looke on, they are so faire and goodly; andno lesse odorifferous in smell, then the sweetest perfumes in yourApothecaries shoppes, or the rare compounds of Spices, when they arebeaten in an open Morter. And as for the Beds, they are infinitelyricher, then the verie costliest belonging to the Duke of Venice:yet (in such) each man is appointed to take his rest, the Musicke ofrare Cymbals lasting all night long, much better to be by youconsidered, then in my rude eloquence expressed.

　　But of all those rich and sumptuous Beds (if pride of mine owneopinion do not deceive me) them two provided for Buffalmaco and me,had hardly any equall: he having the Queene of France as his Ladyand Mistresse, and I, the renowned Queene of England, the onely twochoise beauties of the whole World, and wee appeared so pleasing intheir eyes, as they would have refused the greatest Monarkes on theearth, rather then to bee rejected by us. Now therefore, you mayeasily consider with your selfe, what great reason we have to livemore merrily, then any other men can doe: in regard we enjoy thegracious favour of two such Royall Queenes, receyving also from them(whensoever wee please to commaund them) a thousand or two thousandFlorines at the least, which are both truly and duly sent us. Enjoyingthus the benefit of this high happinesse, we that are companions ofthis Society, do tearme it in our vulgar Language, The Pyrats voyageto Corsica. Because, as Rovers or Pyrats robbe and take away thegoodes of such as they meete withall, even so do we: only thereremaineth this difference betweene us, that they never restore whatthey have taken: which we do immediately afterward, whether it berequired or no. And thus Master Doctor, as to my most endeered friend,I have now revealed the meaning of sayling to Corsica, after themanner of our private Pyracie, and how important the close retentionof the voiage is, you are best able your selfe to judge: In whichregarde, remember your Oathes and faithfull promises, or else I amundone for ever.

　　Our worthy wise Doctor, whose best skill scarsely extended so farre,as to cure the itch in Children; gave such sound beleefe to therelation of Bruno, as any man could doe, to the most certaine truth ofife or death: having his desire immeasurably enflamed, to bee made amember of this straunge Societie, which hee more coveted, then anything in the world beside, accounting it a felicity farre beyond allother.

　　Whereupon he answered Bruno, that it was no great matter ofmervaile, if he lived so merily as he did, having such a singularsupply, to avoide all necessities whatsoever: and very hardly could herefraine from immediate request, to be accepted into the company.But yet he thought fit to deferre it further, untill he had made Brunomore beholding to him, by friendly entertainments and othercourtesies, when he might (with better hope) be bold to move themotion.

　　Well may you conceive, that nothing more hammerd in the Doctorshead, then this rare voyage to Corsica, and Bruno was his dailyguest at dinner and supper, with such extraordinary apparances ofkindnesse and courtesie, as if the Physitian could not live, except hehad the company of Bruno. Who seeing himselfe to bee so lovinglyrespected, and hating ingratitude, for favours so abundantly heaped onhim: hee painted the whole story of Lent about his Hall, and anAgnus Dei fairely gilt, on the portall of his Chamber, as also agoodly Urinall on his street doore, to the end, that such as had needeof his counsell, might know where so judicious a Doctour dwelt. In aGallery likewise by his Garden, he painted the furious Battailebetweene the Rats and Cats, which did (not a little) delight MasterDoctor.

　　Moreover, at such times as Bruno had not supt with our Physitian, hewould bee sure to tell him on the morrow, that the night passed, hehad bin with the Company which he did wot of. And there (quoth he) theQueene of England having somewhat offended mee, I commanded, thatthe Gomedra, belonging to the Grand Cham of Tartaria, should bebrought me, and instantly shee was. What may be the meaning ofGomedrabe? said the Doctor, I understand not those difficult names.I beleeve you Sir, answered Bruno, nor do I need to marvallethereat: and yet I have heard Porcograsso speake, and also Vannacenna,and both unexperienced in our Language. You would say (replyed theDoctor) Hippocrates and Avicenna, who were two admirable Physitians.It may be so (said Bruno) and as hardly do I understand your names, asyou mine: but Gomedra, in the Grand Chams language, signifies Empressein ours. But had you once seene her Sir, she would make you forget allPhysicall observations, your arguments, receits, and medicines,onely to be in her heavenly presence, which words he used(perceiving his forward longing) to enflame him the more. Not longafter, as the doctor was holding the candle to Bruno, at theperfecting the bloody Battayle of the Cattes and Rattes, because hecould never bee wearied in his Companie, and therefore was the morewilling, to undergoe the office of the Candle-holder: he resolved toacquaint him with his minde, and being all alone by themselves, thushe began.

　　Bruno, as heaven knoweth, there is not this day any creature living,for whom I would gladly do more, then for thee, and the very leastword of thy mouth, hath power to commaund mee to goe bare-footed, evenfrom hence so farre as to Peretola, and account my labour wellemployed for thy sake: wherefore, never wonder at my continuallkindnesse towards thee, using thee as my Domesticke companion, andembracing thee as my bosome friend, and therefore I am the bolder inmooving one request unto thee. As thou well knowest, it is no longwhile since, when thou diddest acquaint me with the behaviour of theCorsicane Roving Company, to be one in so rare and excellent aSociety, such hath bin my earnest longing ever since, as day nor nighthave I enjoyed anie rest, but should thinke my felicity beyond allcompare, if I could be entertained in fellowship among you.

　　Nor is this desire of mine but upon great occasion, as thou thyselfe shalt perceive, if I prove accepted into your Societie, andlet me then be made a mocking stocke for ever, if I cause not tocome thither one of the most delicate young women, that ever anieeye beheld, and which I my selfe saw (not above a yeare since) atCacavinciglia, on whom I bestowed my intirest affection, and (by thebest Urinall that ever I gazed on) would have given her tenne faireBologninaes, to yeeld the matter I moved to her, which yet I could not(by any meanes) compasse. Therefore, with all the flowing faculties ofmy soule I entreate thee, and all the very uttermost of my allindeede; to instruct me in those wayes and meanes, whereby I mayhope to be a member of you. Which if thou dooest accomplish for me,and I may finde it effectually performed: I shall not onely be thytrue and loyall friend for ever, but will honour thee beside, beyondall men living.

　　I know thee to bee a man of judgement, deepely informed in allwell-grounded experience: thou seest what a propper, portly, andcomely man I am, how fitly my legges are answerable to my body, mylookes amiable, lovely, and of Rosie colour: beside I am a Doctor ofPhysicke, of which profession (being only most expedient) I thinke youhave not one in your Society. I have many commendable qualities in me,as, playing on divers instruments, exquisite in singing, and composingrare ditties, whereof I will instantly sing thee one. And so hebegan to sing.

　　Bruno was swolne so bigge with desire of laughter, that hee hadscarsely any power to refraine from it: neverthelesse, he made thebest meanes he could devise: and the Song being ended, the Physitionsaide. How now Bruno? What is thine opinion of my singing? Beleeveme Sir, replyed Bruno, the Vialles of Sagginali, will loose their verybest times, in contending against you, so mirilifficially are thesweet accents of your voice heard. I tell thee truly Bruno (answeredMaster Doctor) thou couldst not by any possibility have beleeved it,if thou hadst not heard it. In good sadnes Sir (said Bruno) you speakemost truly. I could (quoth the Doctor) sing thee infinite more beside,but at this time I must forbeare them. Let mee then further informethee Bruno, that beside the compleat perfections thou seest in me,my father was a Gentleman, althogh he dwelt in a poore Countryvillage, and by my mothers side, I am derived from them of Vallecchio.Moreover, as I have formerly shewn thee, I have a goodly Library ofBookes, yea, and so faire and costly garments, as few Physitians inFlorence have the like. I protest to thee upon my faith, I have onegowne, which cost me (in readie money) almost an hundred poundes inBagattinoes, and it is not yet above ten yeares old. Wherefore letme prevaile with thee, good Bruno, to worke so with the rest of thyfriends, that I may bee one of your singular Society; and, by thehonest trust thou reposest in mee, bee boldly sick whensoever thouwilt, my paines and Physicke shall be freely thine, without thepayment of one single peny. Bruno hearing his importunate words, andknowing him (as all men else did beside) to be a man of more wordsthen wit, saide. Master Doctor, snuffe the candle I pray you, and lendme a little more light with it hitherward, until I have finished thetailes of these Rats, and then I wil answer you.

　　When the Rats tailes were fully finished, Bruno declaring by outwardbehaviour, that he greatly distasted the matter mooved, thus answered.Worthy Master Doctor, the courtesies you have already extended towardsme, and the bountifull favours promised beside, I know to be exceedinggreat, and farre beyond the compasse of any merit in me. Butconcerning your request, albeit in respect of your admired braineand Wisedome, it is of little or no moment at all; yet it appearethover-mighty to mee, and there is not any man now living in theworld, that hath the like Authoritie over me, and can more commaundme, then you (with one poore syllable) easily may doe: as well inregarde of my Love and Dutie, as also your singular and sententiousspeeches, able not onelie to make me breake a sound and setledresolution, but (almost) to move Mountaines out of their places, andthe more I am in your Learned company, so much the faster am I linckedunto you, in immooveable affection, so farre am I in love with youradmirable qualities. And had I no other reason, to affect you insuch endeared manner, as I doe; yet because you are enamoured of sorare a beauty, as you have already related to me, it onely were amotive sufficient to compell me. But indeed I must need tell you, thatI have not so much power in this case, as you (perhaps) do imagine,which barreth me from such forward readines, as otherwise needed notto be urged. Neverthelesse, having so solemnly ingaged your faith tome, and no way misdoubting your faithfull secrecy, I shall instructyou in some meanes to be observed; and it appeareth plainly to me,that being furnished with such plenty of Bookes, as you are, and otherrich endowments, as you have before rehersed, you cannot but attaineto the full period of your longing desire.

　　Speake boldly thy minde Bruno, answered the Doctour: for, I perceivethou hast no perfect knowledge of me as yet, neither what an especiallgift I have of secrecy. Messer Gasparino da Salicete, when he wasJudge and Potestat over the people of Forlini, made choise of mee(among infinite of his dearest friends) to acquaint with a secret ofno meane moment. And such a faithfull Secretary he found me, as Iwas the onely man, that knew his mariage with Bergamino; why thenshould any distrust be made of me? If it be so as you say Sir(answered Bruno) your credit is the sounder, and I dare the betteradventure on your fidelity: the meanes then which you are to worke by,I shall now direct you in.

　　We have alwayes in this noble Society of ours, a Captaine, and twoCounsellors, which are changed at every six months end. And now atChristmas next (so neere drawing on) Buffalmaco shal be electedCaptaine, and my selfe one of the Counsellers, for so it is alreadyagreed on, and orderly set downe. Now, he that is Captain, may doemuch more then any other can, and appoint matters as himselfepleaseth. Wherefore I thinke it very expedient, that so soone aspossibly you may, you procure acquaintance with Buffalmaco, entreatinghim with all respective courtesie. Hee is a man, who when heperceyveth you to be so wonderfully Wise and discreete, he will beimmediatly in love with you: so, when you have your best sensesabout you, and your richest wearing Garments on (alwayes remembred,that your acquaintance first be fully confirmed) then never feare tourge your request, for he can have no power at all to denie you;because I have already spoken of you to him, and find him to standaffected unto you verie intirely: thus when you have begunne thebusinesse, leave me to deale with him in the rest.

　　Now trust me kinde friend Bruno, replyed the Physitian, I likeyour advice exceeding well. For, if hee be a man, that takethdelight to converse with men of skill and judgement, and you have madethe way for his knowing me: he wil him thirst, and long to followafter mee, to understand the incredible eloquence flowing from me, andthe rare composition of my Musicall Ditties, out of which he maylearne no meane wisedome. When the matter was thus agreed onbetweene them, Bruno departed thence, and acquainted Buffalmaco witheverie circumstance: which made him thinke everie day a yeare,untill he might in the fooling of Mayster Doctoar, according to hisowne fancie. Who beeing also as desirous on the other side, to makeone in the Corsicane Voyage; could take no manner of rest either byday or night, till he was linked in friendship with Buffalmaco,which very quickely after hee compassed.

　　For now there wanted no costly dinners and suppers, with aldelicates could be devised, for the entertainement of Buffalmaco andBruno; who, like Guests very easie to be invited, where rich wines andgood cheare are never wanting, needed little sending for, becausehis house was as familiar to them, as their owne. In the end, when thePhysitian espyed an opportunitie apt for the purpose, he made the samerequest to Buffalmaco, as formerly hee had done to Bruno. WhereatBuffalmaco, sodainly starting, and looking frowningly on Bruno, asif he were extraordinarily incensed against him: clapping his handfuriously on the Table, he sayde. I sweare by the great God ofPasignano, that I can hardly refrayne from giving thee such a blowon the face, as should make thy Nose to fall at thy heeles: vileTraitor as thou art: for none beside thy selfe, could discover so rareand excellent a secret unto this famous Physitian. The Doctour, withvery plausible and pleasing tearmes, excused the matter verieartificially; protesting, that another had revealed it unto him: andafter many wise circumstantiall Allegations, at length hee prevailedso farre, that Buffalmaco was pacified; who afterwardes turning inkinde manner, thus hee beganne.

　　Master Doctour, you have lived both at Bologna, and heere in thesepartes with us, having (no doubt) sufficiently understoode, what it isto carry a close mouth, I meane the true Charracter of taciturnitie.Questionlesse, you never learned the A. B. C. as now foolish Ideotsdo, blabbing their lessons all about the towne, which is much betterapprehended by rumination; and surely (if I be not much deceyved) yourNativity happened on a Sonday morning, Sol being at that time, Lord ofthe ascendent, joyned with Mercurie in a fierie Triplicitie. By suchconference as I have had with Bruno, I conceyved (as he himselfealso did) that you were verie singular in Physicke onely: but itseemeth, your Studies reached a higher straine, for you havelearned, and know verie skilfullie, how to steale mens hearts fromthem, yea, to bereave them of their verie soules, which I perceyvethat you can farre better doe, then any man else living to myknowledge, only by your wise, witty, judicious, and more then meereMercurian eloquence, such as I never heard before.

　　The Physitian interrupting him bashfully, turned himselfe untoBruno, saying. Did not I tell thee this before? Observe what a notablething it is, to speake well, and to frequent the company of theWise. A thousand other, meerely blockes and dullardes by Nature, couldnever so soone comprehend all the particularities of my knowledge,as this honest and apprehensive man hath done. Thou didst not searchinto it halfe so soone, nor (indeed) did I expresse a quarter of myingenuity to thee, as (since his comming) hath prodigally flownefrom me.

　　Well do I remember thy words, that Buffalmaco delighted to beamong men of Wisedome: and have I not now fitted him unto his ownedesire? How thinkest thou Bruno? The best (quoth Bruno) that any manliving in the World could do. Ah worthy Buffalmaco, answered thePhysitian: What wouldst thou then have sayde, if thou hadst seene meat Bologna, where there was neyther great nor small, Doctor norScholler, but thought themselves happy by being in my company? If Iought any debts, I discharged them with my very wittie words: andwhensoever I spake, I could set them al on a hearty laughter, somuch pleasure they tooke in hearing mee. And when I departed thence,no men in the world could bee more sorrowfull then they, as desiringnothing more then my remayning among them; which they expressed soapparantly, that they made humble suite and intercession to me, to beecheefe Reader of the Physicke-Lecture, to all the Schollers studyingour profession. But I could not be so perswaded, because my mindewas wholly addicted hither, to enjoy those Goods, Landes, andInheritances, belonging lineally to them of our house, and accordinglyI did performe it.

　　How now Buffalmaco (quoth Bruno) what is thine opinion now? Thouwouldst not beleeve me when I told thee, that there is not a Doctor inall these parts, more skilfull in distinguishing the Urine of an Asse,from any other, then this most expert and singular man: and I dareboldly maintaine it, that his fellow is not to bee found, from henceto the very gates of Paris. Go then, and doe the uttermost endeavourthat thou canst, to grant the request which he hath made.

　　Beleeve me Buffalmaco, saide the Doctor, Bruno hath spoken nothingbut truth, for I am scarsely knowne heere in this City, where (for themost part) they are all grosse-witted people, rather then any jotjudicious: but I would thou hadst seene me among the Doctors, inmanner as I was wont to be. In troth Sir, replyed Buffalmaco, youare much more Learned then ever I imagined, in which respect, speakunto you as it becommeth me, to a man so excellent in wit andunderstanding: I dare assure you, that (without any faile) I witprocure you to be one of our Company.

　　After this promise thus made, the good cheare, favors and kindnessesdone by the Doctor to them, was beyond the compasse of all relation:whereof they made no more then a meere mockery, flouting him to hisface, and yet his Wisedome could not discerne it. Moreover, theypromised, that they would give him to Wife, the faire Countesse diCivillari, who was the onely goodliest creature to be found in thewhole Culattario of humane generation. The Doctor demanded, whatCountesse that was? Oh Sir, answered Buffalmaco, she is a greatLady, one worthy to have issue by; and few houses are there in theworld, where she hath not some jurisdiction and command: so that notmeane people onely, but even the greatest Lords, at the sound of herTrumpets, do very gladlie pay her tribute. And I dare boldlyaffirme, that whensoever shee walketh to any place, she yeeldeth a hotand sensible savour, albeit she keepeth most of all close. Yet onceevery night, shee duely observeth it (as a Custome) to passe fromher owne house, to bathe her feete in the River of Arno, and take alittle of the sweeter Ayre: albeit her continuall residencie, iswithin the Kingdome of Laterino.

　　She seldome walketh abroad, but goeth with her attending Officersabout her, who (for more demonstration of her greatnesse) do carry theRod and plummet of Lead. Store of her Lords and Barons are every whereto be seene; as the Tamagnino della porta, Don Meta di Sirropa; Manicodi Scopa; Signior Squacchera, and others beside, who are (as Isuppose) oftentimes your visitants, when of necessity they must beremembred. All our care and courtesie shall extend so farre (if we doenot falle in our enterprize) to leave you in the armes of so Majesticka Ladie, quite forgetting hir of Cacavinciglia.

　　The Physitian, who was borne and brought up at Bologna, andtherefore understoode not these Florentine tearmes: became fullycontented to enjoy the Ladie; and, within some few dayes following,the Painters brought him tydings, that they had prepared the way forhis entertainment into the Societie of Rovers. The day being come,when the supposed assembly was to be made the night following: thePhysitian invited them both to dinner; when he demanding, whatprovision he shold make for his entrance into their company,Buffalmaco returned him this answer, whereto hee gave very heedfullattention.

　　Master Doctor, you must be first of all, strongly armed withresolution and confidence: for, if you be not, you may not onlyreceyve hindrance, but also do us great harme beside: and now youshall heare, in what manner, and how you are to be bold andconstant. You must procure the meanes, this instant night, when allthe people are in their soundest sleepe, to stand upon one of thosehigh exalted Tombs or Monuments, which are in the churchyard ofSanta Maria Novella, with the very fairest gowne you have about you,because you may appeare in the more honorable condition, before theassembly seated together, and likewise to make good our speechesalready delivered of you, concerning your qualitie and profession:that the Countesse, perceyving you to bee a woorthie Gentleman, mayhave you first honoured with the Bathe, and afterward Knighted ather owne cost and charge. But you must continue stil upon the Tombe(dreadlesse of nightly apparitions and visions) untill such time as wesend for you.

　　And for your better information in every particulare; a Beaste,blacke and horned, but of no great stature, will come to fetch you:perhaps he will use some gastly noises, straunge leapes, and loftietrickes, onely to terrifie and affright you: but when he perceiveththat he cannot daunt you, hee will gently come neere you, which whenhe hath done, you may descend from off the Tombe; and, withoutnaming or thinking on God, or any of his Saintes, mount boldly onhis backe, for he will stand ready to receive you. Being so seated,crosse your armes over your brest, without presuming to touch orhandle the Beast, for he will carry you thence softly, and so bringyou along to the company. But if in all this time of your travaile,you call on heaven, any Saint, or bee possessed with the least thoughtof feare: I must plainely tell you, that either hee will cast youdangerously, or throw you into some noysom place. And therefore, ifyou know your selfe, not to be of a constant courage, and sprightlybold, to undertake such an adventure as this: never presume anyfurther, because you may doe us a great deale of injurie, withoutany gaine or benefite to your selfe, but rather such wrong, as wewould be very sorry should happen unto so deere a Friend.

　　Alas honest Buffalmaco, answered the Physitian, thou art not halfeacquainted with me as yet: because I walke with gloves upon myhands, and in a long Gowne, thou perhappes doest imagine mee afaint-hearted fellow. If thou didst know, what I have heeretofore doneat Bologna in the night time, when I and my Consorts went to visitepretty wenches, thou wouldst wonder at my couragious attempts. As I ama Gentleman, one night, we met with a young Bona Roba, a paltrygreene-sicknesse baggage, scarsely above a Cubite in height, andbecause she refused to go with us willingly, I gave her a kicke on thebum, and spurnde her more then a Crosse-bowe shoote in distance fromme, and made her walke with us whether she would, or no. Anothertime I remember, when having no other company but my boy, I wentthorow the Churchyard of the Fryars Minors, after the sounding ofAve Maria: a woman hadde beene buried there the very same day, and yetI was not a jotte affraid.

　　Wherefore, never be distrustfull of mee, but resolvedly buildeupon my courage. And in regard of my more honourable entertainment,I will then weare my Scarlet Gowne and Hood, wherein I receyved mygraduation; and then do both of you observe, what a rejoycing willbe among the whole company, at the entertaining of such a man as I am,enough to create me Captaine immediatly. You shall perceive also howthe case will go, after I have beene there but a while, in regard thatthe Countesse (having as yet never seene me) is so deepely enamored ofmee: she cannot choose but bestow the Bathe and Knighthood on me,which shee shall have the more honour of, in regard I am well ableto maintaine it, therefore referre all the rest to mee, and nevermisdoubt your injurie or mine.

　　Spoken like a Gallant, replyed Buffalmaco, and I feare not now,but we shall winne credite by your company. But be carefull I prayyou, that you make not a mockery of us, and come not at all, orfayle to be there, when the Beast shall be sent for you; I speake itthe rather, because it is cold weather, and you Gentlemen Physitianscan hardly endure it. You are carefull of mee (quoth the Doctor) and Ithanke you for it, but I applaud my faire Starres, I am none of yournice or easie-frozen fellowes, because cold weather is very familiarto me. I dare assure you, when I arise in the night time for thatnaturall office whereto all men are subject, I weare no warmerdefence, then my thin wastcoat over my shirt, and finde itsufficient for the coldest weather at any time. When Bruno andBuffalmaco had taken their leave, the Physitian, so soone as nightdrew neere, used many apt excuses to his wife, stealing forth hisScarlet Gowne and Hood unseene of any, wherewith being clothed: at thetime appointed, he got upon one of the Marble Tombes, staying there(quaking with cold) awaiting when the Beast should come. Buffalmaco,being a lusty tall man of person, had got an ugly masking suite,such as are made use of in Tragedies and Playes, the out-side being ofblack shagged haire, wherwith being cloathed, he seemed like a strangedeformed Beare, and a Divels vizard over his face, with two gastlyhorrible hornes, and thus disguised, Bruno following him, they went tobehold the issue of the businesse, so farre as the new Market place,closely adjoining to Santa Maria Novella.

　　Having espyed Master Doctor uppon the Tombe, Buffalmaco in hismishapen habite, began to bound, leape, and carriere, snuffling andblowing in mad and raging manner: which when the Physitian saw, hishaire stood on end, he quaked and trembled, as being more fearfullthen a Woman, wishing himselfe at home againe in his house, ratherthen to behold a sight so dreadfull. But because he was come forth,and had such an earnest desire, to see the wonders related to him;he made himselfe so coragious as possibly he could, and bare all outin formall manner. After that Buiffalmaco had (an indifferent while)plaide his horsetrickes, ramping and stamping somewhat strangely:seeming as become of much milder temper, he went neere to the Tombwhereon the Physitian stood, and there appeared to stay contentedly.

　　Master Doctor, trembling and quaking still extreamely, was sofarre dismayed, as he knew not what was best to be done, either tomount on the beasts backe, or not to mount at all. In the end,thinking no harme could happen to him, if he were once mounted, withthe second feare, hee expelled the former, and descending downe softlyfrom the Tombe, mounted on the beast, saying out alowde: God, SaintDominicke, and my good Angell helpe to defend mee. Seating himselfe sowell as he could, but trembling still exceedingly; he crossed hisarmes over his stomacke, according to the Lesson given him.

　　Then did Buffalmaco shape his course in milde manner, toward SantaMaria della Scala, and groping to finde his way in the darke, wenton so farre as the Sisters of Ripole, commonly called the VirginSanctuary. Not farre off from thence, were divers trenches andditches, wherein such men as are imployed in necessarynightservices, used to empty the Countesse di Cimillari, and afterwardimployed it for manuring Husbandmens grounds. Buffalmaco, being comeneere one of them, he stayed to breath himselfe awhile, and thencatching fast hold on one of the Doctours feete, raysed him somewhathigher on his back, for the easier discharging of his burthen, andso pitched him (with his head forwardes) into the Laystall.

　　Then began he to make a dreadful kinde of noise, stamping andtrampling with his feete, passing backe againe to Santa Maria dellaScala, and to Prato d'Ognissanti, where hee met with Bruno, who wasconstrained to forsake him, because he could not refraine from lowdeLaughter, then both together went backe once more, to see how thePhysitian would behave himselfe, being so sweetely embrued.

　　Master Doctor, seeing himselfe to bee in such an abhominablestinking place, laboured with all his utmost endevour, to gethimself released thence: but the more he contended and strove forgetting forth, he plunged himselfe the further in, being mostpitifully myred from head to foot, sighing and sorrowingextraordinarily, because much of the foule water entred in at hismouth. In the end, being forced to leave his hood behinde him,scrambling both with his hands and feet, he got landing out of hisstinking Labyrinth, and having no other means, home he returned to hisown house, where knocking at the door he was at length admittedentrance. The doore being scarse made fast againe after his lettingin, Buffalmaco and Bruno were there arrived, listning how M. Doctorshould bee welcomd home by his angry wife: who scolding and railing athim with wonderfull impatience, gave him most hard and bitterspeeches, terming him the vilest man living.

　　Where have you bin Sir? quoth she. Are you becom a night-walkerafter other Women? And could no worse garments serve your turne, butyour Doctors gown of Scarlet? Am I to suffer this behaviour? Or am notI sufficient to content you, but you must be longing after change? Iwould thou hadst bin stifled in that foule filth, where thy foulerlife did justly cast thee. Behold goodly Master Doctor of theLeystall, who being maried to an honest woman must yet go abroad inthe night time, insatiatly lusting after whores and harlots. Withthese and the like intemperate speeches, she ceased not to afflict andtorment him, till the night was almost spent, and the Doctor broughtinto a sweeter savour.

　　The next morning, Bruno and Buffalmaco, colourd their bodyes witha strange kinde of painting, resembling blisters, swellings, andbruises, as if they had bin extreamly beaten; came to the Physitianshouse, finding him to be newly up, al the house yet smelling of hisfoule savour (although it had bin very well perfumed) and beingadmitted to him in the Garden, hee welcommed them with the morningssalutations. But Bruno and Buffalmaco (being otherwise provided forhim) delivering stearne and angry lookes, stamping and chafing,Bruno thus replyed.

　　Never speake so faire and flattering to us, for we are movedbeyond all compasse of patience. All misfortunes in the worlde fallupon you, and an evill death may you dye, like the most false andperfidious Traitor living on the earth. We must beate our braines, andmove all our most endeared friends, onely for your honor andadvancement: while wee were well neere starved to death in the coldlike Dogs, and, by your breach of promise, have bin this night soextreamly beaten, as if (like Asses) we should have beene driven toRome.

　　But that which is most greevous of all, is danger of excluding outof the Society, where wee tooke good order for your admittance, andfor your most honourable entertainment. If you wi not credit us,behold our bodies, and let your owne eyes be witnesses, in what cruellmanner we have bin beaten. So taking him aside under the Gallery,where they might not be discovered by overmuch light, they openedtheir bosomes, shewing him their painted bodies, and sodainly closedthem up againe.

　　The Physitian laboured to excuse himselfe, declaring his misfortunesat large, and into what a filthy place he was throwne. It maketh nomatter (answered Buffalmaco) I would you had bin throwen from offthe Bridge into Arno, where you might have beene recommended to theDivell and all his Saints. Did not I tell you so much before. Ingood sadnesse (quoth the Doctor) I neyther commended my selfe toGod, nor any of his Saints. How? sayde Buffalmaco, I am sure youwill not maintaine an untruth, you used a kind of recommendation:for our messenger told us, that you talked of God, S. Dominicke, andyour good Angell, whom you desired to assist you, being soaffrighted with feare, that you trembled like a leafe upon a tree, notknowing indeede where you were. Thus have you unfaithfully dealtwith us, as never any man shall doe the like againe, in seekinghonour, and losing it through your own negligence.

　　Master Doctor humbly entreated pardon, and that they would notrevile him any more, labouring to appease them by the best words hecould use, as fearing least they should publish this great disgrace ofhim. And whereas (before) he gave them gracious welcomes; now heredoubled them with farre greater courtesies, feasting them daily athis own table, and evermore delighting in their company. Thus (asyou have heard) two poore Painters of Florence, taught Master Doctorbetter Wit, then all the Learned at Bologna.

　　THE EIGHT DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREBY APPEARETH, THAT SUCH AS MEET WITH CUNNING HARLOTS, AND

　　SUFFER THEMSELVES TO BE DECEIVED BY THEM: MUST SHARPEN THEIR WITS,

　　TO MAKE THEM REQUITALL IN THE SELFESAME KINDE

　　A Cicilian Courtezane, named Madame Biancafiore, by her craftiewit and policie, deceived a young Merchant, called Salabetto, of allthe money he had taken for his Wares at Palermo. Afterward, hemaking shew of comming hither againe, with farre richer Merchandisesthen hee brought before: made the meanes to borrow a great summe ofMoney of her, leaving her so base a pawne, as well requited her forher former cozenage.

　　Needlesse it were to question, whether the Novell related by theQueene, in divers passages thereof, mooved the Ladies to heartylaughter, and likewise to compassionate sighes and teares; as pittyingMadame Helena in her hard misfortune, and yet applauding theScholler for his just revenge. But the discourse being ended, Dioneus,who knew it was his Office to be the last speaker every day, aftersilence was commanded, he began in this manner.

　　Worthy Ladies, it is a matter very manifest, that deceits do appeareso much the more pleasing, when (by the selfesame meanes) the subtledeceyver is artificially deceived. In which respect, though you allhave reported very singular deceits: yet I meane to tel you one,that may prove as pleasing to you, as any of your owne. And so muchthe rather, because the woman deceived, was a great and cunningMistris in beguiling others; equalling (if not excelling) any ofyour former beguilers.

　　It hath bene observed heretofore, and (happily) at this very dayit is as frequent, that in all Cities and Townes upon the Seacoasts,having Ports for the benefit and venting Merchandises; Merchants useto bring their wealthy laden Vessels thither. And when they unlade anyShip of great fraught, there are prepared Store-houses, which inmany places are called Magazines or Doganaes, at the charge of theCommunalty, or Lord of the Towne or City, for the use whereof, theyreceive yearly gain and benefit. Into those warehouses, they deliver(under writing, and to the owners of them in especiall charge) alltheir goods and merchandises, of what price or valew soever they are.

　　Such as be the Owners of these Magazines, when the Wares are thusstored uppe in them, doe safely locke them up there with theirkeyes, having first registred downe truly all the goods, in theRegister belonging to the Custome-house, that the Merchant may havea just account rendred him, and the rights payed to theCustomehouse, according to the Register, and as they are either inpart, or in all made sale of.

　　Brokers are continually there attending, being informed in thequality of the Merchandises stored, and likewise to what Merchantsthey appertaine: by meanes of these men, and according as the goodscome to their hands, they devise to have them exchaunged, trucked,vented, and such other kinds of dispatches, answerable to the mensminds, and worth of the Commodities. As in many other Kingdomes andCountries, so was this custome observed at Palermo in Sicily, wherelikewise then were, and (no doubt) now adayes are, store of Women,faire and comely of person, but yet vowed enemies to honesty.

　　Neverthelesse, by such as know them not, they are held and reputedto be blamelesse Women, and by yeilding their bodyes unto generalluse, are the occasion of infinite misfortunes to men. For so sooneas they espy a Merchant-stranger there arrived, they win informationfrom the Booke belonging to the Magazin, what wares are thereinstored, of what valew they bee, and who is the Owner of them.Afterwards, by amorous actions, and affable speeches, they allure yongMerchants to take knowledge of them, to bee familiar in their company,till from some they get most part of their wealth, from others all.Nay, divers have gone so farre, as to make Port-sale of Ship, Goods,and Person, so cunningly they have bene shaven by these Barbers, andyet without any Razor.

　　It came to passe, and no long time since, that a young Florentine ofours, named Niccolo de Cignano, but more usually called Salabetto,imployed as Factor for his Maister, arrived at Palermo; his Shipstored with many Woollen Cloathes, a remainder of such as had bin soldat the Mart of Salerno; amounting in valew to above five hundredFlorines of Gold. When he had given in his packet to theCustome-house, and made them up safe in his Warehouse; withoutmaking shew of desiring any speedy dispatch, he delighted to viewall parts of the City, as mens minds are continuallie addicted toNovelties. He being a very faire and affable yong man, easie to kindleaffection in a very modest eie: it fortuned, that a Courtezane, one ofour before remembred shavers, who termed hir selfe Madame Biancafiore,having heard somewhat concerning his affairs, beganne to dartamorous glances at him. Which the indiscreete youth perceyving, andthinking her to be some great Lady: began also to grow halfeperswaded, that his comely person was pleasing to her and therefore hewould carrie this good fortune of his somewhat cautelously.

　　Without imparting his mind unto any one, he would daily passe tooand fro before her doore; which she observing, and havingindifferently wounded him with her wanton piercing lookes: she beganto use the first tricke of her Trade, by pretending her enflamedaffection towards him, which made her pine and consume away in care,except he might be moved to pitty her. Whereupon, she sent one ofher Pandoraes unto him, perfectly instructed in the Art of aMaquerella, who (after many cunning counterfetted sighes, andteares, which she had alwayes ready at command) told him that hiscomely person and compleate perfections, had so wounded the very souleof her Mistresse, as she could enjoy no rest in any place, either byday or night. In regard whereof, she desired (above all things else)to meete with him privately in a Bathe: with which Wordes, shestraightway tooke a Ring forth of her pursse, and in most humblemanner, delivered it unto him, as a token from her Mistresse.

　　Salabetto having heard this Message, was the onely joyfull manthat could be: and having receyved the Ring, looking on itadvisedly; first kissed it, and then put it upon his finger. Then inanswer to the Messenger, he sayd: That if her Mistresse Biancafioreaffected him, she sustained no losse thereby, in regard he loved heras fervently, and was ready to be commanded by her, at any timewhensoever she pleased.

　　She having delivered this message to her Mistresse, was presentlyreturned backe againe to him, to let him understand, in which of theBathes she meant to meet him, on the next morrow in the evening.This being counsell for himselfe onely to keepe, he imparted it not toany friend whatsoever; but when the houre for their meeting wascome, he went unto the place where he was appointed, a Bathe(belike) best agreeing with such businesse.

　　Not long had he taried there, but two Women slaves came laden tohim, the one bearing a Mattresse of fine Fustian on hir head, andthe other a great Basket filled with many things. Having spred theMattresse in a faire Chamber on a Couch-bed, they covered it withdelicate white Linnen sheets, all about embroidred with faireFringes of gold, then laid they on costly quilts of rich Silkes,artificially wrought with gold and silver knots, having pearles andprecious stones interwoven among them, and two such rich pillowes,as sildome before had the like bin seene. Salabetto putting off hisgarments, entred the Bath prepared for him, where the two Slaveswashed his body very neatly. Soone after came Biancafiore hirselfe,attended on by two other women slaves, and seeing Salabetto in theBathe; making him a lowly reverence, breathing forth infinitedissembled sighes, and teares trickling downe her cheekes, kissing andembracing him, thus she spake.

　　I know not what man else in the worlde, beside thy selfe, could havethe power to bring me hither: the fire flew from thy faire eies (Othou incompareable lovely Tuscane) that melted my soule, and makesme onely live at thy command. Then hurling off her light wearinggarment (because she came prepared for the purpose) shee stept intothe bathe to him, and, not permitting the Slaves a-while to comeneere, none but her selfe must now lave his body, with Muskecompounded Sope and Gilly-floures. Afterward, the slaves washed bothhim and her, bringing two goodly sheetes, softe and white, yeeldingsuch a delicate smell of Roses, even as if they had bene made ofRose-leaves. In the one, they folded Salabetto, and her in theother, and so conveyed them on their shoulders unto the preparedBed-Couch, where because they should not sweate any longer, they tookethe sheets from about them, and laid them gently in the bed.

　　Then they opened the Basket, wherein were divers goodly Silverbottles, some filled with Rosewaters, others with flowers ofOrenges, and Waters distilled of Gelsomine, Muske, and Amber-Greece,wherewith (againe) the slaves bathed their bodyes in the bed, andafterward presented them with variety of Comfites, as also veryprecious Wines, serving them in stead of a little Collation. Salabettosupposed himself to be in Paradise: for this appeared to be no earthlyjoy, bestowing a thousand gladsome gazes on her, who (questionlesse)was a most beautifull creature, and the tarrying of the Slaves, seemedmillions of yeares to him, that hee might more freely embrace hisBiancafiore. Leaving a Waxe Taper lighted in the Chamber, the slavesdeparted, and then shee sweetly embracing Salabetto, bestowed thosefurther favours on him, which hee came for, and she was notsqueamish in the affoording; wherof he was exceedingly joyfull,because he imagined, that they proceeded from the integrity of heraffection towards him.

　　When she thought it convenient time to depart thence, the slavesreturned; they cloathed themselves, and had a Banquet standing readyprepared for them; wherewith they cheared their wearyed spirits, afterthey had first washed in odorifferous waters. At parting: Salabetto(quoth she) whensoever thy leysures shal best serve thee, I willrepute it as my cheefest happinesse, that thou wilt accept a Supperand Lodging in my house, which let it be this instant night, if thoucanst. He being absolutely caught, both by hir beauty and flatteringbehaviour: beleeved faithfully, that he was as intirely beloved ofher, as the heart is of the body: whereuppon hee thus answered.Madame, whatsoever pleaseth you, must needes be much more acceptableunto mee: and therefore, not onely may command my service thisnight, but likewise the whole employment of my life, to be onely yoursin my very best studies and endeavours.

　　No sooner did she heare this answer, but she returned home to herowne house, which she decked in most sumptuous maner, and also madeready a costly Supper, expecting the arrivall of Salabetto: who whenthe darke night was indifferently well entred, went thither, and waswelcommed with wonderfull kindnesse, wanting no costly Wines andDelicates all the Supper while. Being afterward conducted into agoodly Chamber, he smelt there admirable sweete senting savours,such as might well beseeme a Princes Pallace. He beheld a mostcostly Bed, and very rich furniture round about the roome: whichwhen he had duly considered to himself, he was constantly perswaded,that she was a Lady of infinit wealth. And although he had hearddivers flying reports concerning her life, yet hee would not crediteany thing amisse of her, for albeit she might (perhappes) beguile someother; yet shee affected him (he thought) in better manner, and nosuch misfortune could happen to him.

　　Having spent all the night with her in wanton dalliances, andbeing risen in the morning; to enflame his affection more and moretowards her, and to prevent any ill opinion he might conceyve ofher, she bestowed a rich and costly Girdle on him, as also a purssemost curiously wrought, saying to him. My sweet Salabetto, withthese testimonies of my true affection to thee, I give thee faithfullyto understand, that as my person is onely subjected thine; so thishouse and all the riches in it, remaineth absolutely at thydisposition, or whatsoever hereafter shal happen within the compasseof my power.

　　He being not a little proud of this her bountifull offer (havingnever bestowed any gift on her, because by no meanes shee wouldadmit it) after many sweet kisses and embraces; departed thence, tothe place where the Merchants usually frequented: resorting to her(from time to time) as occasion served, and paying not one single penyfor all his wanton pleasure, by which cunning baytes (at length) shecaught him.

　　It came to passe, that having made sale of all his Clothes,whereby hee had great gaines, and the moneyes justly payed him atthe times appointed: Biancafiore got intelligence thereof; yet notby him, but from one of the Brokers. Salabetto comming one night tosup with her, she embraced and kissed him as she was wont to doe,and seemed so wonderfully addicted in love to him, even as if sheewould have dyed with delight in his armes. Instantly, shee would needsbestow two goodly gilt standing Cuppes on him, which Salabetto by nomeanes would receive, because she had formerly bin very bountifullto him, to above the value of an hundred Crowns, and yet she would nottake of him so much as a mite. At length, pressing still more tokensof her love and bounty on him, which he as courteously denied, asshe kindly offered: one of her Women-slaves (as shee had beforecunningly appointed) sodainely calling her, forthwith she departed outof her Chamber. And when she had continued a pretty while absent,she returned againe weeping, and throwing her selfe downe upon herPallet, breathed forth such sighes and wofull lamentations, as noWoman could possibly doe the like.

　　Salabetto amazedly wondering thereat, tooke her in his Armes, andweeping also with her, said. Alas my deare Love, what sodainaccident hath befalne you, to urge this lamentable alteration? Ifyou love me, hide it not from me. After he had of entreated her inthis manner, casting her armes about his necke, and sighing as ifher heart would breake, thus she replyed. Ah Salabetto, the onelyjewell of my joy on earth, I knowe not what to do, or say, for (evennow) I received Letters from Messina, wherein my Brother writes to me,that although it cost the sale of all my goods, or whatsoever else Ihave beside, I must (within eight dayes space) not faile to send him athousand Florins of gold, or else he must have his head smitten off,and I know not by what meanes to procure them so soone. For, if thelimitation of fifteene dayes might serve the turne, I could borrowthem in a place, where I can command a farre greater summe, or elseI would sell some part of our Lands. But beeing no way able tofurnish him so soone, I would I had died before I heard thesedismall tydings. And in the uttering of these words, she graced themwith such cunning dissembled sorrow, as if she had meant truly indeed.Salabetto, in whom the fury of his amorous flames, had consumed agreat part of his necessary understanding, beleeving thesecounterfetted tears and complaints of hers, to proceed from anhonest meaning soule; rashly and foolishly thus replied. DeareBiancafiore, I cannot furnish you with a thousand golden Florines, butam able to lend you five hundred if I were sure of their repaymentat fifteene dayes, wherein you are highly beholding to Fortune, that Ihave made sale of all my Cloathes; which if they had lyen still onmy hand, my power could not stretch to lend you five Florines. Alasdeare heart (quoth she) would you be in such want of money, and hideit from her that loves you so loyally? Why did you not make yourneed knowne to me? Although I am not furnished of a thousand Florines;yet I have alwaies ready three or foure hundred by me, to do any kindeoffice for my friend. In thus wronging me, you have robd me of allboldnes, to presume upon your offer made me. Salabetto, far fasterinveigled by these words then before, said. Let not my folly (brightBiancafiore) cause you to refuse my friendly offer, in such a caseof extreme necessity: I have them ready pre. pared for you, and amheartily sory, that my power cannot furnish you with the whole summe.

　　Then catching him fast in her armes, thus she answered. Now Iplainly perceive, my dearest Salabetto, that the love thou bearestme is true and perfect; when, without expectation of beingrequested, thou art readie to succour me in such an urgent neede,and with so faire a summe of Florines. Sufficiently was I thine ownebefore, but now am much more ingaged by so high deserving; with thisparticular acknowledgement for ever, that my Brothers head wasredeemed by thy goodnesse onely. Heaven beareth me record, howunwilling I am to be beholding in this kind, considring that you are aMerchant, and Merchants furnish al their affairs with ready monis: butseeing necessity constraineth me, and I make no doubt of repaimentat the time appointed: I . p shall the more boldly accept yourkindnes, with this absolute promise beside, that I wil rather sell allthe houses I have, then breake my honest word with you.

　　Counterfeit teares still drayning downe her cheeks, and Salabettokindly comforting her; he continued there with hir all that night,to expresse him selfe her most liberall servant. And, withoutexpecting any more requesting, the next morning he brought her thefive hundred Florines, which she received with a laughing heart, butoutward dissembled weeping eies; Salabetto never demanding any othersecurity, but onely her single promise.

　　Biancafiore, having thus received the five hundred Florines, theindiction of the Almanacke began to alter: and whereas (before)Salabetto could come see her whensoever he pleased, many occasions nowhappened, whereby he came seven times for once, and yet his entrancewas scarsely admitted, neither was his entertainment so affable, orhis cheare so bountifull, as in his former accesses thither. Moreover,when the time for repaiment was come, yea a moneth or two over-past,and he demanded to have his money; hee could have nothing but wordsfor paiment. Now he began to consider on the craft and cunning of thiswicked Woman, as also his owne shallow understanding, knowing he couldmake no proofe of his debt, but what her selfe listed to say, havingneither witnes, specialty, bill or bond to shew: which made hisfolly so shamefull to him, that he durst not complaine to anyperson, because he had received some advertisements before, whereto hewold by no means listen, and now should have no other amends, butpublike infamie, scorne and disgrace, which made him almost weary ofhis life, and much to bemoane his owne unhappinesse. He receivedalso divers Letters from his Master, to make returne of the 500Florines over by way of banke, according as he had used to do: butnowe could performe no such matter.

　　Hereupon, because his error should not be discovered, he departed ina small vessell thence, not making for Pisa, as he should have done,but directly for Naples hee shaped his course. At that instantlodged there, Don Pietro della Canigiano, Treasurer of the Empresse ofConstantinople, a man of great wisedome and understanding, as alsovery ingenious and politike, he being an especiall Favourer ofSalabetto and all his friendes, which made him presume the more boldly(being urged thereto by meere necessity, the best corrector ofwandering wits) to acquaint him with his lamentable misfortune, inevery particular as it had hapned, requesting his aid and advice,how he might best weare out the rest of his dayes, because hee nevermeant to visit Florence any more.

　　Canigiano being much displeased at the repetition of his Follie,sharply reproved him, saying. Thou hast done leudly, in carying thyselfe so loosely, and spending thy Masters goods so carelesly, whichthough I cannot truly tearme spent, but rather art meerely cousenedand cheated of them, yet thou seest at what a deere rate thou hastpurchased pleasure, which yet is not utterly helplesse, but may by onemeanes or other be recovered. And being a man of woonderfullapprehension, advised him instantly what was to bee done, furnishinghim also with a summe of money, wherewith to adventure a second losse,in hope of recovering the first againe: he caused divers Packes tobe well bound up, with the Merchants markes orderly made on them,and bought about twenty Buttes or Barrelles, all filled (as it were)with Oyle, and these pretended commodities being shipt, Salabettoreturned with them to Palermo. Where having given in his packets tothe Customehouse, and entred them all under his owne name, as beingboth owner and factor: all his Wares were lockt up in his Magizine,with open publication, that he would not vent any of them, beforeother merchandises (which he daily expected) were there also arrived.

　　Biancafiore having heard thereof, and understanding withall, that hehad brought Merchandises now with him, amounting to above two thousandFlorins, staying also in expectation of other commodities, valewingbetter then three thousand more, she beganne to consider with herselfe, that she had not yet gotten money enough from him, andtherefore would cast a figure for a farre bigger booty. Which that shemight the more fairely effect, without so much as an imagination ofthe least mistrust: she would repay him backe his five hundredFlorines, to winne from him a larger portion of two or threethousand at the least, and having thus setled her determination, shesent to have him come speake with her. Salabetto, having benesoundly bitten before, and therefore the better warranted from thelike ranckling teeth, willingly went to her, not shewing any signeof former discontent: and she, seeming as if she knew nothing of thewealth he brought with him, gracing him in as loving manner as evershe had done, thus she spake.

　　I am sure Salabetto, you are angry with mee, because I restorednot your Florines at my promised day. Salabetto smiling, presentlyanswered. Beleeve me Lady (quoth he) it did a little distast me,even as I could have bin offended with him, that should plucke outmy heart to bestow it on you, if it would yeelde you anycontentment. But to let you know unfainedly, how much I am incensedwith anger against you: such and so great is the affection I beareyou, that I have solde the better part of my whole estate,converting the same into Wealthy Merchandises, which I have alreadiebrought hither with mee, and valewing above two thousand Florines, allwhich are stored up in my Magazine. There must they remaine, tillanother Ship come forth of the Westerne parts, wherein I have a muchgreater adventure, amounting unto more then three thousand Florines.And my purpose is, to make my aboade heere in this City, which hathwon the sole possession of my heart, onely in regard of myBiancafiore, to whom I am so intirely devoted, as both my selfe, andwhatsoever else is mine (now or hereafter) is dedicated onely to herservice; whereto thus she replyed.

　　Now trust me Salabetto, whatsoever redoundeth to thy good andbenefite, is the cheefest comfort of my soule, in regard I prize thylove dearer then mine owne life, and am most joyfull of thy returnehither againe; but much more of thy still abiding heere, because Iintend to live onely with thee, so soone as I have taken order forsome businesse of import. In the meane while, let me entreate theeto hold me excused, because before thy departure hence, thou camestsometimes to see me, without thy entrance admitted; and other-whilesagaine, found not such entertainement, as formerly had bene affoorded.But indeede, and above all the rest, in not re-paying thy moneyaccording to my promise. But consider good Salabetto, in what greattrouble and affliction of minde I then was, both in regard of myBrothers danger, and other important occurrences beside, whichmollestations do much distract the senses, and hinder kindecourtesies, which otherwise would bee extended liberally.

　　Last of all consider also, how difficult a thing it is for awoman, so sodainly to raise the summe of a thousand golden Florines,when one friend promiseth, and performeth not; another protesteth, yethath no such meaning; a third sweareth, and yet proveth a falseLyar: so that by being thus ungently used, a breach is made betweenethe best frends living. From hence it proceeded, and no other defectelse, that I made not due returne of your five hundred Florins. Nosooner were you departed her but I had them readie, and as manymore, and could I have knowne whither to send them, they had bene withyou long time since, which because I could not (by any meanes)compasse, I kept them still for you in continuall readinesse, ashoping of your comming hither againe. So causing a purse to bebrought, wherein the same Florines were, which hee had deliveredher; she gave it into his hand, and prayed him to count them over,whether there were so many, or no.

　　Never was Salabettoes heart halfe so joyfull before; and havingcounted them, found them to be his owne five hundred Florines: then,putting them up into his pocket, he saide. Comfort of my life, Fullwell I know that whatsoever you have saide, is most certaine; butlet us talke no more of falshood in friendship, or casuall accidentshappening unexpected: you have dealt with mee like a most loyallMistresse, and heere I protest unfainedly to you, that as well inrespect of this kinde courtesie, as also the constancy of mineaffection to you, you cannot request hereafter a far greater summeof me, to supply any necessarie occasion of yours; but (if my powercan performe it) you shall assuredly finde it certaine: make proofethereof whensoever you please, after my other goods are Landed, andI have established my estate here in your City.

　　Having in this manner renewed his wonted amity with her, and withwords farre enough off from all further meaning: Salabetto beganagaine to frequent her company, she expressing all former familiarity,shewing her selfe as lavishly bountifull to him, in all respects asbefore she had done, nay, many times in more magnificent manner.

　　But he intending to punish her notorious trechery towards him,when she left him as an open scorne to the World, wounded withdisgrace, and quite out of credit with all his friends: she having (ona day) solemnly invited him, to suppe and lodge in her house allnight; he went, both with sad and melancholly lookes, seeming asovercome with extreamity of sorrow. Biancafiore mervayling at thisstrange alteration in him, sweetly kissing and embracing him: wouldneeds know the reason of his passionate affliction, and hepermitting her to urge the question oftentimes together, withoutreturning any direct answere; to quit her in her kind, and withcoine of her owne stampe, after a few dissembled sighes, he began inthis manner.

　　Ah my dearest Love, I am utterly undone, because the Shippecontaining the rest of mine expected Merchandises, is taken by thePyrates of Monago, and put to the ransome of tenne thousand Florinesof Gold, and my part particularly, is to pay one thousand. At thisinstant I am utterly destitute of money, because the five hundredFlorines which I received of you, I sent hence the next daie followingto Naples, to buy more cloathes, which likewise are to be sent hither.And if I should now make sale of the Merchandizes in my Magazine(the time of generall utterance being not yet come) I shall not make apennyworth for a penny. And my misfortune is the greater, because I amnot so well knowne heere in your City, as to find some succour in suchan important distresse; wherfore I know not what to do or say.Moreover, if the money be not speedily sent, our goods will be carriedinto Monago, and then they are past all redemption utterly.

　　Biancafiore appearing greatly discontented, as one verily perswaded,that this pretended losse was rather hers, then his, because she aymedat the mainest part of all his wealth: began to consider with herselfe, which was the likeliest course to bee taken, for saving thegoods from carriage to Monago: wherupon thus she replied. Heavenknoweth (my dearest Salabetto) how thy love maketh me sorrowfull forthis misfortune, and it greeveth me to see thee any way distressed:for if I had mony lying by mee (as many times I have) thou shouldstfinde succour from my selfe onely, but indeede I am not able tohelpe thee. True it is, there is a friend of mine, who did lend mefive hundred Florines in my need, to make uppe the other summe which Iborrowed of thee: but he demandeth extreme interest, because he willnot abate any thing of thirty in the hundred, and if you should beeforced to use him, you must give him some good security. Now for mypart, the most of my goods here I will pawne for thee: but what pledgecan you deliver in to make up the rest? Wel did Salabetto conceive theoccasion why she urged this motion, and was so diligent in doing himsuch a pleasure: for it appeared evidently to him, that her selfewas to lend the mony, wherof he was not a litle joyful, seeming verythankful to hir. Then he told her, that being driven to suchextremity, how unreasonable soever the usury was, yet he wouldgladly pay for it. And for her Friends further security, hee wouldpawne him all the goods in his Magazine, entering them downe in thename of the party, who lent the money. Onely he desired to keepe theKeyes of the Ware-house, as well to shew his Merchandises, when anyMerchant shot bee so desirous: as also to preserve them from illusing, transporting or changing, before his redemption of them.

　　She found no fault with his honest offer, but sayde, hee shewedhimselfe a well-meaning man, and the next morning shee sent for aBroker, in whom she reposed especiall trust; and after they hadprivately consulted together, shee delivered him a thousand GoldenFlorines, which were caried by him presently to Salabetto, and theBond made in the Brokers name, of all the goods remaining inSalabettoes ware-house, with composition and absolute agreement, forthe prefixed time of the monies repaiment. No sooner was this trickefully accomplished, but Salabetto seeming as if he went to redeeme histaken goods: set saile for Naples towards Pietro della Canigiano, withfifteene hundred Florines of Gold: from whence also he sentcontentment to his Master at Florence (who imployd him as his Factorat Palermo) beside his owne packes of Cloathes. He made repaymentlikewise to Canigiano, for the monies which furnished him in this lastvoyage, and any other to whom hee was indebted. So there he stayedawhile with Canigiano, whose counsel thus holpe him to out-reach theSicillian Courtezane: and meaning to deale in Merchandise no more,afterward he returned to Florence and there lived in good reputation.

　　Now as concerning Biancafiore, when she saw that Salabettoreturned not againe to Palermo, she beganne to grow somewhatabashed, as halfe suspecting that which followed. After she hadtarried for him above two moneths space, and perceived hee came not,nor any tydings heard of him: shee caused the Broker to breake openthe Magazine, casting forth the Buttes or Barrels, which shee beleevedto bee full of good Oyles. But they were all filled with Seawater,each of them having a small quantity of Oyle floating on the toppe,onely to serve when a tryall should bee made. And then unbinding thePackes, made up in formall and Merchantable manner: there wasnothing else in them, but Logges and stumpes of Trees, wrapthandsomely in hurdles of Hempe and Tow; onely two had Cloathes inthem. So that (to bee briefe) the whole did not value two hundredCrownes: which when she saw, and observed how cunningly she wasdeceived: a long while after shee sorrowed, for repaying backe thefive hundred Florines, and folly in lending a thousand more, usingit as a Proverbe alwaies after to hit selfe: That whosoever dealt witha Tuscane, had neede to have sound sight and judgement. So remainingcontented (whither she would or no) with her losse: she plainlyperceyved, that although she lived by cheating others, yet now atthe length she had mette with her match.

　　So soone as Dioneus had ended his Novell, Madame Lauretta also knew,that the conclusion of her Regiment was come; whereupon, when thecounsell of Canigiano had past with generall commendation, and the witof Salabetto no lesse applauded, for fitting it with such aneffectuall prosecution; shee tooke the Crowne of Laurell from her ownehead, and set it upon Madame Aimilliaes, speaking graciously in thismanner. Madam, I am not able to say, how pleasant a Queene we shallhave of you, but sure I am, that we shall enjoy a faire one: letmatters therefore be so honourably ca.rried; that your governmentmay be answerable to your beautifull perfections; which words wereno sooner delivered, but she sate downe in her mounted seate.

　　Madame Aemillia being somewhat bashfull, not so much of hir beingcreated Queene, as to heare her selfe thus publikely praysed, withthat which Women do most of all desire: her face then appearing,like the opening of the Damaske Rose, in the goodlyest morning. Butafter she had a while dejected her lookes, and the Vermillion blushwas vanished away: having taken order with the Master of the houshold,for all needefull occasions befitting the assembly, thus she began.

　　Gracious Ladies, wee behold it daily, that those Oxen which havelaboured in the yoake most part of the day, for their moreconvenient feeding, are let forth at liberty, and permitted towander abroad in the Woods. We see moreover, that Gardens andOrchards, being planted with variety of the fairest fruit Trees, areequalled in beauty by Woods and Forrests, in the plentifull enjoyingof as goodly spreading branches. In consideration whereof,remembring how many dayes wee have already spent (under theseveritie of Lawes imposed) shaping all our discourses to a forme ofobservation: I am of opinion, that it will not onely well become us,but also prove beneficiall for us, to live no longer under suchrestraint, and like enthralled people, desirous of liberty, wee shouldno more be subjected to the yoke, but recover our former strength inwalking freely.

　　Wherefore, concerning our pastime purposed for to morrow, I am notminded to use any restriction, or tye you unto any particularordination: but rather do liberally graunt, that every one shalldevise and speake of arguments agreeing with your owne dispositions.

　　Besides, I am verily perswaded, that variety of matter uttered sofreely, will be much more delightfull, then restraint to one kindeof purpose onely. Which being thus granted by me, whosoever shalsucceede me in the government, may (as being of more power andpreheminence) restraine all backe againe to the accustomed lawes.And having thus spoken, she dispensed with their any longerattendance, untill it should be Supper time.

　　Every one commended the Queenes appointment, allowing it torellish of good wit and judgement: and being all risen, fell to suchexercises as they pleased. The Ladies made Nosegaies and Chaplets ofFlowers, the men played on their Instruments, singing divers sweeteDitties to them, and thus were busied untill Supper time. Which beeingcome, and they supping about the beautifull Fountaine: after Supper,they fell to singing and dauncing. In the end, the Queene, toimitate the order of her predecessors, commanded Pamphilus, thatnotwithstanding all the excellent songs formerly sung: he should nowsing one, whereunto dutifully obeying, thus he began.

　　THE SONG

　　THE CHORUS SUNG BY ALL

　　Love, I found such felicitie,

　　And joy, in thy captivitie:

　　As I before did never prove,

　　And thought me happy, being in Love.

　　Comfort abounding in my hart,

　　Joy and Delight

　　In soule and spright

　　I did possesse in every part;

　　O Soveraigne Love by thee.

　　Thy Sacred fires,

　　Fed my desires,

　　And still aspires,

　　Thy happy thrall to bee.

　　Love, I found such felicity, etc.

　　My Song wants power to relate,

　　The sweets of minde

　　Which I did finde

　　In that most blissefull state,

　　O Soveraigne Love by thee.

　　No sad despaire,

　　Or killing care

　　Could me prepare;

　　Still thou didst comfort me.

　　Love, I found such felicity, etc.

　　I hate all such as do complaine,

　　Blaspheming thee

　　With Cruelty,

　　And sleights of coy disdaine.

　　O So raigne Love, to mee

　　Thou has bene kinde:

　　If others finde

　　Thee worse inclinde,

　　Yet I will honour thee.

　　Love, I found such felicitie,

　　And joy in thy Captivitie:

　　As I before did never prove,

　　But thought me happie, being in Love.

　　Thus the Song of Pamphilus ended, whereto all the rest (as a Chorus)answered with their Voyces, yet every one particularly (according asthey felt their Love-sicke passions) made a curious constructionthereof, perhaps more then they needed, yet not Divining whatPamphilus intended. And although they were transported with variety ofimaginations; yet none of them could arive at his true meaning indeed.Wherefore the Queene, perceiving the Song to be fully ended, and theLadies, as also the young Gentlemen, willing to go take their rest:she commaunded them severally to their Chambers.

　　THE INDUCTION TO THE NINTH DAY

　　WHEREON, UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF MADAME AIMILIA, THE ARGUMENT OF

　　EACH SEVERALL DESCOURSE, IS NOT LIMITTED TO ANY ONE PECULIAR

　　SUBJECT: BUT EVERY ONE REMAINETH AT LIBERTY, TO

　　SPEAK OF WHATSOEVER THEMSELVES BEST PLEASETH

　　Faire Aurora, from whose bright and chearefull lookes, the duskiedarke night flyeth as an utter enemy, had already reached so high asthe eight Heaven, converting it all into an Azure colour, and thepretty Flowrets beganne to spred open their Leaves: when MadameAemillia, beeing risen, caused all her female attendants, and the yongGentlemen likewise, to be summoned for. their personall appearance.Who being all come, the Queen leading the way, and they followingher Majesticke pace, walked into a little Wood, not farre offdistant from the Palace.

　　Where the Queen, looking on Madam Philomena, gave her the honor ofbeginning the first Novell for that day: whereto shee dutifullycondiscending, began as followeth.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　APPROVING, THAT CHASTE AND HONEST WOMEN, OUGHT RATHER TO DENY

　　IMPORTUNATE SUITERS, BY SUBTILE AND INGENIOUS MEANES,

　　THEN FALL OF SCANDALL AND SLANDER

　　Madame Francesca, a Widdow of Pistoya, being affected by twoFlorentine Gentlemen, the one named Rinuccio Palermini, and theother Alessandro Chiarmontesi, and she bearing no good will toeyther of them; ingeniously freed her selfe from both theirimportunate suites. One of them she caused to lye as dead in agrave, and the other to fetch him from thence: so neither of themaccomplishing what they were enjoyned, fayled of obtaining his hopedexpectation.

　　Madame, it can no way discontent mee (seeing it is your mostgracious pleasure) that I should have the honour, to breake thefirst staffe of freedome in this faire company (according to theinjunction of your Majesty) for liberty of our own best likingarguments: wherein I dismay not (if I can speake well enough) but toplease you all as well, as any other that is to follow me. Nor am I sooblivious (worthy Ladies) but full well I remember, that many timeshath bene related in our passed demonstrations, how mighty andvariable the powers of love are: and yet I cannot be perswaded, thatthey have all bene so sufficiently spoken of, but something may beefurther added, and the bottome of them never dived into, although weshould sit arguing a whole yeare together. And because it hath beenealreadie approved, that Lovers have bene led into divers accidents,not onely inevitable dangers of death, but also have entred into theverie houses of the dead, thence to convey their amorous friends: Ipurpose to acquaint you with a Novell, beside them which have benediscoursed; whereby you may not onely comprehend the power of Love,but also the wisedome used by an honest Gentlewoman, to rid herselfe of two importunate suiters, who loved her against her owneliking, yet neither of them knowing the others affection.

　　In the City of Pistoya, there dwelt sometime a beautifullGentlewoman, being a Widdow, whom two of our Florentines (the onenamed Rinuccio Palermini, and the other Alessandro Chiarmontesi,having withdrawne themselves to Pistoya) desperately affected, the oneignorant of the others intention, but each carrying his caseclosely, as hoping to be possessed of her. This Gentlewoman, namedMadame Francesca de Lazzari, being often solicited by theirmessages, and troublesomely pestered with their importunities: at last(lesse advisedly then she intended) shee granted admittance to heareeither of them speake. Which she repenting, and coveting to be ridof them both, a matter not easie to be done: she wittily devised theonely meanes, namely, to move such a motion to them, as neitherwould willingly undertake, yet within the compasse of possibility; butthey failing in the performance, shee might have the more honestoccasion, to bee free from all further mollestation by them, and herpolitike intention was thus projected.

　　On the same day, when she devised this peece of service, a man wasburied in Pistoya, and in the Church-yard belonging unto the grayFriars, who being descended of good and worthie parentage: yethimselfe was very infamous, and reputed to be the vilest man living,not onely there in Pistoya, but throughout the whole World beside.Moreover, while he lived, he had such a strange mishapen body, and hisface so ugly deformed, that such as knew him not, would stand gastlyaffrighted at the first sight of him. In regarde whereof, sheeconsidered with her selfe, that the foule deformitie of this loathedfellow, would greatly avayle in her determination, and consulting withher Chamber-maid, thus she spake.

　　Thou knowest (my most true and faithfull servant) what trouble andaffliction of minde I suffer dayly, by the messages and Letters of thetwo Florentines, Rinuccio and Alessandro, how hatefull theirimportunity is to me, as being utterly unwilling to hear themspeake, or yeeld to any thing which they desire. Wherefore, to free myselfe from them both together, I have devised (in regard of theirgreat and liberall offers) to make trial of them in such a matter,as I am assured they will never performe.

　　It is not unknowne to thee, that in the Church-yard of the GrayFriars, and this instant morning, Scannadio (for so was the uglyfellow named) was buried; of whom, when he was living, as also nowbeing dead, both men, women, and children, doe yet stand in feare,so gastly and dreadfull alwayes was his personall appearance to them.

　　Wherefore, first of all go thou to Alessandro, and say to himthus. My Mistris Francesca hath sent me to you, to tell you, thatnow the time is come, wherein you may deserve to enjoy her love, andgaine the possession of her person, if you will accomplish such amotion as she maketh to you. For some especiall occasion, wherewithhereafter you shall bee better acquainted, a neere Kinsman of hers,must needs have the body of Scannadio (who was buried this morning)brought to her house. And she, being as much affraid of him now heis dead, as when he was living, by no meanes would have his bodybrought thither.

　　In which respect, as a Token of your unfeigned love to her, andthe latest service you shall ever do for her: shee earnestlyentreateth you, that this night, in the very deadest time thereof, youwould go to the grave, where Scannadio lyeth yet uncovered withearth untill to morrow, and attyring your selfe in his garments,even as if you were the man himselfe, so to remaine there untill herkinsman doe come.

　　Then, without speaking any one word, let him take you foorth ofthe grave, and bring you thence (insted of Scannadio) to hir house:where she will give you gentle welcome, and disappoint her Kinsmanin his hope, by making you Lord of her, and all that is hers, asafterward shall plainly appeare. If he say he wit do it, it is as muchas I desire: but if hee trifle and make deniall, then boldly tell him,that he must refraine all places wheresoever I am, and forbeare tosend me any more Letters, or messages.

　　Having done so, then repaire to Rinuccio Palermini, and say. MyMistresse Francesca is ready to make acceptance of your love;provided, that you will do one thing for her sake. Namely, thisensuing night, in the midst and stillest season thereof, to go tothe grave where Scannadio was this morning buried, and (without makingany noise) or speaking one word, whatsoever you shall heare or see: totake him forth of the grave, and bring him home to her house, wher youshal know the reason of this strange businesse, and enjoy her freelyas your owne for ever. But if he refuse to do it, then I commaund him,never hereafter to see me, or move further suite unto mee, by anymeanes whatsoever.

　　The Chamber-maide went to them both, and delivered the severallmessages from her Mistresse, according as she had given her in charge;whereunto each of them answered, that they woulde (for her sake) notonely descend into a Grave, but also into hell, if it were herpleasure.

　　She returning with this answer unto her Mistresse, Francescaremained in expectation, what the issue of these fond attemptes inthem, would sort unto. When night was come, and the middle hourethereof already past, Alessandro Chiarmontesi, having put off allother garments to his doublet and hose; departed secretly from hislodging, walking towards the Church-yard, where Scannadio lay in hisgrave: but by the way as he went, hee became surprized with diversdreadfull conceites and imaginations, and questioned with himselfethus.

　　What a beast am I? What a businesse have I undertaken? And whitheram I going? What do I know, but that the Kinsman unto this Woman,perhappes understanding mine affection to her, and crediting some suchmatter, as is nothing so: hath laide this politicke traine for me,that he may murther me in the grave? Which (if it should so happen) mylife is lost, and yet the occasion never knowne whereby it was done.Or what know I, whether some secret enemy of mine (affecting her inlike manner, as I do) have devised this stratagem (out of malice)against mee, to draw my life in danger, and further his owne goodFortune? Then, contrary motions, overswaying these suspitions, hequestioned his thoughts in another nature.

　　Let me (quoth he) admit the case, that none of these surmises areintended, but her Kinsman (by and in this manner devised) must bringme into her house: I am not therefore perswaded, that he or they docovet, to have the body of Scannadio, either to carry it thither, orpresent it to her, but rather do aime at some other end. May not Iconjecture, that my close murthering is purposed, and this wayacted, as on him that (in his life time) had offended them? The Maidhath straitly charged me, that whatsoever is said or done unto me, Iam not to speake a word. What if they pul out mine eies, teare outmy teeth, cut off my hands, or do me any other mischiefe: Where am Ithen? Shall all these extremities barre me of speaking? On the otherside, if I speake, then I shall be knowne, and so much the sooner(perhaps) be abused. But admit that I sustaine no injurie at all, asbeing guilty of no transgression: yet (perchance) I shall not becarried to her house, but to some other baser place, and afterward sheshall reprove me, that I did not accomplish what shee commanded, andso all my labour is utterly lost.

　　Perplexed with these various contradicting opinions, he waswilling divers times to turne home backe againe: yet such was theviolence of his love, and the power thereof prevailing against allsinister arguments; as he went to the grave, and removing theboordes covering it, whereinto he entred; and having despoiledScannadio of his garments, cloathed himselfe with them, and so laidhim down, having first covered the grave againe. Not long had heetarryed there, but he began to bethinke him, what manner of manScannadio was, and what strange reports had bene noised of him, notonely for ransacking dead mens graves in the night season, but manyother abhominable Villanies committed by him, which so fearfullyassaulted him; that his haire stoode on end, every member of himquaked, and every minute he imagined Scannadio rising, with intentto strangle him in the grave. But his fervent affection overcoming allthese idle feares, and lying stone still, as if he had beene thedead man indeede; he remained to see the end of his hope.

　　On the contrary side, after midnight was past, Rinuccio Palerminideparted from his lodging, to do what hee was enjoyned by his heartsMistresse, and as hee went along, divers considerations also ran inhis minde, concerning occasions possible to happen. As, falling intothe hands of Justice, with the body of Scannadio upon his backe, andbeing condemned for sacriledge, in robbing graves of the dead;either to be burned, or otherwise so punished, as might make himhatefull to his best friends, and meerely a shame to himselfe.

　　Many other the like conceits mollested him, sufficient to alterhis determination: but affection was much more prevayling in him,and made him use this consultation. How now Rinuccio? Wilt dare todeny the first request, being mooved to thee by a Gentlewoman, whomthou dearly lovest, and is the onely meanes, whereby to gaineassurance of her gracious favour? Undoubtedly, were I sure to die inthe attempt, yet I will accomplish my promise. And so he went onwith courage to the grave.

　　Alessandro hearing his arrivall, and also the removall of the bords,although he was exceedingly affraid; yet he lay quietly stil, andstirred not, and Rinuccio beeing in the grave, tooke Alessandro by thefeete, haling him forth, and (mounting him uppon his backe) went onthus loden, towards the house of Madam Francesca. As he passed alongthe streets, unseene or unmet by any, Alessandro suffered manyshrewd rushings and punches, by turnings at the streets corners, andjolting against bulkes, poasts, and stalles, which Rinuccio couldnot avoyd, in regard the night was so wonderfully darke, as heecould not see which way he went.

　　Being come somewhat neere to the Gentlewomans house, and shestanding readie in the Window with her Maide, to see when Rinuccioshould arrive there with Alessandro, provided also of an apt excuse,to send them thence like a couple of Coxcombes; it fortuned, thatthe Watchmen, attending there in the same streete, for theapprehension of a banished man, stolne into the City contrarie toorder; hearing the trampling of Rinuccioes feete, directed theircourse as they heard the noise, having their Lanthorne and lightclosely covered, to see who it should be, and what he intended, andbeating their weapons against the ground, demanded, Who goes there?Rinuccio knowing their voyces, and that now was no time for any longdeliberation: let fall Alessandro, and ran away as fast as his legscould carry him.

　　Alessandro being risen againe (although he was cloathed inScannadioes Garments, which were long and too bigge for him) fleddeaway also as Rinuccio did. All which Madame Francesca easily discernedby helpe of the Watchmens Lanthorne, and how Rinuccio carriedAlessandro on his backe, beeing attired in the Garments ofScannadio: whereat she mervailed not a litle, as also the greatboldnesse of them both. But in the midst of her mervailing, shelaughed very heartily, when she saw the one let the other fall, andboth to runne away so manfully. Which accident pleasing her beyond allcomparison, and applauding her good Fortune, to bee so happilydelivered from their daily mollestation: she betooke her selfe tohir Chamber with the Maide, avouching solemnly to her, that(questionlesse) they both affected her dearely, having undertaken sucha straunge imposition, and verie neere brought it to a finallconclusion.

　　Rinuccio, being sadly discontented, and curssing his hard fortune,would not yet returne home to his Lodging: but, when the watch wasgone forth of that streete, came backe to the place where he letfall Alessandro, purposing to accomplish the rest of his enterprize.But not finding the body, and remaining fully perswaded, that theWatchmen were possessed thereof; hee went away, greeving extreamly.And Alessandro, not knowing now what should become of him:confounded with the like griefe and sorrow, that all his hope was thusutterly overthrowne, retired thence unto his owne house, not knowingwho was the Porter which carried him.

　　The next morning, the grave of Scannadio being found open, and thebody not in it, because Alessandro had thrown it into a deep ditchneere adjoyning: all the people of Pistoya were possessed withsundry opinions, some of the more foolish sort verily beleeving,that the divell had caried away the dead body. Neverthelesse, eachof the Lovers severally made knowne to Madam Francesca, what he haddone, and how disappointed, either excusing himselfe, that thoughher command had not bin fully accomplished, yet to continue her favourtowards him. But she, like a wise and discreet Gentlewoman, seemingnot to credit either the one or other: discharged her selfe honestlyof them both, with a cutting answere, That shee would never(afterward) expect any other service from them, because they hadfayled in their first injunction.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　WHEREBY IS DECLARED, THAT WHOSOEVER IS DESIROUS TO REPREHEND

　　SINNE IN OTHER MEN, SHOULD FIRST EXAMINE HIMSELFE, THAT HE

　　BE NOT GUILTIE OF THE SAME CRIME

　　Madame Usimbalda, Lady Abbesse of a Monastery of Nuns inLombardie, arising hastily in the night time without a Candle, to takeone of her Daughter Nunnes in bed with a yong Gentleman, whereof shewas enviously accused, by certaine of her other Sisters: The Abbesseher selfe (being at the same time in bed with a Priest) imagining tohave put on her head her plaited vayle, put on the Priests breeches.Which when the poore Nunne perceyved; by causing the Abbesse to seeher owne error, she got her selfe to be absolved, and had the freerliberty afterward, to be more familiar with her frend, then formerlyshe had bin.

　　By this time, Madame Philomena sate silent, and the wit ofFrancesca, in freeing her selfe from them whom she could not fancie,was generally commended: as also on the contrary, the bold presumptionof the two amorous suiters, was reputed not to be love, but meerelyfolly. And then the Queene, with a gracious admonition, gave way forMadam Eliza to follow next; who presently thus began.

　　Worthy Ladies, Madame Francesca delivered her selfe discreetlyfrom trouble, as already hath bin related: but a yong Nun, by thehelpe and favour of Fortune, did also free her selfe (in speakingadvisedly) from an inconvenience sodainly falling on her. And as youwell know, there wants none of them, who (like bold Bayards) will bevery forward in checking other mens misdemeanors, when themselves,as my Novell will approve, deserve more justly to bee corrected. Ashapned to a Lady Abbesse, under whose governement the same young Nunnewas, of whom I am now to speake.

　　You are then to understand (Gracious Auditors) that in Lombardiethere was a goodly Monastery, very famous for Holinesse andReligion, where, among other sanctified Sisters, there was a yongGentlewoman, endued with very singular beautie, being namedIsabella, who on a day, when a Kinsman of hers came to see her atthe grate, became enamored of a young Gentleman, being then in hiscompany.

　　He likewise, beholding her to be so admirably beautifull, andconceyving by the pretty glances of her eye, that they appeared to beesilent intelligencers of the hearts meaning, grew also asaffectionately inclined towards her, and this mutuall love continuedthus concealed a long while, but not without great affliction untothem both. In the end, either of them being circumspect andprovident enough, the Gentleman contrived a meanes, whereby he mightsecretly visite his Nunne, wherewith she seemed no way discontented:and this visitation was not for once or twice, but verie often, andclosely concealed to themselves.

　　At length it came to passe, that either through their owneindiscreete carriage, or jelous suspition in some others: it wasespied by one of the Sisters, both the Gentlemans comming anddeparting, yet unknowne to him or Isabella. The saide Sister,disclosing the same to two or three more: they agreed together, toreveale it to the Lady Abbesse, who was named Madame Usimbalda, a holyand devout Lady, in common opinion of all the Nunnes, and whosoeverelse knew her.

　　They further concluded (because Isabella should not deny theyraccusation) to contrive the businesse so cunningly: that the LadleAbbesse should come her selfe in person, and take the yong Gentlemanin bed with the Nun. And uppon this determination, they agreed towatch nightly by turnes, because by no meanes they wold beprevented: so to surprise poore Isabella, who beeing ignorant of theirtreachery, suspected nothing. Presuming thus still on this secretfelicitie, and fearing no disaster to befall her: it chaunced (on anight) that the yong Gentleman being entred into the Nuns Dorter,the Scowts had descried him, and intended to be revenged on her.

　　After some part of the night was overpast, they divided themselvesinto two bands, one to guard Isabellaes Dorter doore, the other tocarry newes to the Abbesse, and knocking at her Closet doore, saide.Rise quickely Madame, and use all the hast you may, for we haveseene a man enter our Sister Isabellaes Dorter, and you may take herin bed with him. The Lady Abbesse, who (the very same night) had thecompany of a lusty Priest in bed with her selfe, as oftentimesbefore she had, and he being alwayes brought thither in a Chest:hearing these tidings, and fearing also, lest the Nunnes hastieknocking at her doore, might cause it to fly open, and so (by theirentrance) have her owne shame discovered: arose very hastily, andthinking she had put on her plaited vaile, which alwayes she walkedwith in the night season, and used to tearme her Psalter; she putthe Priests breeches upon her head, and so went away in all hastwith them, supposing them verily to be her Psalter: but making fastthe Closet doore with her keye, because the Priest should not bediscovered.

　　Away shee went in all haste with the Sisters, who were so forward inthe detection of poore Isabella, as they never regarded what manner ofvaile the Lady Abbesse wore on her head. And being come to theDorter doore, quickly they lifted it off from the hookes, and beingentred, found the two Lovers sweetly imbracing: but yet so amazed atthis sudden surprisall, as they durst not stirre, nor speake one word.The young Nunne Isabella, was raised forthwith by the other Sisters,and according as the Abbesse had comanded, was brought by them intothe Chapter-house: the yong Gentleman remaining still in theChamber, where he put on his garments, awaiting to see the issue ofthis businesse, and verily intending to act severe revenge on hisbetrayers, if any harme were done to Isabella, and afterward to takeher thence away with him, as meaning to make her amends by marriage.

　　The Abbesse being seated in the Chapter house, and all the otherNunnes then called before her, who minded nothing else but the pooreoffending Sister: she began to give her very harsh and vilespeeches, as never any transgressor suffered the like, and as to herwho had (if it should be openly knowne abroad) contaminated by herlewde life and actions, the sanctity and good renowne of the wholeMonastery, and threatned her with very severe chastisement. PooreIsabella, confounded with feare and shame, as being no way able toexcuse her fault, knew not what answer to make, but standing silent,made her case compassionable to all the rest, even thosehard-hearted Sisters which betrayed her.

　　And the Abbesse still continuing her harsh speeches, it fortuned,that Isabella raising her head, which before she dejected into hirbosome, espied the breeches on her head, with the stockings hanging oneither side of her; the sight whereof did so much encourage her,that boldly she said. Madam, let a poore offender advise you for tomend your veile, and afterward say to me what you will.

　　The Abbesse being very angry; and not understanding what shemeant, frowningly answered. Why how now saucy companion? What vaileare you prating of? Are you so malapert, to bee chatting already? Isthe deed you have done, to be answered in such immodest manner?Isabella not a jot danted by her sterne behaviour, once againe said.Good Madam let me perswade you to sette your vaile right, and thenchide me as long as you will. At these words, all the rest of theNunnes exalted their lookes, to behold what vaile the Abbesse woreon her head, wherewith Isabella should finde such fault, and she herselfe lift up her hand to feele it: and then they all perceyvedplainly, the reason of Isabellas speeches, and the Abbesse saw herowne error.

　　Hereupon, when the rest observed, that she had no help to cloud thispalpable shame withall, the tide began to turne, and hir tonguefound another manner of Language, then her former fury to pooreIsabella, growing to this conclusion, that it is impossible toresist against the temptations of the flesh. And therefore shesaide: Let all of you take occasion, according as it offereth itselfe, as both we and our predecessors have done: to be providentfor your selves, take time while you may, having this sentence alwaiesin remembrance, Si non caste, tamen caute.

　　So, having granted the yong Nunne Isabella free absolution: the LadyAbbesse returned backe againe to bed to the Priest, and Isabella tothe Gentleman. As for the other Sisters, who (as yet) were without thebenefit of friends; they intended to provide themselves so soone asthey could, being enduced thereto by so good example.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　DISCOVERING THE SIMPLICITY OF SOME SILLY WITTED MEN, AND HOW

　　EASIE A MATTER IT IS TO ABUSE AND BEGUILE THEM

　　Master Simon the Physitian, by the perswasions of Bruno, Buffalmaco,and a third Companion, named Nello, made Calandrino to beleeve, thathe was conceived great with childe. And having Physicke ministred tohim for the disease: they got both good fatte Capons and money of him,and so cured him, without any other man of deliverance.

　　After that Madame Eliza had concluded her Novell, and every one ofthe company given thankes to Fortune, for delivering poore Isabellathe faire young Nunne, from the bitter reprehensions of the asfaulty Abbesse, as also the malice of her envious Sisters; theQueene gave command unto Philostratus, that he should be the next inorder, and hee (without expecting anie other warning) began in thismanner.

　　Faire Ladies, the paltry Judge of the Marquisate, whereofyesterday I made relation to you; hindred mee then of anotherNovell, concerning silly Calandrino, wherewith I purpose now toacquaint you. And because whatsoever hath already bin spoken of him,tended to no other end but matter of meriment, hee and hiscompanions duly considered; the Novel which I shal now report, keepethwithin the selfesame compasse, and aimeth also at your contentment,according to the scope of imposed variety.

　　You have already heard what manner of man Calandrino was, andlikewise the rest of his pleasant Companions, who likewise are nowagaine to be remembred, because they are actors in our presentdiscourse. It came so to passe, that an Aunt of Calandrinoes dying,left him a legacy of two hundred Florines, wherewith he purposed topurchase some small Farme-house in the countrey, or else to enlargethe other, whereof he was possessed already. And, as if bee were todisburse some ten thousand Florines, there was not a Broker in allFlorence, but understood what he intended to doe: and all the worstwas, that the strings of his purse could stretch no higher. Bruno, andBuffalmaco (his auncient Confederates) who heard of this goodFortune befalne him, advised him in such manner as they were wont todo; allowing it much better for him, to make merrie with the moneyin good cheare among them, then to lay it out in paltry Land,whereto he would not by any meanes listen, but ridde himselfe ofthem with a dinners cost, as loath to bee at anie further chargewith them.

　　These merry Laddes meant not to leave him so; but sitting one day inserious consultation, and a third man in their companie, namedNello; they all three layde their braines in steep, by what means towash their mouths well, and Calandrino to bee at the cost thereof.

　　And having resolved what was to bee done, they met togither the nextmorning, even as Calandrino was comming foorth of his house, andsundering themselves, to avoyd all suspition, yet beeing not farredistant each from other; Nello first met him, and saide unto him, GoodMorrow Calandrino: which he requited backe agayne with the samesalutation. But then Nello standing still, looked him stedfastly inthe face: whereat Calandrino mervailing, sayd. Nello.

　　Why dost thou behold me so advisedly? Whereunto Nello answered,saying Hast thou felt any paine this last night past? Thou lookestnothing so well, as thou didst yesterday. Calandrino began instantlyto wax doubtfull, and replyed thus. Dost thou see any alteration in myface, whereby to imagine, I should feele some paine? In good faithCalandrino (quoth Nello) me thinks thy countenance is strangelychanged, and surely it proceedeth from some great cause, and so hedeparted away from him.

　　Calandrino being very mistrustfull, scratched his head, yet felte heno grievance at all; and going still on; Buffalmaco sodainelyencountred him, upon his departure from Nello, and after salutationspassing betweene them; in a manner of admiration, demanded what heayled?

　　Truly (quoth Calandrino) well enough to mine owne thinking, yetnotwithstanding, I met with Nello but even now; and he told me, thatmy countenance was very much altred; Is it possible that I shouldbee sicke, and feele no paine or distaste in any part of me?Buffalmaco answered; I am not so skilfull in judgement, as to argue onthe Nature of distemper in the body: but sure I am, that thou hastsome daungerous inward impediment, because thou lookst (almost) like aman more then halfe dead.

　　Calandrino began presently to shake, as if hee had had a Feaverhanging on him, and then came Bruno looking fearefully on him, andbefore he would utter any words, seemed greatly to bemoane him, sayingat length. Calandrino? Art thou the same man, or no? How wonderfulyart thou changed since last I saw thee, which is no longer then yesterday? I pray thee tell mee, How dooest thou feele thy health?

　　Calandrino hearing, that they all agreed in one opinion of him; hebeganne verily to perswade himselfe, that some sodaine sicknes, hadseised upon him, which they could discerne, although hee felt noanguish at all: and therefore, like a man much perplexed in minde,demanded of them, What he should do? Beleeve me Calandrino (answeredBruno) if I were worthy to give thee counsell, thou shouldst returnehome presently to thy house, and lay thee downe in thy warme Bedde,covered with so many cloathes as thou canst well endure. Then toMorrow morning, send thy Water unto Learned Mayster Doctor thePhysitian, who (as thou knowest) is a man of most singular skill andexperience: he will instruct thee presently what is the best course tobe taken, and we that have ever beene thy loving friends, will notfaile thee in any thing that lieth in our power.

　　By this time, Nello being come againe unto them, they all returnedhome with Calandrino unto his owne house, whereinto he entering veryfaintly, hee saide to his Wife: Woman, make my Bed presently ready,for I feele my selfe to be growne extreamely sicke, and see thatthou layest cloathes enow upon me. Being thus laide in his Bedde, theyleft him for that night, and returned to visite him againe the verienext morning, by which time, he had made a reservation of his Water,and sent it by a young Damosell unto Maister Doctor, who dwelt then inthe olde market place, at the signe of the Muske Mellone. Then saideBruno unto his Companions; Abide you heere to keepe him company, and Iwill walke along to the Physitian, to understand what he will say: andif neede be, I can procure him to come hither with me. Calandrino verykindely accepted his offer, saying withall. Well Bruno, thou shewstthy selfe a friend in the time of necessity, I pray thee know ofhim, how the case stands with me, for I feele a very strangealteration within mee, far beyond all compasse of my conceite.

　　Bruno being gone to the Physitian, he made such expedition, thathe arrived there before the Damosell, who carried the Water, andinformed Master Simon with the whole tricke intended: wherefore,when the Damosell was come, and hee had passed his judgementconcerning the water, he said to her.

　　Maide, go home againe, and tell Calandrino, that he must keephimselfe very warme: and I my selfe will instantly be with him, toenstruct him further in the quality of his sicknesse.

　　The Damosell delivered her message accordingly, and it was notlong before Mayster Doctor Simon came, with Bruno also in his company,and sitting downe on the beds side by Calandrino, hee began to tastehis pulse, and within a small while after, his Wife being come intothe Chamber, he said. Observe me well Calandrino, for I speake to theein the nature of a true friend; thou hast no other disease, but onlythou art great with child.

　　So soone as Calandrino heard these words, in dispairing manner hebeganne to rage, and cry out aloud, saying to his wife Ah thouwicked woman, this is long of thee, and thou hast done me thismischeefe for alwayes thou wilt be upon me, ever railing at mee, andfighting, untill thou hast gotten me under thee. Say thou divellishcreature, do I not tell thee true? The Woman, being of verie honestand civill conversation, hearing her husband speake so foolishly:blushing with shame, and hanging downe her head in bashfull manner;without returning any answer, went forth of her Chamber.

　　Calandrino continuing still in his angry humour, wringing his hands,and beating them upon his breast, said: Wretched man that I am, Whatshall I do? How shal I be delivered of this child? Which way can itcome from me into the world? I plainly perceyve, that I am noneother then a dead man, and all through the wickednesse of my Wife:heaven plague her with as many mischiefes, as I am desirous to findeease. Were I now in as good health, as heere-tofore I have beene, Iwould rise out of my bed, and never cease beating her, untill I hadbroken her in a thousand peeces. But if Fortune will be sofavourable to me, as to helpe mee out of this dangerous agony: hangme, if ever she get me under her againe, or make me such an Asse, inhaving the mastery over mee, as diuers times she hath done.

　　Bruno, Buffalmaco and Nello, hearing these raving speeches ofCalandrino, were swolne so bigge with laughter, as if their ribbeswould have burst in sunder; neverthelesse, they abstained so well asthey were able; but Doctor Simon gaped so wide with laughing as onemight easily have pluckt out all his teeth. In the end, because hecould tarry there no longer, but was preparing to depart: Calandrinothanked him for his paines, requesting that hee would be carefull ofhim, in aiding him with his best advise and counsell, and he would notbe unmindfull of him. Honest neighbour Calandrino, answered thePhisition, I would not have you to torment your selfe, in such animpatient and tempestuous manner, because I perceive the time so tohasten on, as we shall soone perceive (and that within very fewdayes space) your health well restored, and without the sense ofmuch paine; but indeed it wil cost expences. Alas Sir, saidCalandrino, mak not any spare of my purse, to procure that I mayhave safe deliverance. I have two hundred Florines, lately falne to meby the death of mine Aunt, wherewith I intended to purchase a Farme inthe Countrey: take them all if need be, onely reserving some few formy lying in Childbed. And then Master Doctor, Alas, I know not howto behave my selfe, for I have heard the grievous complaint of womenin that case, oppressed with bitter pangs and throwes; asquestionlesse they will bee my death, except you have the greater careof me.

　　Be of good cheere neighbour Calandrino, replyed Doctor Simon, I willprovide an excellent distilled drinke for you, marveilously pleasingin taste, and of soveraigne vertue, which will resolve all in threemornings, making you as whole and as sound as a Fish newly spawned.But you must have an especiall care afterward, being providently wise,least you fall into the like follies againe. Concerning thepreparation of this precious drinke, halfe a dozen of Capons, the veryfairest and fattest, I must make use of in the distillation: whatother things shall bee imployed beside, you may deliver forty Florinesto one of these your honest friends, to see all the necessaries boughtand sent me home to my house. Concerning my businesse, make you nodoubt thereof, for I will have all distilled against to morrow, andthen doe you drinke a great Glasse full every morning, fresh andfasting next your heart. Calandrino was highly pleased with his words,returning master Doctor infinite thankes, and referring all to hisdisposing. And having given forty Florines to Bruno, with othermoney beside, to buy the halfe dozen of Capons: he thought himselfegreatly beholding to them all, and protested to requite theirkindenesse.

　　Master Doctor being gone home to his house, made ready a bottel ofvery excellent Hypocrasse, which he sent the next day according to hispromise: and Bruno having bought the Capons, with other junkets, fitfor the turne, the Phisitian and his merry Companions, fed on themhartely for the givers sake. As for Calandrino, he liked his dyetdrinke excellently well, quaffing a large Glassefull off threemornings together: afterward Master Doctor and the rest came to seehim, and having felt his pulse, the Phisition said. Calandrino, thouart now as sound in health, as any man in all Florence can be: thouneedest not to keepe within doores any longer, but walke abroadboldly, for all is well and the childe gone.

　　Calandrino arose like a joyfull man, and walked daily through thestreets, in the performance of such affaires as belonged to him: andevery acquaintance he met withall, he told the condition of his suddensickenesse; and what a rare cure Master Doctor Simon had wrought onhim, delivering him (in three dayes space) of a childe, and withoutthe feeling of any paine. Bruno, Buffalmaco, and Nello, were not alittle jocond, for meeting so well with covetous Calandrino: but howthe Wife liked the folly of her Husband, I leave to the judgement ofall good Women.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　SERVING AS AN ADMONITION TO ALL MEN, FOR TAKING GAMESTERS

　　AND DRUNKARDS INTO THEIR SERVICE

　　Francesco Fortarigo, played away all that he had at Buonconvento,and likewise the money of Francesco Aniolliero, being his Master. Thenrunning after him in his shirt, and avouching that hee had robbed him:he caused him to be taken by Pezants of the Country, clothedhimselfe in his Masters wearing garments, and (mounted on his horse)rode thence to Sienna, leaving Aniolliero in his shirt, and walkedbarefooted.

　　The ridiculous words given by Calandrino to his Wife, all thewhole company hartily laughed at: but a Philostratus ceassing,Madame Neiphila (as it pleased the Queene to appoint) began tospeake thus. Vertuous Ladies, if it were not more hard and uneasie formen, to make good their understanding and vertue, then apparantpublication of their disgrace and folly; many would not labour invaine, to curbe in their idle speeches with a bridle, as you havemanifestly observed by the weake wit of Calandrino. Who needed no suchfantastick circumstance, to cure the strange disease, which heimagined (by sottish perswasions) to have: had hee not been solavish of his tongue, and accused his Wife of overmastering him. Whichmaketh me remember a Novell, quite contrary to this last related,namely, how one man may strive to surmount another in malice; yet heto sustaine the greater harme, that had (at the first) the mostadvantage of his enemy, as I will presently declare unto you.

　　There dwelt in Sienna, and not many yeeres since, two young men ofequall age, both of them bearing the name of Francesco: but the onewas descended of the Aniollieri, and the other likewise of theFortarigi; so that they were commonly called Aniolliero, andFortarigo, both Gentlemen, and well derived. Now, although in manyother matters, their complexions did differ very much: Yetnotwithstanding, they varied not in one bad qualitie, namely too greatneglect of their Fathers, which caused their more frequentconversation, as very familiar and respective friends. ButAniolliero (being a very goodly and faire conditioned young Gentleman)apparently perceiving, that he could not maintaine himselfe at Sienna,in such estate as he liked, and upon the pension allowed him by hisFather, hearing also, that at the Marquisate of Ancona, there livedthe Popes Legate, a worthy Cardinall, his much indeared good Lordand friend: he intended to goe visite him, as hoping to advance hisfortunes by him.

　　Having acquainted his Father with this determination, he concludedwith him, to have that from him in a moment which might supply hiswants because he would be clothed gallantly, and mounted honourably.And seeking for a servant necessary to attend on him, it chancedthat Fortarigo hearing thereof, came presently to Aniolliero,intreating him in the best manner he could, to let him waite on him ashis serving man, promising both dutiful and diligent attendance: yetnot to deaund any other wages, but onely payment of his ordinaryexpences. Aniolliero made him answere, that he durst not give himentertainment, not in regard of his insufficiency, and unaptnessefor service: but because he was a great Gamester, and divers timeswould be beastly drunke? whereto Fortarigo replyed that hee wouldrefraine from both those foule vices, and addict all his endeavorwholly to please him, without just taxation of any grosse errour;making such solemne vowes and protestations beside, as conqueredAniolliero, and won his consent.

　　Being entred upon his journey, and arriving in a morning atBuonconvento, there Aniolliero determined to dine, and afterward,finding the heate to be unfit for travaile; he caused a bed to beprepared, wherein being laid to rest by the helpe of Fortarigo, hegave him charge, that after the heates violence was overpast, heeshould not faile to call and awake him. While Aniolliero slept thus inhis bed, Fortarigo, never remembring his solemne vowes and promises:went to the Taverne, where having drunke indifferently, and findingcompany fit for the purpose, he fell to play at the dice with them. Ina very short while, he had not onely lost his money, but all thecloathes on his backe likewise, and coveting to recover his lossesagaine; naked in his shirt, he went to Aniollieroes Chamber, wherefinding him yet soundly sleeping, he tooke all the money he had in hispurse, and then returned backe to play, speeding in the same manner ashee did before, not having one poore penny left him.

　　Aniolliero chancing to awake, arose and made him ready, withoutany servant to helpe him; then calling for Fortarigo, and nothearing any tydings of him: he began immediately to imagine, that hewas become drunke, and so had falne asleepe in one place or other,as very often he was wont to doe. Wherefore, determining so to leavehim, he caused the male and Saddle to be set on his horse, and so tofurnish himselfe with a more honest servant at Corsignano.

　　But when hee came to pay his hoste, hee found not any penny lefthim: whereupon (as well he might) he grew greatly offended, and raisedmuch trouble in the house, charged the hoasts people to have robdehim, and threatening to have them sent as prisoners to Sienna.Suddenly entred Fortarigo in his shirt, with intent to have stolneAniollieroes garments, as formerly hee did the money out of his purse,and seeing him ready to mount on horsebacke, hee saide.

　　How now Aniolliero? What shall we goe away so soone? I pray youSir tarry a little while, for an honest man is comming hither, whohath my Doublet engaged for eight and thirty shillings; and I amsure that he will restore it me back for five and thirty, if I couldpresently pay him downe the money.

　　During the speeches, an other entred among them, who assuredAniolliero, that Fortarigo was the Thiefe which robde him of hismoney, shewing him also how much hee had lost at the Dice: WherewithAniolliero being much mooved, very angerly reprooved Fortarigo, and,but for feare of the Law, would have offered him outrage, thretning tohave him hangd by the neck, or else condemned to the Gallies belongingto Florence, and so mounted on his horse. Fortarigo making shew to thestanders by, as if Aniolliero menaced some other body, and not him,said. Come Aniolliero, I pray thee let us leave this frivilousprating, for (indeede) it is not worth a Button, and minde a matter ofmore importance: my Doublet will bee had againe for five and thirtyshillings, if the money may bee tendered downe at this very instant,whereas if we deferre it till to morrow, perhaps hee will then havethe whole eight and thirty which he lent me, and he doth me thispleasure, because I am ready (at another time) to affoord him the likecourtesie; why then should we loose three shillings, when they mayso easily be saved.

　　Aniolliero hearing him speake in such confused manner, andperceiving also, that they which stood gazing by, beleeved (as bytheir lookes appeared) that Fortarigo had not played away hisMasters mony at the Dice, but rather that he had some stocke ofFortarigoes in his custody; angerly answered; Thou sawcy companion,what have I to doe with thy Doublet? I would thou wert hangd, not onlyfor playing away my money, but also by delaying thus my journey, andyet boldly thou standest out-facing mee, as if I were no better thenthy fellow. Fortarigo held on still his former behaviour, withoutusing any respect or reverence to Aniolliero, as if all theaccusations did not concerne him, but saying, Why should wee nottake the advantage of three shillings profit? Thinkest thou, that I amnot able to doe as much for thee? why, lay out so much money for mysake, and make no more haste then needs we must, because we haveday-light enough to bring us (before night) to Torreniero. Come,draw thy purse, and pay the money, for upon mine honest word, I mayenquire throughout all Sienna, and yet not find such another Doubletas this of mine is. To say then, that I should leave it, where itnow lyeth pawned, and for eight and thirty shillings, when it isrichly more worth then fifty, I am sure to suffer a doubleendammagement thereby.

　　You may well imagine, that Aniolliero was now enraged beyond allpatience, to see himselfe both robde of his money, and overbornewith presumptuous language: wherefore, without making any morereplications, he gave the spurre to his horse, and rode away towardsTorreniero. Now fell Fortarigo into a more knavish intention againstAniolliero, and being very speedy in running, followed apace after himin his shirt, crying out still aloude to him all the way, to let himhave his Doublet againe. Aniolliero riding on very fast, to free hiseares from this idle importunity, it fortuned that Fortarigo espieddivers countrey Pezants, laboring in the fields about their businesse,and by whom Aniolliero (of necessity) must passe: To them he cryed outso loude as he could; Stay the thiefe, Stop the Thiefe, he ridesaway so fast, having robde me.

　　They being provided, some with Prongges, Pitchforkes and Spades, andothers with the like weapons fit for Husbandry, stept into the waybefore Aniolliero: and beleeving undoubtedly, that he had robde theman which pursued him in his shirt, stayed and apprehended him.Whatsoever Aniolliero could doe or say, prevailed not any thing withthe unmannerly Clownes, but when Fortarigo was arrived among them,he braved Aniolliero most impudently, saying.

　　What reason have I to spoyle thy life (thou traiterous Villaine)to rob and spoyle thy Master thus on the high way? Then turning to theCountrey Boores: How much deare friends (quoth he) am I beholding toyou for this unexpected kindnesse? You behold in what manner he leftme in my Lodging, having first playd away all my money at the Dice,and then deceiving me of my horse and garments also: but had not you(by great good lucke) thus holpe mee to stay him; a poore Gentlemanhad bin undone for ever, and I should never have found him againe.

　　Aniolliero avouched the truth of his wrong received, but the basepeazants, giving credite onely to Fortarigoes lying exclamations:tooke him from his horse, despoyled him of all his wearingapparrell, even to the very Bootes from off his Legges: suffered himto ride away from him in that manner, and Aniolliero left so in hisshirt, to dance a bare foote Galliard after him either towards Sienna,or any place else.

　　Thus Aniolliero, purposing to visite his Cousin the Cardinal likea Gallant, and at the Marquisate of Ancona, returned backe poorly inhis shirt unto Buonconvento, and durst not (for shame) repaire toSienna. In the end, he borrowed money on the other horse whichFortarigo rode on, and remained there in the Inne, whence riding toCorsignano, where he had divers Kinsmen and Friends, he continuedthere so long with them, till he was better furnished from his Father.

　　Thus you may perceive, that the cunning Villanies of Fortarigo,hindred the honest intended enterprise of Aniolliero howbeit in fittime and place, nothing afterward was left unpunished.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　IN JUST REPREHENSION OF THOSE VAINEHEADED FOOLES, THAT ARE

　　LED AND GOVERNED BY IDLE PERSWASIONS

　　Calandrino became extraordinarily enamoured of a young Damosell,named Nicholetta. Bruno prepared a Charme or writing for him,avouching constantly to him, that so soone as he touched theDamosell therewith, she should follow him whithersoever hee would haveher. She being gone to an appointed place with him, hee was foundthere by his wife, and dealt withall according to his deserving.

　　Because the Novell reported by Madame Neiphila was so sooneconcluded, without much laughter, or commendation of the wholeCompany: the Queene turned hir selfe towards Madam Fiammetta,enjoyning her to succeed in apt order; and she being as ready assodainly commanded, began as followeth. Most gentle Ladies, I amperswaded of your opinion in judgement with mine, that there is notany thing, which can bee spoken pleasingly, except it beconveniently suited with apt time and place: in which respect, whenLadies and Gentlewomen are bent to discoursing, the due election ofthem both are necessarily required. And therefore I am not unmindfull,that our meeting heere (ayming at nothing more, then to outweare thetime with our generall contentment) should tye us to the course of ourpleasure and recreation, to the same conveniency of time and place;not sparing, though some have bin nominated oftentimes in our passedarguments; yet, if occasion serve, and the nature of variety be wellconsidered, wee may speake of the selfesame persons againe.

　　Now, notwithstanding the actions of Calandrino have beeneindifferently canvazed among us; yet, remembring what Philostratus notlong since saide, That they intended to nothing more then matter ofmirth: I presume the boldlier, to report another Novell of him, besidethem already past. And, were I willing to conceale the truth, andcloath it in more circumstantiall maner: I could make use ofcontrary names, and paint it in a poeticall fiction, perhaps moreprobable, though not so pleasing. But because wandring from thetruth of things, doth much diminish (in relatic the delight of thehearers: I will build boldly on my fore-alledged reason, and tel youtruly how it hapned.

　　Niccholao Cornacchini was once a Citizen of ours, and a man of greatwealth; who, among other his rich possessions in Camerata, buildedthere a very goodly house, which being perfected ready for painting:he compounded with Bruno and Buffalmaco who bicause their workerequired more helpe then their owne, they drew Nello and Calandrinointo their association, and began to proceed in their businesse. Andbecause there was a Chamber or two, having olde moveables in them,as Bedding, Tables, and other Houshold stuffe beside, which were inthe custody of an old Woman that kepte the house, without the helpe ofany other servants else, a Son unto the saide Niccholao, beeingnamed Phillippo, resorted thither divers times, with one or otherprety Damosell in his company (in regard he was unmarried) where hewould abide a day or two with her, and then convey her home againe.

　　At one time among the rest, it chanced that he brought a Damosellthither named Nicholetta, who was maintained by a wily companion,called Magione, in a dwelling which hee had at Camaldoli, and (indeed)no honester then she should be. She was a very beautifull young woman,wearing garments of great value, and (according to her quality) wellspoken, and of commendable carriage. Comming forth of her Chamberone day, covered with a White veyle, because her haire hung looseabout her, which shee went to wash at a Well in the middle Court,bathing there also her face and hands: Calandrino going (by chance) tothe same Well for water, gave her a secret salutation. She kindlyreturning the like courtesie to him, began to observe him advisedly:more, because he looked like a man newly come thither, then anyhandsomnesse she perceyved in him.

　　Calandrino threw wanton glances at her, and seeing she was bothfaire and lovely, began to finde some occasion of tarrying, so that hereturned not with water to his other associates, yet neither knowingher, or daring to deliver one word. She, who was not to learn herlesson in alluring, noting what affectionate regards (withbashfulnesse) he gave her: answered him more boldly with the like; butmeerly in scorning manner, breathing forth divers dissembled sighsamong them: so that Calandrino became foolishly inveigled with herlove, and would not depart out of the Court, until Phillippo, standingabove in his Chamber window called her thence.

　　When Calandrino was returned backe to his businesse, he could donothing else, but shake the head, sigh, puffe, and blowe, whichbeing observed by Bruno (who alwayes fitted him according to hisfolly, as making a meer mockery of his very best behaviour) sodainlyhe said. Why how now Calandrino? Sigh, puffe, and blow man? What maybe the reason of these unwonted qualities? Calandrino immediatelyanswered, saying: My friendly Companion Bruno, if I had one to lend mea little helpe, I should very quickely become well enough. How? quothBruno, doth any thing offend thee, and wilt thou not reveale it to thyfriend Deare Bruno, said Calandrino, there is a proper handsomewoman here in the house, the goodliest creature that ever any eyebeheld, much fairer then the Queen of Fairies her selfe, who is sodeeply falne in love with mee, as thou wouldst thinke it no lesse thena wonder; and yet I never sawe her before, till yer while when I wassent to fetch water. A very strange case, answered Bruno, take heedeCalandrino, that shee bee not the lovely friend to Phillippo, our yongMaster, for then it may prove a dangerous matter.

　　Calandrino stood scratching his head an indifferent while, andthen sodainly replyed thus. Now trust me Bruno, it is to beedoubted, because he called her at his Window, and she immediatlywent up to his Chamber. But what doe I care if it be so? Have notthe Gods themselves bene beguiled of their Wenches, who were bettermen then ever Phillippo can be, and shall I stand in feare of him?Bruno replied: Be patient Calandrino, I will enquire what Woman sheis, and if she be not the wife or friend to our young masterPhillippo, with faire perswasions I can over-rule the matter,because shee is a familiar acquaintance of mine. But how shall weedoe, that Buffalmaco may not know heereof? I can never speake toher, if hee be in my company. For Buffalmaco (quoth Calandrino) I haveno feare at all, but rather of Nello, because he is a neer Kinsmanto my wife, and he is able to undo me quite, if once it should come tohis hearing. Thou saist well, replyed Bruno, therefore the matter hathneede to be very cleanly carried.

　　Now let me tell you, the Woman was well enough knowne to Bruno, asalso her quality of life, which Phillippo had acquainted himwithall, and the reason of her resorting thither. Wherefore,Calandrino going forth of the roome where they wrought, onely to gaineanother sight of Nicholetta, Bruno revealed the whole history toBuffalmaco and Nello; they all concluding together, how this amorousfit of the foole was to be followed. And when Calandrino wasreturned backe againe; in whispering maner Bruno said to him. Hastthou once more seene her? Yes, yes Bruno, answered Calandrino: Alas,she hath slaine me with her very eye, and I am no better then a deadman. Be patient said Bruno, I will goe and see whether she be the samewoman which I take her for, or no: and if it prove so, then neverfeare, but refer the businesse unto me.

　　Bruno descending downe the staires, found Phillippo and Nicholettain conference together, and stepping unto them, discoursed at large,what manner of man Calandrino was, and how farre he was falne inlove with her: so that they made a merry conclusion, what should beperformed in this case, onely to make a pastime of his hot begun love.And being come backe againe to Calandrino, he saide. It is the samewoman whereof I told thee, and therefore wee must worke wisely inthe businesse: for if Phillippo perceive any thing, all the water inArno will hardly serve to quench his fury. But what wouldst thouhave me say to her on thy behalfe, if I compasse the meanes tospeake with her? First of all (quoth Calandrino) and in the primeplace, tell her, that I wish infinite bushels of those blessings,which makes Maides Mothers, and begetteth children. Next, that I amonely hers, in any service she wil command me. Dooest thouunderstand me what I say? Sufficiently answered Bruno, leave all tome.

　　When supper time was come, that they gave over working, and weredescended downe into the Court: there they found Phillippo andNicholetta readily attending to expect some beginning of amorousbehaviour, and Calandrino glanced such leering lookes at her, coughingand spetting with hummes and haes, yea in such close and secretmanner, that a starke blinde sight might verie easily have perceyvedit.

　　She also on the other side, returned him such queint and cunningcarriage, as enflamed him farre more furiously, even as if hee wereready to leape out of himselfe. In the meane while, Phillippo,Buffalmaco and the rest that were there present, seeming as if theywere seriouslie consulting together, and perceived nothing of hisfantastick behavior, according as Bruno had appointed, could scarserefraine from extremity of laughter, they noted such antick trickes inCalandrino.Having spent an indifferent space in this foppish folly, the houre ofparting came, but not without wonderful affliction to Calandrino;and as they were going towards Florence, Bruno saide closely toCalandrino. I dare assure thee, that thou hast made her to consume andmelt, even like ice against the warme Sunne. On my word, if thouwouldst bring thy Gitterne, and sit downe by us, singing some fewamorous songs of thine owne making, when we are beneath about ourbusinesse in the Court: shee would presently leape out of theWindow, as being unable to tarry from thee.

　　I like thy counsell well Bruno, answered Calandrino; but shall Ibring my Gitterne thither indeed? Yes, in any case, replied Bruno, forMusicke is a matter of mighty prevailing. Ah Bruno (quothCalandrino) thou wouldst not credit me in the morning, when I toldethee, how the very sight of my person had wounded her: I perceivedit at the very first looke of her owne, for shee had no power toconceale it. Who but my selfe could so soone have enflamed heraffection, and being a woman of such worth and beauty as shee is?There are infinite proper handsome fellowes, that daily haunt thecompany of dainty Damosels, yet are so shallow in the affayres oflove, as they are not able to win one wench of a thousand, no, notwith all the wit they have, such is their extreame follie and illfortune.

　　Then pausing a while, and sodainely rapping out a Lovers Oath ortwo, thus he proceeded. My dearest Bruno, thou shalt see how I cantickle my Gitterne, and what good sport will ensue thereon. If thoudost observe me with judgement, why man, I am not so old as I seeme tobe, and she could perceive it at the very first view; yea, and sheshall finde it so too, when we have leysure to consult upon furtheroccasions: I finde my selfe in such a free and frolicke jocunditieof spirit, that I will make her to follow me, even as a fond womandoth after her child.

　　But beware, saide Bruno, that thou do not gripe her over-hard, andin kissing, bee carefull of biting, because the teeth stand in thyhead like the pegges of a Lute, yet make a comely shew in thy fairewide mouth, thy cheekes looking like two of our artificiall Roses,swelling amiably, when thy jawes are well fild with meat. Calandrinohearing these hansome comnendations, thought himselfe a man ofaction already, going, singing, and frisking before his companie solively, as if he had not bin in his skin.

　　On the morrow, carrying his Gitterne thither with him, to the nolittle delight of his companions, hee both played and sung a wholeBed-role of himselfe to any worke all the day: but loiteringfantastically, one while he gazed out at the window, then ran to thegate, and oftentimes downe into the Court onely to have a sight of hisMistresse. She also (as cunningly) encountred all his ollies, bysuch directions as Bruno gave her, and many more beside of her ownedevising, to quicken him still with new occasions: Bruno plaid theAmbassador betweene them, in delivering the messages fromCalandrino, and then returning her answers to him. Sometimes whenshe was absent thence (which often hapned as occasions called her)then he would write letters in her name, and bring them, as if theywere sent by her, to give him hope of what hee desired, but becauseshe was then among her kindred, yet she could not be unmindfull ofhim.

　　In this manner, Bruno and Buffalmaco (who had the managing of thisamorous businesse) made a meere Gregory of poore Calandrino, causinghim somtimes to send her, one while a pretty peece of Ivory, then afaire wrought purse, and a costly paire of knives, with other suchlike friendly tokens: bringing him backe againe, as in requital ofthem, counterfetted Rings of no valew, Bugles and bables, which heesteemed as matters of great moment. Moreover, at divers close andsodain meetings, they made him pay for many dinners and suppers,amounting to indifferent charges, onely to be careful in thefurtherance of his lovesuit, and to conceale it from his wife.Having worne out three or foure months space in this fond andfrivolous manner, without any other successe then as hath benedeclared; and Calandrino perceiving, that the worke undertaken byhim and his fellowes, grew very neere uppon the finishing, which wouldbarre him of any longer resorting thither: hee began to solicite Brunomore importunately, then all the while before he hadde done. In regardwhereof Nicholetta being one day come thither, and Bruno havingconferred both with her and Phillippo, with ful determination what wasto be done, he began with Calandrino, saying. My honest Neighbourand Friend, this Woman hath made a thousand promises, to graunt whatthou art so desirous to have, and I plainly perceive that she hathno such meaning, but meerely plaies with both our noses. In whichrespect, seeing she is so perfidious, and will not perfourme one ofall her faithfull-made promises: if thou wilt consent to have it so,she shall be compelled to do it whether she will or no. Yea marryBruno, answered Calandrino, that were an excellent course indeede,if it could be done, and with expedition.

　　Bruno stood musing awhile to himselfe, as if he had some strangestratagem in his braine, and afterward said. Hast thou so muchcorage Calandrino, as but to handle a peece of written parchment,which I will give thee? Yes, that I have answered Calandrino, I hopethat needed not to be doubted. then, saide Bruno, procure that I mayhave a piece of Virgin Parchment brought mee, with a living Bat orReremouse; three graines of Incense, and an hallowed Candle, thenleave me to effect what shal content thee. Calandrino watched allthe next night following, with such preparation as he could make,onely to catch a Bat; which being taken at the last, he broght italive to Bruno (with all the other materials appointed) who taking himalone into a backer Chamber, there hee wrote divers follies on theParchment, in the shape of strange and unusuall Charracters, whichhe delivered to Calandrino, saying: Be bold Calandrino, and buildconstantly uppon my wordes, that if thou canst but touch her with thissacred Charractred charme, she will immediately follow thee, andfulfil whatsoever thou pleasest to command hir. Wherefore, ifPhillippo do this day walke any whither abroad from this house,presume to salute her, in any manner whatsoever it be, and touchingher with the written lines, go presently to the barn of hay, whichthou perceivest so neere adjoyning, the onely convenient place thatcan be, because few or none resort thither. She shall (in despightof her blood) follow thee; and when thou hast her there, I leavethee then to thy valiant victory. Calandrino stood on tiptoe, like aman newly molded by Fortune, and warranted Bruno to fulfil alleffectually.

　　Nello, whom Calandrino most of all feared and mistrusted, had a handas deepe as any of the rest in this deceite, and was as forward alsoto have it performed, by Brunoes direction, hee went unto Florence,where being in company with Calandrinoes Wife, thus hee began.

　　Cousine, thine unkinde usage by thine husband, is not unknown to me,how he did beate thee (beyond the compasse of all reason) when hebrought home stones from the plain of Mugnone; in which regard, I amvery desirous to have thee revenged on him: which if thou wilt not do,never repute me heereafter for thy Kinsman and Friend. He is falnein love with a Woman of the common gender, one that is to be hired formoney: he hath his private meetings with her, and the place ispartly knowne to me, as by a secret appointment (made very lately) Iam credibly given to understand; wherefore walke presently alongwith me, and thou shalt take him in the heat of his knavery.

　　All the while as these words were uttering to her, shee could notdissemble her inward impatience, but starting up as halfe frantickewith fury. she said. O notorious villaine! Darest thou abuse thinehonest wife so basely? I sweare by blessed Saint Bridget, thou shaltbe paid with coyne of thine owne stampe. So casting a light wearingCloake about her, and taking a yong woman in her company; shee wentaway with Nello in no meane haste. Bruno seeing her comming a farreoff, said to Phillippo: You Sir, you know what is to be done, act yourpart according to your appointment. Phillippo went immediately intothe roome, where Calandrino and his other Consorts were at worke,and said to them. Honest friends, I have certaine occasions whichcommand mine instant being at Florence: worke hard while I amabsent, and I will not be unthankefull for it. Away hee departedfrom them, and hid himselfe in a convenient place, where he couldnot be descryed, yet see whatsoever Calandrino did: who when heimagined Phillippo to be farre enough off, descended downe into theCourt, where he found Nicholetta sitting alone, and going towards her,began to enter into discoursing with her.

　　She knowing what remained to bee done on her behalfe, drewsomewhat neere him, and shewed her selfe more familiar then formerlyshe had done: by which favourable meanes, he touched her with thecharmed Parchment, which was no sooner done; but with out using anyother kinde of language, hee went to the hay-Barne, whitherNicholletta followed him, and both being entred, he closed the Barnedoore, and then stood gazing on her, as if hee had never seene herbefore. Standing stil as in a study, or bethinking himselfe what heshould say: she began to use affable gesture to him, and taking him bythe hand, made shew as if shee meant to kisse him, which yet sherefrained, though he (rather then his life) would gladly have hadit. Why how now deare Calandrino (quoth she) jewell of my joy, comfortof my heart, how many times have I longed for thy sweet Company? Andenjoying it now, according to mine owne desire, dost thou stand like aStatue, or man alla morte? The rare tunes of the Gitterne, but (muchmore) the melodious accents of thy voyce, excelling Orpheus orAmphion, so ravished my soule, as I know not how to expresse the depthof mine affection; and yet hast thou brought me hither, onely to lookebabies in mine eyes, and not so much as speake one kinde word to me?

　　Bruno and Buffalmaco, having hid themselves close behindePhilippo, they both heard and saw all this amourous conflict, and asCalandrino was quickning his courage, and wiping his mouth, withintent to kisse her: his wife and Nello entred into the Barne, whichcaused Nicholetta to get her gone presently, sheltring her selfwhere Philippo lay scouting. But the enraged woman ranne furiouslyupon poore daunted Calandrino, making such a pitiful massacre with hernailes, and tearing the baire from his head, as hee meerely lookedlike an infected Anatomy. Fowle loathsome dog (quoth she) must yoube at your minions, and leave mee hunger-starved at home? An oldeknave with (almost) never a good tooth in thy head, and yet art thouneighing after young wenches? hast thou not worke enough at home,but must bee gadding in to other mens grounds? Are these the fruitesof wandring abroad?Calandrino being in this pittifull perplexity, stood like one neitheralive nor dead, nor daring to use any resistance against her; but fellon his knees before his Wife, holding up his hands for mercy, andentreating her (for charities sake) not to torment him any more: forhe had committed no harme at all, and the Gentlewoman was hisMasters Wife, who came with no such intent thither, as shee fondlyimagined. Wife, or wife not (quoth she) I would have none to meddlewith my I but I that have the most right to him.

　　Bruno and Buffalmaco, who had laughed all this while heartily atthis pastime, with Phillippo and Nicholetta; came running in hasteto know the reason of this loude noise, and after they had pacifiedthe woman with gentle perswasions: they advised Calandrino, to walkewith his Wife to Florence, and returne no more to worke thereagaine, least Phillippo hearing what had hapned, should be revenged onhim with some outrage. Thus poore Calandrino miserably misused andbeaten, went home to Florence with his Wife, scoulded and raild at allthe way, beside his other molestations (day and night) afterward:his Companions, Phillippo and Nicholetta, making themselves merry athis mis-fortune.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE SIXT NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS MANIFESTED, THAT AN OFFENCE COMMITTED IGNORANTLY,

　　AND BY MISTAKING; OUGHT TO BE COVERED WITH GOOD ADVISE, AND

　　CIVILL DISCRETION

　　Two yong Gentlemen, the one named Panuccio, and the other Adriano,lodged one night in a poore Inne, where one of them went to bed to theHostes Daughter, and the other (by mistaking his way in the darke)to the Hostes Wife. He which lay with the daughter, happened afterwardto the Hostes bed and told him what he had done, as thinking hespake to his own companyon. Discontentment growing betweene them,the Mother perceiving her errour, went to bed to her daughter, andwith discreete language, made a generall pacification.

　　Calandrino, whose mishaps had so many times made the wholeassembly merry, and this last passing among them with indifferentcommendations: upon a generall silence commanded, the Queene gaveorder to Pamphilus, that hee should follow next, as indeed he did,beginning thus. Praiseworthy Ladies, the name of Nicoletta, sofondly affected by Calandrino, putteth mee in minde of a Novell,concerning another Nicoletta, of whom I purpose to speake: to the endeyou may observe how by a sudden wary fore-sight, a discreet womancompassed the meanes to avoyde a notorious scandall.

　　On the plaine of Mugnone, neere to Florence, dwelt (not longsince) an honest meane man, who kept a poore Inne or Ostery fortravellers, where they might have some slender entertainement fortheir money. As he was but a poore man, so his house affoorded butvery small receit of guests, not lodging any but on necessity, andsuch as he had some knowledge of. This honest poore hoste had awoman (sufficiently faire) to his wife, by whom hee had also twochildren, the one a comely young maiden, aged about fifteene yeares,and the other a sonne, not fully (as yet) a yeare old, and suckingon the mothers brest.

　　A comely youthfull Gentleman of our City, became amorouslyaffected to the Damosell, resorting thither divers times as heetravelled on the way, to expresse how much he did respect her. And sheaccounting her fortune none of the meanest, to bee beloved by soyouthfull a Gallant, declared such vertuous and modest demeanour, asmight deserve his best opinion of her: so that their love grew to anequall simpathy, and mutuall contentment of them both, inexpectation of further effects; he being named Panuccio, and sheNicholletta.

　　The heate of affection thus encreasing day by day, Panuccio grewexceedingly desirous to enjoy the fruits of hi; long continued liking,and divers devises mustred in his braine, how he might compasse onenights lodging in her fathers house, whereof hee knew every part andparcell, as not doubting to effect what hee desired, yetundiscovered by any, but the maide her selfe.

　　According as his intention aymed, so he longed to put it inexecution, and having imparted his mind to an honest loyall friend,named Adriano, who was acquainted with the course of his love:hyring two horses, and having Portmantues behind them, filled withmatters of no moment, they departed from Florence, as if they had somegreat journey to ride. Having spent the day time where themselves bestpleased, darke night being entred, they arrived on the plaine ofMugnone, where, as if they were come from the parts of Romanio, theyrode directly to this poore Inne, and knocking at the doore, thehonest Hoste (being familiar and friendly to all commers) opened thedoore, when Panuccio spake in this manner to him. Good man, we mustrequest one nights lodging with you, for we thought to have reached sofarre as Florence, but dark night preventing us, you see at what alate houre wee are come hither. Signior Panuccio, answered thehoste, it is not unknowne to you, how unfiting my poore house is,for entertaining such guests as you are: Neverthelesse, seeing you areovertaken by so unseasonable an houre, and no other place is neere foryour receite; I will gladly lodge you so well as I can.

　　When they were dismounted from their horses, and entred into thesimple Inne: having taken order for feeding their horses, theyaccepted such provision, as the place and time afforded, requestingthe Hoste to suppe with them. Now I am to tell you, that there was butone small Chamsber in the house, wherin stood three beds, as bestthe Hoste had devised to place them, two of them standing by thewalles side, and the third fronting them both, but with such close andnarrow passage, as very hardly could one step betweene them. Thebest of these three beds was appointed for the Gentlemen, andtherein they layd them down to rest, but sleepe they could not, albeitthey dissembled it very formally. In the second Bed was Nicholetta thedaughter, lodged by her selfe, and the father and mother in the third,and because she was to give the child sucke in the night time, theradle (wherein it lay) stood close by their beds side, because thechildes crying or any other occasion concerning it, should notdisquiet the Gentlemen.

　　Panuccio having subtily observed all this, and in what manner theywent to bed; after such a space of time, as he imagined them to be allfast asleepe, he arose very softly, and stealing to the bed ofNicholetta, lay downe gently by her. And albeit she seemed somewhatafraid at the first, yet wheri she perceived who it was, shee ratherbad him welcome, then shewed her selfe any way discontented. Now whilePanuccio continued thus with the maide, it fortuned that a Cat threwdown somewhat in the house, the noise wherof awaked the wife, andfearing greater harme, then (indeed) had hapned, she arose without aCandle, and went groping in the darke, towards the place where sheeheard the noyse. Adriano, who had no other meaning but well, foundoccasion also to rise, about some naturall necessity, and making hispassage in the darke, stumbled on the childes Cradle (in the way)where the woman had set it, and being unable to passe by, withoutremoving it from the place: tooke and set it by his owne beds side,and having done the businesse for which he rose, returned to his bedagaine, never remembring to set the Cradle where first he found it.

　　The Wife having found the thing throwne downe being of no value ormoment, cared not for lighting any candle; but rating the Cat,returned backe, feeling for the bed where her Husband lay, but findingnot the Cradle there, she said to her selfe. What a foolish woman amI, that cannot well tell my selfe what I doe? Instead of my Husbandsbed, I am going to both my guests.

　　So, stepping on a little further, she found the childes Cradle,and laid her selfe downe by Adriano, thinking shee had gone right toher Husband. Adriano being not yet falne asleepe, feeling the hostessein bed with him: tooke advantage of so faire an occasion offered,and what he did, is no businesse of mine, (as I heard) neither foundthe woman any fault. Matters comming to passe in this strangemanner, and Panuccio fearing, lest sleepe seazing on him, he mightdisgrace the maides reputation: taking his kinde farewell of her, withmany kisses and sweet imbraces: returned againe to his owne Bed, butmeeting with the Cradle in his way, and thinking it stood by thehostes Bed, (as truely it did so at the first) went backe from theCradle, and stept into the hostes Bed indeed, who awaked upon his veryentrance, albeit he slept very soundly before.

　　Panuccio supposing that he was laid downe by his loving friendAdriano, merrily said to the Hoste. I protest to thee, as I am aGentleman, Nicholetta is a dainty delicate wench, and worthy to be avery good mans wife: this night shee hath given mee the sweetestentertainement, as the best Prince in the world can wish no better,and I have kist her most kindly for it. The Hoste hearing these newes,which seemed very unwelcome to him, said first to himself: What makesuch a devill heere in my Bedde? Afterward being more rashly angry,then well advised, hee said to Panuccio. Canst thou make vaunt of sucha mounstrous villany? Or thinkest thou, that heaven hath not duevengeance in store, to requite all wicked deeds of darkenesse? Ifall should sleepe, yet I have courage sufficient to right my wrong,and yet as olde as I am to rig thou shalt be sure to finde it.

　　Our amorous Panuccio being none of the wisest young men in theworld, perceiving his errour; sought not to amend it, (as well hemight have done) with some queint straine of wit, carried in quick andcleanly manner, but angerly answered. What shall I find that thoudarst doe to me? am I any way afraid of thy threatnings? The Hostesimagining she was in bed with her Husband, said to Adriano: HarkeHusband, I thinke our Guests are quarrelling together, I hope theywill doe no harme to one another. Adriano laughing outright, answered.Let them alone, and become friends againe as they fell out: perhapsthey dranke too much yesternight.

　　The woman perceiving that it was her husband that quarrelled, anddistinguishing the voyce of Adriano from his: knew presently whereshee was, and with whom; wherefore having wit at will, and desirous tocloude an error unadvisedly committed, and with no willing consentof her selfe: without returning any more words, presently she rose,and taking the Cradle with the child in it, removed it the to herdaughters bed side, although shee had no light to helpe her, andafterward went to bed to her, where (as if she were but newlyawaked) she called her Husband, to understand what angry speecheshad past betweene him and Panuccio. The Hoste replyed, saying. Didstthou not heare him wife, brag and boast, how he hath lyen this nightwith our daughter Nicholetta? Husband (quoth she) he is no honestGentleman; if hee should say so, and beleeve me it is a manifestlye, for I am in bed with her my selfe, and never yet closed mine eyestogether, since the first houre I laid me downe: it is unmannerly doneof him to speake it, and you are little lesse then a logger-head, ifyou doe beleeve it. This proceedeth from your bibbing and swillingyesternight, which (as it seemeth) maketh you to walke about the roomein your sleepe, dreaming of wonders in the night season: it were nogreat sinne if you brake your neck, to teach you keepe a fairerquarter; and how commeth it to passe, that Signior Panuccio couldnot keepe himselfe in his owne bed?

　　Adriano (on the other side) perceiving how wisely the womanexcused her owne shame and her daughters; to backe her in abusinesse so cunningly begun, he called to Panuccio, saying. Havenot I tolde thee an hundred times, that thou art not fit to lye anywhere, out of thine owne lodging? What a shame is this baseimperfection to thee, by rising and walking thus in the night-time,according as thy dreames doe wantonly delude thee, and cause thee toforsake thy bed, telling nothing but lies and fables, yet avouchingthem for manifest truthes? Assuredly this will procure no meane perillunto thee: Come hither, and keepe in thine owne bedde for meere shame.

　　When the honest meaning Host heard, what his own Wife and Adrianohad confirmed: he was verily perswaded, that Panuccio spake in adreame all this while: And to make it the more constantly apparant,Panuccio (being now growne wiser by others example) lay talking andblundring to himselfe, even as if dreames or perturbations of theminde did much molest him, with strange distractions in frantickemanner. Which the Hoste perceiving, and compassionating his case, asone man should do anothers: he tooke him by the shoulders, jogging andhunching him, saying. Awake Signior Panuccio, and get you gone henceto your owne bed.

　　Panuccio, yawning and stretching out his limbes, with unusuallgroanes and respirations, such as (better) could bee hardlydissembled: seemed to wake as out of a traunce, and calling his friendAdriano, said.

　　Adriano, is it day, that thou dost waken me? It may be day ornight replyed Adriano, for both (in these fits) are alike to thee.Arise man for shame, and come to thine lodging. Then faining to bemuch troubled and sleepie, he arose from the hoast, and went toAdrianoes bed.

　　When it was day, and all in the house risen, the hoast began tosmile at Panuccio, mocking him with his idle dreaming and talking inthe night.

　　So, falling from one merry matter to another, yet without anymislike at all: the Gentlemen, having their horses prepared, and theirPortmantues fastened behind, drinking to their hoast, mounted onhorsebacke, and they roade away towards Florence, no lesse contentedwith the manner of occasions happened, then the effects they sortedto. Afterward, other courses were taken, for the continuance of thisbegun pleasure with Nicholetta, who made her mother beleeve, thatPanuccio did nothing else but dreame. And the mother her selferemembring how kindely Adriano had used her (a fortune not expected byher before:) was more then halfe of the minde, that she did thendreame also, while she was waking.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREBY (WITH SOME INDIFFERENT REASON) IT IS CONCLUDED, THAT

　　DREAMES DO NOT ALWAYES FALL OUT TO BE LEASINGS

　　Talano de Molese dreamed, That a Wolfe rent and tore his wivesface and throate. Which dreame he told to her, with advise to keepeher selfe out of danger; which she refusing to doe, received whatfollowed.

　　By the conclusion of Pamphilus his Novel, wherein the womans readywit, at a time of such necessity, carried deserved commendations:the Queen gave command to Madam Pampinea, that she should next beginwith hers, and so she did, in this manner. In some discourses(gracious Ladies) already past among us, the truth of apparitions indreames hath partly bin approved, whereof very many have made amockery. Neverthelesse, whatsoever hath heeretofore bin sayde, Ipurpose to acquaint you with a very short Novell, of a strangeaccident happening unto a neighbour of mine, in not crediting a Dreamewhich her Husband told her.

　　I cannot tell, whether you knew Talano de Molese, or no, a man ofmuch honour, who tooke to wife a yong Gentlewoman, named Margarita, asbeautifull as the best: but yet so peevish, scornefull, andfantasticall, that she disdained any good advice given her; neythercould any thing be done, to cause her contentment; which absurd humorswere highly displeasing to her husband: but in regard he knew nothow to helpe it, constrainedly he did endure it. It came to passe,that Talano being with his wife, at a summer-house of his owne inthe country, he dreamed one night, that he saw his Wife walking in afaire wood, which adjoyned neere unto his house, and while she thuscontinued there, he seemed to see issue foorth from a corner of thesaid Wood, a great and furious Wolfe, which on her, caught her bythe face and throate, drawing her downe to the earth, and offeringto drag her thence. But he crying out for helpe, recovered her fromthe Wolfe, yet having her face and throat very pitifully rent andtorne.

　　In regard of this terrifying dreame, when Talano was risen in themorning, and sate conversing with his wife, he spake thus unto hir.Woman, although thy froward wilfull Nature be such, as hath notpermitted me one pleasing day with thee, since first we becam manand wife, but rather my life hath bene most tedious to me, asfearing still some mischeefe should happen to thee: yet let mee now inloving manner advise thee, to follow my counsell, and (this day) notto walke abroad out of this house. She demanded a reason for thisadvice of his. He related to her every particular of his dreame,adding with all these speeches.

　　True it is Wife (quoth he) that little credit should bee given todreames: neverthelesse, when they deliver advertisement of harmes toensue, there is nothing lost by shunning and avoiding them. Shefleering in his face, and shaking her head at him, replyed. Suchharmes as thou wishest, such thou dreamest of. Thou pretendest muchpittie and care of me, but all to no other end: but what mischeefesthou dreamest happening unto mee, so wouldest thou see them effectedon me. Wherefore, I will well enough looke to my selfe, both this day,and at all times else: because thou shalt never make thy selfemerry, with any such misfortune as thou wishest unto me.

　　Well Wife, answered Talano, I knew well enough before, what thouwouldst say: An unsound head is soone scratcht with the verygentlest Combe: but beleeve as thou pleasest. As for my selfe, Ispeake with a true and honest meaning soule, and once againe I doadvise thee, to keepe within our doores all this day: at least wisebeware, that thou walke not into our wood, bee it but in regard ofmy dreame. Well sir (quoth she scoffingly) once you shall say, Ifollowed your counsell: but within her selfe she fell to thismurmuring. Now I perceive my husbands cunning colouring, and why Imust not walke this day into our wood: he hath made a compact withsome common Queane, closely to have her company there, and isafraide least I should take them tardy. Belike he would have me feedamong blinde folke, and I were worthy to bee thought a starke foole,if I should not prevent a manifest trechery, being intended againstme. Go thither therefore I will, and tarry there all the whole daylong; but I will meet with him in his merchandize, and see the Pinkwherin he adventures.

　　After this her secret consultation, her husband was no sooner goneforth at one doore, but shee did the like at another, yet sosecretly as possibly she could devise to doe, and (without anydelaying) she went to the Wood, wherein she hid her selfe veryclosely, among the thickest of the bushes, yet could discerne everyway about her, if any body should offer to passe by her. While sheekept her selfe in this concealment, suspecting other mysteriousmatters, as her idle imagination had tutord her, rather then thedanger of any Wolfe: out of a brakie thicket by her, sodainly rushed ahuge and dreadfull Wolfe, as having found her by the sent, mountinguppe, and grasping her throat in his mouth, before she saw him, orcould call to heaven for mercy.

　　Being thus seised of her, he carried her as lightly away, as if sheehad bin no heavier then a Lambe, she being (by no meanes) able to cry,because he held her so fast by the throate, and hindred any helping ofher selfe. As the Wolfe carried her thus from thence, he had quitestrangled her, if certaine Shepheards had not met him, who withtheir outcries and exclaimes at the Wolfe, caused him to let her fall,and hast away to save his owne life. Notwithstanding the harme done toher throat and face, the shepheards knew her, and caried her home toher house, where she remained a long while after, carefully attendedby Physitians and Chirurgians.

　　Now, although they were very expert and cunning men all, yet couldthey not so perfectly cure her, but both her throate, and part ofher face were so blemished that whereas she seemed a rare creaturebefore, she was now deformed and much unsightly. In regard of whichstrange alteration, being ashamed to shew her selfe in any place,where formerly she had bene seene she spent her time in sorrow andmourning, repenting her insolent and scornfull carriage, as also herrash running forth into danger, upon a foolish and jealous surmise,beleeving her husbands dreames the better for ever after.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE EIGHT NOVELL

　　WHEREBY PLAINLY APPEARETH, THAT THEY WHICH TAKE DELIGHT IN

　　DECEIVING OTHERS, DO WELL DESERVE TO BE DECEIVED THEMSELVES

　　Blondello (in a merry maner) caused Guiotto to beguile himselfe of agood dinner: for which deceit, Guiotto became cunningly revenged, byprocurng Blondello to be unreasonably beaten and misused.

　　It was a generall opinion in the whole Joviall Companie, thatwhatsoever Talano saw in his sleepe, was not anie dreame, but rather avision: considring, every part thereof fell out so directly, withoutthe lest failing. But when silence was enjoyned, then the Queenegave forth by evident demonstration, that Madam Lauretta was next tosucceed, whereupon she thus began. As all they (judicious hearers)which have this day spoken before me, derived the ground or project oftheir Novels, from some other argument spoken of before: even so,the cruell revendge of the Scholler, yesterday discoursed at largeby Madame Pampinea, maketh me to remember another Tale of like nature,some-what greevous to the sufferer, yet not in such cruell measureinflicted, as that on Madam Helena.

　　There dwelt sometime in Florence, one who was generally called bythe name of Guiotto, a man being the greatest Gourmand, and grossestfeeder, as ever was seene in any Countrey, all his meanes andprocurements meerly unable to maintaine expences for filling hisbelly. But otherwise he was of sufficient and commendable carriage,fairely demeaned, and well- discoursing on any argument: yet, not as acurious and spruce Courtier, but rather a frequenter of rich mensTables, where choice of good cheere is sildome wanting, and suchshould have his company, albeit not invited, yet (like a boldintruder) he had the courage to bid himselfe welcome.

　　At the same time, and in our City of Florence also, there wasanother man, named Blondello, very low of stature, yet comly formed,quicke witted, more neat and brisk then a Butterflye, alwaieswearing a wrought silke cap on his head, and not a haire staring outof order, but the tuft flourishing above the forehead, and he suchanother trencher-fly for the table, as our forenamed Guiotto was. Itso fel out on a morning in the Lent time, that hee went into theFishmarket, where he bought two goodly Lampreyes, for Messer Vierode Cherchi, and was espied by Guiotto, who to Blondello) said. What isthe meaning of this cost, and for whom is it? Whereto Blondello thusanswered. Yesternight, three other Lampries, far fairer and fatterthen these, and a whole Sturgeon, were sent unto Messer CorsoDonati, and being not sufficient to feede divers Gentlemen, whom heehath invited this day to dine with him, hee caused me to buy these twobeside: Doest not thou intend to make one among them? Yes I warrantthee, replied Guiotto, thou knowst I can invite my selfe thither,without any other bidding.

　　So parting; about the houre of dinner time, Guiotto went to thehouse of the saide Messer Corso, whom he found sitting and talkingwith certain of his neighbors, but dinner was not (as yet) ready,neither were they come thither to dinner. Messer Corso demaunded ofGuiotto, what newes with him, and whither he went? Why Sir (saidGuiotto) I come to dine with you, and your good company. Wherto MesserCorso answered, That he was welcom, and his other friends beinggone, dinner was served in, none els therat present but Messer Corsoand Guiotto: al the diet being a poore dish of Pease, a litle piece ofTunny, and a few smal fishes fried, without any other dishes to followafter. Guiotto seeing no better fare, but being disapointed of hisexpectation, as longing to feed on the Lampries and Sturgeon, and soto have made a ful dinner indeed: was of a quick apprehension, andapparantly perceived, that Blondello had meerly guld him in a knavery,which did not a litle vex him, and made him vow to be revenged onBlondello, as he could compasse occasion afterward.

　　Before many dales were past, it was his fortune to meete withBlondello, who having told this jest to divers of his friends, andmuch good merriment made thereat: he saluted Guiotto in ceremoniousmanner, saying. How didst thou like the fat Lampreyes and Sturgeon,which thou fedst on at the house of Messer Corso Donati? Wel Sir(answered Guiotto) perhaps before eight dayes passe over my head, thoushalt meet with as pleasing a dinner as I did. So, parting away fromBlondello, he met with a Porter or burthen-bearer, such as are usuallysent on errands; and hyring him to deliver a message for him, gave hima glasse bottle, and bringing him neere to the Hal-house ofCavicciuli, shewed him there a knight, called Signior PhillipoArgenti, a man of huge stature, stout, strong, vain-glorious, fierceand sooner mooved to anger then any other man. To him (quothGuiotto) thou must go with this bottle in thy hand, and say thus tohim. Sir, Blondello sent me to you, and courteously entreateth you,that you would enrubinate this glasse bottle with your best ClaretWine; because he would make merry with a few friends of his. Butbeware he lay no hand on thee, because he may bee easi induced tomisuse thee, and so my businesse be disappointed. Well Sir replied thePorter, shal I say any thing else unto him? No (quoth Guiotto) only goand deliver this message, and when thou art returned, Ile pay thee forthy paines.

　　The Porter being gone to the house, delivered his message to theknight, who being a man of no great civill breeding, but furious,rash, and inconsiderate: presently conceived, that Blondello (whomhe knew well enough) sent this message in meere mockage of him, andstarting up with fiery lookes, said: What enrubination of Claretshould I send him? and what have I to do with him, or his drunkenfriends? Let him and thee go hang your selves together. So he stept tocatch hold on the Porter, but he (being well warnd before) wasquicke and nimble, and escaping from him, returned backe to Guiotto(who observed all) and told him the answer of Signior Phillippo.Guiotto not a little contented, paied the Porter, and taried not inany place til he met with Blondello, to whom he said. When wast thouat the Hall of Cavicciuli? Not a long while, answerd Blondello, butwhy dost thou demand such a question? Because (quoth Guiotto)Signior Phillippo hath sought about for thee, yet knowe not I whathe would have with thee. Is it so? replied Blondello, then I wil walkethither presently, to understand his pleasure.

　　When Blondello was thus parted from him, Guiotto folowed not farreoff behind him, to behold the issue of this angry businesse; andSignior Phillippo, because he could not catch the Porter, continuedmuch distempred, fretting and fuming, in regard he could notcomprehend the meaning of the Porters message: but onely surmized,that Blondello (by the procurement of some body else) had done this inscorne of him.

　　While he remained thus deeply discontented, he espied Blondellocomming towards him, and meeting him by the way, he stept close tohim, and gave him a cruell blow on the face, causing his nose tofall out a bleeding. Alas Sir, said Blondello, wherefore do you strikeme? Signior Phillippo, catching him by the haire of the head, trampledhis wrought night-cap in the dirt, and his cloke also; when, layingmany violent blowes on him, he said. Villanous Traitor as thou art,Ile teach thee what it is to enrubinate with Claret, either thy selfe,or any of thy cupping companions: . ons: Am I a child, to be jestedwithall?

　　Nor was he more furious in words, then in strokes also, beatinghim about the face, hardly leaving any haire on his head, and dragginghim along in the mire, spoyling all his garments, and he not able(from the first blow given) to speake a word in defence of himselfe.In the end, Signior Phillippo having extreamly beaten him, and manypeople gathering about them, to succour a man so much misused, thematter was at large related, and manner of the message sending. Forwhich, they all present, did greatly reprehend Blondello,considering he knew what kinde of man Philippo was, not any way tobe jested with Blondello in teares constantly maintained, that henever sent any such message for wine, or intended it in the leastdegree: so, when the tempest was more mildly calmed, and Blondello(thus cruelly beaten and durtied) had gotten home to his owne house,he could then remember, that (questionles) this was occasioned byGuiotto.

　　After some few dayes were passed over, and the hurts in his faceindifferently cured; Blondello beginning to walke abroade againe,chanced to meet with Guiotto: who laughing heartily at him, sayde.Tell me Blondello, how doost thou like the enrubinating Clarret ofSignior Phillippo? As well (quoth Blondello) as thou didst theSturgeon and Lampreyes at Messer Corso Donaties. Why then (saydeGuiotto) let these two tokens continue familiar betweene thee andme, when thou wouldst bestow such another dinner on mee, then wil Ienrubinate thy nose with a bottle of the same Claret. But Blondelloperceived (to his cost) that hee had met with the worser bargaine, andGuiotto got cheare, without any blowes: and therefore desired apeacefull attonement, each of them (alwayes after) abstaining fromflouting one another.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　CONTAINING AN EXCELLENT ADMONITION, THAT SUCH AS COVET TO HAVE

　　THE LOVE OF OTHER MEN, MUST FIRST LEARNE THEMSELVES, HOW TO LOVE:

　　ALSO, BY WHAT MEANES SUCH WOMEN AS ARE CURST AND SELF-WILLED, MAY

　　BE REDUCED TO CIVILL OBEDIENCE

　　Two yong Gentlemen, the one named Melisso, borne in the City ofLaiazzo: and the other Giose of Antioche, travalled together untoSalomon, the famous King of Great Britaine. The one desiring to learnewhat he should do, whereby to compasse and winne the love of men.The other craved to be enstructed by what meanes hee might reclaime anheadstrong and unruly wife. And what answeres the wise King gaveunto them both, before they departed away from him.

　　Upon the conclusion of Madame urettaes Novell, none now ained tosucceede next in er, but onely the Queene r viledge reserved,granted to Dioneus; wherefore, after they had all smiled at thefolly of Blondello, with a chearfull countenance thus the Queenebegan.

　　Honourable Ladies, if with advised judgement, we do duly considerthe order of all things, we shall very easily perceyve, That the wholeuniversall multiplicitie of Women, by Nature, custome, and lawes,are and ought to be subject to men, yea, and to be governd by theirdiscretion. Because every one desiring to enjoy peace, repose andcomfort with them, under whose charge they are; ought to be humble,patient and obedient, over and beside her spotlesse honesty, whichis the crowne and honour of every good woman. And although thoselawes, which respect the common good of all things, or rather useand custome (as our wonted saying is) the powers wherof are verygreat, and worthy to be reverenced, should not make us wise in thiscase. Yet Nature hath given us a sufficient demonstration, in creatingour bodies more soft and delicate, yea, and our hearts timorous,fearefull, benigne and compassionable, our strength feeble, our voycespleasing, and the motion of our members sweetly plyant: all whichare apparant testimonies, that wee have neede of others government.

　　Now, it is not to be denyed, that whosoever hath need of helpe,and is to bee governed: meerely reason commandeth, that they shouldbee subject and obedient to their governour. Who then should we havefor our helps and governours, if not men? Wherfore, we should beintirely subject to them, in giving them due honour and reverence, andsuch a one as shall depart from this rule: she (in mine opinion) isnot onely worthy of grievous reprehension, but also severechastisement beside. And to this exact consideration (over and abovedivers other important reasons) I am the rather induced, by theNovel which Madame Pampinea so lately reported, concerning the frowardand wilfull wife of Talano, who had a heavier punishment inflictedon her, then her Husband could devise to doe. And therefore it is myperemptory sentence, that all such women as will not be gracious,benigne and pleasing: doe justly deserve (as I have already said)rude, rough and harsh handling, as both nature, custome and lawes havecommanded.

　　To make good what I have said, I wil declare unto you the counselland advise, given by Salomon, the wise and famous King of GreatBritaine, as a most wholesome and soveraigne medicine for the cureof such a dangerous disease, in any woman so fouly infected. Whichcounsel (notwithstanding) all such women as have no need of thisPhisicke, I would not have them to imagine, that it was meant forthem, albeit men have a common Proverbe, to wit.

　　As the good horse and bad horse, doe both need the spurre.

　　So a good wife and bad wife, a wand will make stirre.

　　Which saying, whosoever doth interpret it in such pleasing manner asthey ought, shal find it (as you al wil affirm no lesse) to be verytrue: especially in the morall meaning, it is beyond allcontradiction. Women are naturally all unstable, and easilyenclining to misgovernment; wherefore to correct the iniquity ofsuch a distemperature in them that out-step the tearmes and boundsof womanhood, a wand hath been allowed for especiall phisicke. As inthe like manner, for support of vertue, in those of contrarycondition, shaming to be sullyed with so grosse a sinne: thecorrecting Wand may serve as a walking staffe, to protect them fromall other feares. But, forbearing to teach any longer; let mee proceedto my purpose, and tell you my Novell.

　　In those ancient and reverend dayes, wherof I am now to speake,the high renowne and admirable wisedome of Salomon, King of GreatBrittain, was most famous throughout all parts of the world; foranswering all doubtfull questions and demaunds whatsoever, thatpossibly could be propounded to him. So that many resorted to him,from the most remote and furthest off countreyes, to heare hismiraculous knowledge and experience, yea, and to crave his counsell,in matters of greatest importance. Among the rest of them whichrepaired thither, was a rich yong Gentleman, honourably descended,named Melisso, who came from the City of Laiazzo, where he was bothborne, and dwelt.

　　In his riding towards France, as he passed by Naples, heeovertooke another yong Gentleman, a native of Antioch, and namedGiosefo, whose journey lay the same way as the others did. Havingridden in company some few dayes together, as it is a custome commonlyobserved among Travellers, to understand one anothers Countrey andcondition, as also to what part his occasions call him: so happened itwith them, Giosefo directly telling him, that he journyed, towards thewise King Salomon, to desire his advise what meanes he shouldobserve in the reclaiming of a wilfull wife, the most froward andselfe-willed woman that ever lived; whom neither faire perswasions,nor gentle courtesies could in any manner prevaile withall.Afterward he demaunded of Melisso, to know the occasion of histravell, and whither.

　　Now trust me Sir, answered Melisso, I am a native of Laiazzo, and asyou are vexed with one great mis-fortune, even so am I offended withanother. I am young, wealthy, well derived by birth, and allowliberall expences, for maintaining a worthy table in my house, withoutdistinguishing persons by their rancke and quality, but make it freefor all commers, both of the city, and all places els. Notwithstandingall which bounty and honourable entertainement, I cannot meet with anyman that loveth me. In which respect, I journey to the same place asyou doe, to crave the counsell of so wise a King, what I should doe,whereby I might procure men to love me. Thus like two well-metfriendly companions, they rode on together, untill they arrived inGreat Britaine, where, by meanes of the Noble Barons attending onthe King, they were brought before him. Melisso delivered his minde invery few words, whereto the King made no other answere, but this:Learne to love. Which was no sooner spoken, but Melisso wasdismissed from the Kings presence.

　　Giosefo also relating, wherefore he came thither; the Kingreplying onely thus: Goe to the Goose Bridge: and presently Giosefohad also his dismission from the King. Comming forth, he found Melissoattending for him, and revealed in what manner the King had answeredhim: whereupon, they consulted together, concerning both theiransweres, which seemed either to exceed their comprehension, or elsewas delivered them in meere mockery, and therefore (more then halfediscontented) they returned homeward againe.

　　After they had ridden on a few dayes together, they came to a River,over which was a goodly Bridge, and because a great company ofHorses and Mules (heavily laden, and after the manner of a Caravanof Camels in Egypt) were first to passe over the saide Bridge; theygladly stayed to permit their passe. The greater number of thembeing already past over, there was one shie and skittish Mule(belike subject to fearefull starting, as oftentimes we see horseshave the like ill quality) that would not passe over the Bridge by anymeanes, wherefore one of the Muletters tooke a good Cudgell, and smoteher at the first gently, as hoping so to procure her passage.Notwithstanding, starting one while backeward, then againe forward,side-wayes, and every way indeed, but the direct Roadway she would notgoe.

　　Now grew the Muletter extreamely angry, giving her many cruellstroakes, on the head, sides, flancks and all parts else, but yet theyproved to no purpose, which Melisso and Giosefo seeing, and being(by this meanes) hindred of their passage, they called to theMuletter, saying. Foolish fellow, what doest thou? Intendest thou tokill the Mule? why dost thou not leade her gently, which is thelikelier course to prevaile by, then beating and misusing her asthou dost? Content your selves Gentlemen (answered the Muletter) youknow your horses qualities, as I doe my Mules, let mee deale withher as I please. Having thus spoken, he gave her so many violentstrokes, on head, sides, hippes, and every where else, as made herat last passe over the Bridge quietly, so that the Muletter wonnethe Mastery of his Mule.

　　When Melisso and Giosefo had passed over the Bridge, where theyintended to part each from other; a sudden motion happened into theminde of Melisso, which caused him to demaund of an aged man (who satecraving almes of Passengers at the Bridge foot) how the Bridge wascalled: Sir, answered the old man, this is called, The Goose Bridge.Which words when Giosefo heard, hee called to minde the saying of KingSalomon, and therefore immediately saide to Melisso. Worthy friend,and partner in my travell, I dare now assure sure that the counsellgiven me by King Salomon, may fall out most effectall and true: ForI plainely perceive, that I knew not how to handle my selfe-will'dwife, untill the Muletter did instruct me. So, requesting still toenjoy the others Company, they journeyed on, till at the length theycame to Laiazzo, where Giosefo retained Melisso still with him, forsome repose after so long a journey, and entertained him with veryhonourable respect and courtesie.

　　One day Giosefo said to his Wife: Woman, this Gentleman is myintimate friend, and hath borne me company in all my travell: suchdyet therfore as thou wilt welcome him withall, I would have itordered (in dressing) according to his direction. Melisso perceivingthat Giosefo would needs have it to be so; in few words directed hersuch a course, as (for ever) might be to her Husbands contentment. Butshe, not altring a jote from her former disposition, but ratherfarre more froward and tempestuous: delighted to vexe and crossehim, doing every thing quite contrary to the order appointed. WhichGiosefo observing, angerly he said unto her. Was it not tolde you bymy friend, in what manner he would have our Supper drest? Sheturning fiercely to him, replyed. Am I to be directed by him orthee? Supper must and shall bee drest as I will have it: if itpleaseth mee, I care not who doth dislike it; if thou wouldst haveit otherwise, goe seeke both your Suppers where you may have it.

　　Melisso marvelling at her froward answere, rebuked her for it invery kind manner: whereupon, Giosefo spake thus to her. I perceivewife, you are the same woman as you were wount to be: but beleeve meon my word, I shal quite alter you from this curst complexion. Soturning to Melisso, thus he proceeded. Noble friend, we shall tryanone, whether the counsell of King Salomon bee effectuall, or no; andI pray you, let it not be offensive to you to see it; but ratherhold all to be done in merriment. And because I would not behindered by you, doe but remember the answere which the Mulettergave us, when we tooke compassion on his Mule. Worthy friend,replyed Melisso, I am in your owne house, where I purpose not toimpeach whatsoever you doe.

　　Giosefo, having provided a good Hollywand, went into the Chamber,where his wife sate railing, and despitefully grumbling, wheretaking her by the haire of her head, he threw her at his feete,beating her extreamely with the wand. She crying, then cursing, nextrailing, lastly fighting, biting and scratching, when she felt thecruell smart of the blowes, and that all her resistance served to noend: then she fell on her knees before him, and desired mercy forcharities sake. Giosefo fought still more and more on head, armes,shoulders, sides, and all parts else, pretending as if he heard nother complaints, but wearied himselfe wel neere out of breath: sothat (to be briefe) she that never felt his fingers before,perceived and confessed, it was now too soone. This being done, heereturned to Melisso, and said: Tomorrow we shall see a miracle, andhow availeable the counsell is of going to the Goose Bridge. Sositting a while together, after they had washed their hands, and supt,they withdrew to their lodgings.

　　The poore beaten woman, could hardly raise her selfe from theground, which yet (with much adoe) she did, and threw her selfe uponthe bed, where she tooke such rest as she could: but arising early thenext morning, she came to her Husband, and making him a very lowcourtesie, demaunded what hee pleased to have for his dinner; hesmiling heartely thereat, with Melisso, tolde her his mind. And whendinner time came, every thing was ready according to the directiongiven: in which regard, they highly commended the counsell, whereofthey made such an harsh construction at the first.

　　Within a while after, Melisso being gone from Giosefo, andreturned home to his owne house: hee acquainted a wise and reverendman, with the answere which king Salomon gave him, whereto heereceived this reply. No better or truer advise could possibly be givenyou, for well you know, that you love not any man; but the bountifulbanquets you bestow on them, is more in respect of your ownevaine-glory, then any kind affection you beare to them: Learne then tolove men, as Salomon advised, and you shall be beloved of them againe.Thus our unruly Wife became mildely reclaimed, and the yong Gentleman,by loving others, found the fruits of reciporall affection.

　　THE NINTH DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　IN JUST REPROOFE OF SUCH FOOLISH MEN, AS WILL BE GOVERNED BY

　　OVER-LIGHT BELEEFE

　　John de Barolo, at the instance and request of his Gossip Pietroda Tresanti, made an enchantment, to have his wife become a Mule.And when it came to the fastening on of the taile; Gossip Pietro bysaying she should have no taile at all, spoyled the whole enchantment.

　　This Novell reported by the Queene, caused a little murmuringamong the Ladies, albeit the men laughed heartely thereat: but afterthey were all growne silent, Dioneus began in this manner. GraciousBeauties, among many white Doves, one blacke Crow will seeme moresightly, then the very whitest Swanne can doe. In like manner, among amultitude of wise men, sometimes one of much lesse wisedome anddiscretion, shall not onely increase the splendour and Majestie oftheir maturity, but also give an addition of delight and solace.

　　In which regard, you all being modest and discreet Ladies, and myselfe more, much defective in braine, then otherwise able: in makingyour vertues shine gloriously, through the evident apparance of mineowne weakenesse, you should esteeme the better of mee, by how much Iseeme the more cloudy and obscure. And consequently, I ought to havethe larger scope of liberty, by plainely expressing what I am, andbe the more patiently endured by you all, in saying what absurdly Ishall; then I should be if my speeches savoured of absolute wisdome. Iwill therfore tell you a Tale, which shall not be of any great length,whereby you may comprehend, how carefully such things should beobserved, which are commanded by them, as can effect matters by thepower of enchantment, and how little delayance also ought to be insuch, as would not have an enchantment to be hindered.

　　About a yeare already past since, there dwelt at Barletta, an honestman, called John de Barolo, who because he was of poore condition; formaintenance in his contented estate, provided himselfe of a Mule, tocarry commodities from place to place, where Faires and Markets werein request, but most especially to Apuglia, buying and selling inthe nature of a petty Chapman. Travelling thus thorow theCountreyes, he grew into great and familiar acquaintance, with one whonamed himselfe Pietro da Tresanti, following the same Trade of life ashe did, carrying his commodities upon an Asse. In signe of amitie,according to the Countreyes custome, he never tearmed him otherwisethen by the name of Gossip Pietro and alwayes when he came toBarletta, he brought him to his own house, taking it as his Inne,entreating him very friendly, and in the best manner he could deviseto doe. On the other side, Gossip Pietro being very poore, havingbut one simple habitation in the village of Tresanti, hardly sufecientfor him, and an handsome young woman which he had to his wife, as alsohis Asse: evermore when John de Barolo came to Tresanti, he wouldbring him to his poore abiding, with all his uttermost abilitie ofentertainement, in due acknowledgement of the courtesie he afforded tohim at Barletta. But when he came to take repose in the nightseason, Gossip Pietro could not lodge him as gladly he would:because he had but one silly bed, wherein himselfe and his wife lay;so that John de Barolo was faigne to lie on a little straw, in a smallstable, close adjoyning by his owne Mule and the Asse.

　　The woman understanding, what good and honest welcome, Gossip Johnafforded her husband, when he came to Barletta, was often very willingto goe lodge with an honest neighbour of hers, called Carapresa diGludice Leo, because the two Gossips might both lie together in onebed; wherewith divers times she acquainted her Husband, but by nomeanes he would admit it.

　　At one time among the rest, as she was making the same motion againeto her Husband, that his friend might be lodged in better manner:Gossip John thus spake to her. Good Zita Carapresa, never molestyour selfe for me, because I lodge to mine owne contentment, and somuch the rather, in regard that whensoever I list: I can convert myMule into a faire young woman, to give mee much delight in thenight-season, and afterward make her a Mule againe: thus am I neverwithout her company.

　　The young woman wondring at these words, and beleeving he did notfable in them: she told them to her Husband, with this additionbeside, Pietro (quoth she) if he be such a deare friend to thee, asthou hast often avouched to me; wish him to instruct thee in so rare acunning, that thou maist make a Mule of me; then shalt thou haveboth an Asse and a Mule to travell withall about thy businesse,whereby thy benefit will be double: and when we returne home to ourhouse, then thou maist make mee thy wife againe, in the same conditionas I was before. Gossip Pietro, who was (indeed) but a very Coxecombe;beleeved also the words to be true, yeelding therefore the more gladlyto her advise; and moving the matter to his Gossip John, to teachhim such a wonderfull secret, which would redound so greatly to hisbenefit: but John began to disswade him from it, as having spoken itin merriment, yet perceiving, that no contradiction would serve toFrevaile, thus he began.

　　Seeing you will needs have it so, let us rise to morrow morningbefore day, as in our travell we use to doe, and then I will shewyou how it is to be done: onely I must and doe confesse, that the mostdifficult thing of all the rest, is, to fasten on the taile, as thoushalt see.

　　Gossip Pietro and his wife, could hardly take any rest all the nightlong, so desirous they were to have the deed done; and thereforewhen it drew towards day, up they arose, and calling Gossip John, hecame presently to them in his shirt, and being in the Chamber withthem, he said. I know not any man in the world, to whom I woulddisclose this secret, but to you, and therefore because you soearnestly desire it, I am the more willing to doe it. Onely you mustconsent, to doe whatsoever I say, if you are desirous to have it done.Faithfully they ey ,h promised to performe all, whereupon Johndelivering a lighted Candle to Gossip Petro, to hold in his hand,said. Marke well what I doe, and remember all the words I say: butbe very carefull, that whatsoever thou hearest or seest, thou doenot speake one word, for then the enchantment will be utterlyoverthrowne, onely wish that the taile may be well set on, for thereinconsisteth all the cunning.

　　Gossip Pietro holding the Candle, and the woman being prepared asJohn had appointed her, she bowed her selfe forwardes with her handsset to the ground, even as if she stood upon foure feete. First withhis hands he touched her head and face, saying, Heere is the goodlyhead of a Mule: then handling her disheveld haire, termed them thegoodly mane of a Mule. Afterwardes, touching the body, armes, legs,and feete, gave them all the apt names (for those parts) belongingto a Mule, nothing else remaining, but onely the forming of the taile,which when Pietro perceived, how John was preparing to fasten it on(having no way misliked all his former proceeding:) he called tohim, saying: Forbeare Gossippe John, my Mule shal have no taile atall, I am contented to have her without a taile.

　　How now Gossip Pietro? answered John, What hast thou done? Thou hastmard all by this unadvised speaking, even when the worke was almostfully finished. It is no matter Gossip (answered Pietro) I can like myMule better without a taile, then to see it set on in such manner.

　　The fond yong woman, more covetously addicted to gayne andcommodity, then looking into the knavish intention of her Gossip John;began to grow greatly offended.

　　Beast as thou art (quoth she to her Husband) why hast thouoverthrowne both thine owne good Fortune and mine? Diddest thou eversee a Mule without a taile? Wouldst thou have had him make me amonster? Thou art wretchedly poore, and when we might have binenriched for ever, by a secret knowne to none but our selves, thou artthe Asse that hast defeated all, and made thy friend to become thineenemy. Gossippe John began to pacifie the woman, with solemneprotestations of his still continuing friendship, albeit(afterwards) there was no further desiring of any more Mulemaking: butGossip Pietro fel to his former Trading onely with his Asse, as he wasno lesse himselfe, and hee went no more with Gossip John to the Fairesin Apuglia, neyther did he ever request, to have the like peece ofservice done for him.

　　Although there was much laughing at this Novell, the Ladiesunderstanding it better, then Dioneus intended that they should havedone, yet himselfe scarsely smiled. But the Novels being all ended,and the Sunne beginning to loose his heate; the Queene also knowing,that the full period of her government was come: dispossessing herselfe of the Crowne, shee placed it on the head of Pamphilus, whowas the last of all to be honoured with this dignity; wherefore(with a gracious smile) thus she spake to him.

　　Sir, it is no meane charge which you are to undergo, in makingamends (perhaps) for all the faults committed by my selfe and therest, who have gone before you in the same authority; and, may itprove as prosperous unto you, as I was willing to create you our King.Pamphilus having received the Honor with a chearfull mind, thusanswered. Madam, your sacred vertues, and those (beside) remainingin my other Subjects, will (no doubt) worke so effectually for me,that (as the rest have done) I shall deserve your generall goodopinion. And having given order to the Master of the Houshold (asall his predecessors had formerly done, for every necessaryoccasion; he turned to the Ladies, who expected his gracious favour,and said.

　　Bright Beauties, it was the discretion of your late Soveraigne andQueene, in regard of ease and recreation unto your tyred spirits, togrant you free liberty, for discoursing on whatsoever your selves bestpleased: wherefore, having enjoyed such a time of rest, I am ofopinion, that it is best to returne once more to our wonted Law, inwhich respect, I would have every one to speake in this manner tomorrow. Namety, of those men or women, who have done any thingbountifully or magnificently, either in matter of amity, or otherwise.The relation of such worthy arguments, wil (doubtlesse) give anaddition to our very best desires, for a free and forwardinclination to good actions, whereby our lives (how short soeverthey bee) may perpetuate an ever-living renowne and fame, after ourmortall bodies are converted into dust, which (otherwise)

　　are no better then those of bruite beasts, reason onelydistinguishing this difference, that as they live to perish utterly,so we respire to reigne in eternity. Theame was exceedingly pleasingto the whole Company; who being all risen, by permission of the newKing, every one fel to their wonted recreations, as best agreed withtheir owne disposition; untill the houre for Supper came, wherein theywere served very sumptuously. But being risen from the Table, theybegan their dances, among which, many sweet Sonnets were enterlaced,with such delicate Tunes as moved admiration. Then the Kingcommanded Madam Neiphila, to sing a song in his name, or how her selfestood best affected. And immediatly with a cleare and rare voice, thusshe began.

　　THE SONG

　　THE CHORUS SUNG BY ALL THE COMPANIE

　　In the Spring season,

　　Maides have best reason,

　　To dance and sing;

　　With Chaplets of Flowers,

　　To decke up their Bowers,

　　And all in honour of the Spring.

　　I heard a Nimph that sate alone,

　　By a fountaines side:

　　Much her hard Fortune to bemone,

　　For still she cride:

　　Ah! Who will pitty her distresse,

　　That findes no foe like ficklenesse?

　　For truth lives not in men:

　　Poore soule, why live I then?

　　In the Spring season, etc.

　　Oh, How can mighty Love permit,

　　Such a faithlesse deed,

　　And not in justice punish it

　　As treasons meed?

　　I am undone through perjury,

　　Although I loved constantly:

　　But truth lives not in men,

　　In the Spring season, etc.

　　When I did follow Dyans traine,

　　As a loyall Maide,

　　I never felt oppressing paine,

　　Adiew to all my former joyes,

　　And all in honour of the Spring.This Song, most sweetly sung by Madame Neiphila, was especiallycommended, both by the King, and all the rest of the Ladies. Whichbeing fully finished, the King gave oder, that everie one shouldrepaire to their Chambers, because a great part of the night wasalready spent.

　　THE INDUCTION TO THE TENTH AND LAST DAY

　　WHEREON, UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF PAMPHILUS, THE SEVERALL

　　ARGUMENTS DO CONCERNE SUCH PERSONS, AS EITHER BY WAY OF

　　LIBERALITY, OR IN MAGNIFICENT MANNER, PERFORMED ANY WORTHY

　　ACTION, FOR LOVE, FAVOUR, FRIENDSHIP, OR ANY OTHER

　　HONOURABLE OCCASION

　　Already began certaine small Clouds in the West, to blush with aVermillion tincture, when those in the East (having reached to theirfull heighth) looked like bright burnished Gold, by splendour of theSun beames drawing neere unto them: when Pamphilus being risen, causedthe Ladies, and the rest of his honourable companions to be called.When they were all assembled, and had concluded together on the place,whither they should walke for their mornings recreation: the Kingledde on the way before accompanied with the two Noble LadiesPhilomena and Fiammetta, all the rest following after them,devising, talking, and answering to divers demands both what thatday was to be don, as also concerning the proposed imposition forthe forthcoming day.

　　After they had walked an indifferent space of time, and found therayes of the Sunne to be over-piercing for them: they returned backeagaine to the Pallace, as fearing to have their blood immoderatelyheated. Then rinsing their Glasses in the coole cleare runningcurrent, each tooke their mornings draught, and then walked into themilde shades about the Garden, untill they should bee summoned todinner. Which was no sooner over-past, and such as slept, returnedwaking: they mette together againe in their wonted place, according asthe King had appointed, where he gave command unto Madame Neiphila,that shee should (for that day) begin the first Novell, which shehumbly accepting, thus began.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE FIRST NOVELL

　　WHERIN MAY EVIDENTLY BE DISCERNED, THAT SERVANTS TO PRINCES AND

　　GREAT LORDS, ARE MANY TIMES RECOMPENCED, RATHER BY THEIR GOOD

　　FORTUNE, THEN IN ANY REGARD OF THEIR DUTIFULL SERVICES

　　A Florentine knight, named Signior Rogiero de Figiovanni, became aservant to Alphonso, King of Spaine, who (in his owne opinion)seemed but sleightly to respect and reward him. In regard whereof,by a notable experiment, the King gave him a manifest testimony,that it was not through any defect in him, but onely occasioned by theKnights ill fortune; most bountifully recompencing him afterward.

　　I doe accept it (Worthy Ladies) as no mean favour, that the Kinghath given me the first place, to speake of such an honourableArgument, as Bounty and Magnificence is, which precious Jewell, evenas the Sunne is the beauty, or ornament and bright glory of al heaven;so is bounty and magnificence the Crowne of all vertues. I shallthen recount to you a short Novell, sufficiently pleasing, in mineowne opinion, and I hope (so much I dare rely on your judgements) bothprofitable, and worthy to be remembred.

　　You are to know then, that among other valiant Knights, which oflong have lived in our City, one of them, and (perhappes) of asgreat merit as any, was one, named Signior Rogiero d'Figiovanni. Hebeing rich, of great courage, and perceiving, that (in dueconsideration) the quality belonging to life, and the customesobserved among our Tuscanes, were not answerable to his expectation,nor agreed with the disposition of his valour; determined to leave hisnative Countrey, and belong in service (for some time) to Alfonso,King of Spaine, whose fame was generally noised in all places, forexcelling all other Princes in those times, for respect of mens welldeservings, and bountifull requitall of their paines. Being providedin honorable order, both of Horses, Armes, and a competent train, hetravelled to Spaine, where he was worthily entertained.

　　Signior Rogiero continuing there, living in honorable maner, andperforming many admirable actions of arms; in short time he madehimselfe sufficiently knowne, for a very valiant and famous man. Andhaving remained an indifferent long while, observing divers behavioursin the king: he saw, how enclined himselfe first to one man, thenanother, bestowing on one a Castle, a Towne on another, andBaronnies on divers, som-what indiscreetly, as giving away bountifulto men of no merit. And restraining all his favors from him, asseeming close fisted, and parting with nothing: he took it as adiminishing of his former reputation, and a great empayring of hisfame, wherefore he resolved on his departure thence, and made his suitto the king that he might obtaine it. The king did grant it, bestowingon him one of the very best Mules, and the goodliest that ever wasbackt, a gift most highly pleasing to Rogiero, in regarde of thelong journy he intended to ride. Which being delivcrd, the king gavecharge to one of his Gentlemen, to compasse such convenient meanes, asto ride thorow the country, and in the company of Signior Rogiero, yetin such manner, as he should not perceive, that the King had purposelysent him so to do. Respectively he should observe whatsoever he saidconcerning the king, his gesture, smiles, and other behavior,shaping his answers accordingly, and on the nexte morning to commandhis returne backe with him to the King.

　　Nor was the Gentleman slacke in this command, but noting Rogieroesdeparting forth of the city, he mounted on horseback likewise, andimmediatly after came into his company, making him beleeve, that hejournied towards Italy. Rogiero rode on the Mule which the king hadgiven him, with diversity of speeches passing between them. Aboutthree of the clocke in the afternoone, the Gentleman said. It were notamisse Sir, (having such fit opportunitie), to Stable our horses for awhile, till the heate be a little more overpast. So taking an Inne,and the horses being in the stable, they all staled except the Mule.

　　Being mounted againe, and riding on further, the Gentleman duelyobserved whatsoever Rogiero spake, and comming to the passage of asmall River or Brooke: the rest of the beasts dranke, and not theMule, but staled in the River: which Signior Rogiero seeing,clapping his hands on the Mules mane, hee said. What a wicked beastart thou? thou art just like thy Master that gave thee to mee. TheGentleman committed the words to memory, as he did many otherpassing from Rogiero, riding along the rest of the day, yet none indisparagement of the King, but rather highly in his commendation.And being the next morning mounted on horseback, seeming to hold onstill the way for Tuscane: the Gentleman fulfilled the Kingscommand, causing Signior Rogiero to turne back againe with him,which willingly he yeelded to doe.

　　When they were come to the Court, and the King made acquaintedwith the words, which Rogiero spake to his Mule; he was called intothe presence, where the King shewed him a gracious countenance, anddemanded of him, why he had compared him to his Mule? SigniorRogiero nothing daunted, but with a bold and constant spirit, thusanswered. Sir, I made the comparison, because, like as you give, wherethere is no conveniency, and bestow nothing where reason requireth:even so, the Mule would not stale where she should have done, butwhere was water too much before, there she did it. Beleeve meSignior Rogiero, replyed the King, if I have not given you such gifts,as (perhaps) I have done to divers other, farre inferiour to you inhonour and merit; this happened not thorough any ignorance in me, asnot knowing you to be a most valiant Knight, and well-worthy ofspeciall respect: but rather through your owne ill fortune, whichwould not suffer me to doe it, whereof she is guilty, and not I, asthe truth thereof shall make it selfe apparant to you. Sir, answeredRogiero, I complaine not, because I have received no gift from you, asdesiring thereby covetously to become the richer: but in regard youhave not as yet any way acknowledged, what vertue is remaining inme. Neverthelesse, I allow your excuse for good and reasonable, and amheartely contented, to behold whatsoever you please; although I doeconfidently credit you, without any other testimony.The King conducted him then into the great Hall, where (as hee hadbefore given order) stood two great Chests, fast lockt; in thepresence of all his Lords, the King thus spake. Signior Rogiero, inone of these Chests is mine imperiall Crowne, the Scepter Royall,the Mound, and many more of my richest girdles, rings, plate, andjewels, even the very best that are mine: the other is full of earthonely. Chuse one of these two, and which thou makest election of; uponmy Royall word thou shalt enjoy it. Hereby shalt thou evidentlyperceive, who hath bin ingreatful to the deservings, either I, orthine owne bad fortune. Rogiero seeing it was the kings pleasure tohave it so; chose one of them, which the King caused presently to beopened, it approving to be the same that was full of earth, whereatthe King smyling, said thus unto him. You see Signior Rogiero, thatwhat I said concerning your ill fortune, is very true: butquestionlesse, your valour is of such desert, as I ought to opposemy selfe against all her malevolence. And because I know right, thatyou are not minded to become a Spaniard; I will give you neitherCastle nor dwelling place: but will bestow the Chest on you (in meerdespight of your malicious fortune) which she so unjustly tooke awayfrom you. Carry it home with you into your Countrey, that there it maymake an apparant testimoney, in the sight of all your well-willers,both of your owne vertuous deservings, and my bounty. SigniorRogiero humbly receiving the Chest, and thanking his Majestie for soliberall a gift, returned home joyfully therewith, into his nativeCountrey of Tuscane.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE SECOND NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS DECLARED THAT GOOD MEN DOE SOMETIMES FALL INTO BAD

　　CONDITIONS, ONELY OCCASIONED THERETO BY NECESSITY: AND WHAT

　　MEANES ARE TO BE USED, FOR THEIR REDUCING TO GOODNESSE

　　AGAINE

　　Ghinotto di Tacco; tooke the Lord Abbot of Clugni as his prisoner,and cured him of a grievous disease, which he had in his stomacke, andafterwards set him at libert. The same Lord Abbot when hee returnedfrom the Court Rome, reconciled Ghinotto to Pope Boniface; who madehim a Knight, and Lord Prior of a goodly Hospitall.

　　The magnificence and Royall bounty, which King Alphonso bestowedon the Florentine knight, passed through the whole assembly withmean applause, and the King (who gave the greatest praise of al)commanded Madame Eliza, to take the second turne in order;whereupon, thus she began. Faire Ladies, if a king shewed himselfemagnificently minded, and expressed his liberall bounty to such a man,as had done him good and honourable services: it can be termed no morethen a vertuous deed well done, and becomming a King. But what will wesay, when we heare that a Prelate of the Church, shewed himselfewondrously magnificent, and to such a one as was his enemy: can anymalicious tongue speake ill of him? Undoubtedly, no other answere isto be made, but the action of the King was meerely vertue, and that ofthe Prelate, no lesse then a miracle: for how can it be otherwise,when they are more greedily covetous then women, and deadly enemies toall liberality? And although every man (naturally) desireth revengefor injuries and abuses done unto him: yet men of the Church, inregard that dayly they preached patience, and commaund (above allthings else) remission of sinnes: it would appeare a mighty blemish inthem, to be more froward and furious then other men. But I am tospeake of a reverend Prelate of the Church, as also concerning hismunificent bounty, to one that was his enemy, and yet became hisreconciled friend, as you shall perceive by my Novell.

　　Ghinotto di Tacco, for his insolent and stout robberies, became aman very farre famed, who being banished from Sienna, and an enemyto the Countes Disanta Flore: prevailed so by his bold andheadstrong perswasions, that the Towne of Raticonfani rebelled againstthe Church of Rome, wherein he remaining; all passengers whatsoever,travelling any way thereabout, were robde and rifled by his theevingCompanions. At the time whereof now I speake, Boniface the eight,governed as Pope at Rome, and the Lord Abbot of Clugni (accounted tobe one of the richest Prelates in the world) came to Rome, and thereeither by some surfeit, excesse of feeding, or otherwise, his stomackebeing grievously offended and pained; the Phisitians advised him, totravell to the Bathes at Sienna, where he should receive immediatecure. In which respect, his departure being licenced by the Pope, toset onward thither, with great and pompous Cariages, of Horses, Mules,and a goodly traine, without hearing any rumour of the theevishConsorts.

　　Ghinotto di Tacco, being advertised of his comming, spred abouthis scouts and nettes, and without missing so much as one Page, shutup the Abbot, with all his traine and baggage, in a place of narrowrestraint, out of which he could by no meanes escape. When this wasdone, he sent one of his most sufficient attendants (well accompanyed)to the Lord Abbot, who said to him in his Masters name, that if hisLordship were so pleased, hee might come and visite Ghinotto at hisCastle. Which the Abbot hearing, answered chollerickly, that hewould not come thither, because hee had nothing to say to Ghinotto:but meant to proceed on in his journy, and would faine see, whodurst presume to hinder his passe. To which rough words, the messengerthus mildely answered. My Lord (quoth he) you are arrived in such aplace, where we feare no other force, but the all-controlling power ofheaven, clearely exempted from the Popes thunder-cracks, ofmaledictions, interdictions, excommunications, or whatsoever else: andtherefore it would bee much better for you, if you pleased to do asGhinotto adviseth you.

　　During the time of this their interparlance, the place wassuddenly round ingirt with strongly armed theeves, and the LordAbbot perceiving, that both he and all his followers were surprized:tooke his way (though very impatiently) towards the Castle, andlikewise all his company and carriages with him. Being dismounted, heewas conducted (as Ghinotto had appointed) all alone, into a smallChamber of the Castle, it being very darke and uneasie: but the restof his traine, every one according to his ranck and quality, wereall well lodged in the Castle, their horses, goods and all thingselse, delivered into secure keeping, without the least touch of injuryor prejudice. All which being orderly done, Ghinotto himselfe wentto the Lord Abbot, and said. My Lord, Ghinotto, to whom you are awelcome guest, requesteth, that it might be your pleasure to tell him,whither you are travelling, and upon what occasion?

　　The Lord Abbot being a very wise man, and his angry distemper moremoderately qualified; revealed whither he went, and the cause of hisgoing thither. Which when Ghinotto had heard, hee departed courteouslyfrom him, and began to consider with himselfe, how he might cure theAbbot; yet without any Bathe. So, commanding a good fire to be keptcontinually in his small Chamber, and very good attendance on him: thenext morning, he came to visite him againe, bringing a faire whiteNapkin on his arme, and in it two slices or toasts of fine Manchet,a goodly cleare Glasse, full of the purest white-Bastard ofCorniglia (but indeed, of the Abbots owne provision brought thitherwith him) and then hee spoke to him in this manner.

　　My Lord, when Ghinotto was yonger then now he is, he studyedPhysicke, and he commanded me to tell you, that the very bestmedicine, he could ever learne, against any disease in the stomacke,was this which he had provided for your Lordship, as an especialpreparative, and which he should finde to be very comfortable. TheAbbot, who had a better stomacke to eate, then any will or desire totalke: although hee did it somewhat disdainfully, yet hee eate up boththe toastes, and roundly dranke the Glasse of Bastard. Afterward,divers other speeches passed betweene them, the one still advisingin Phisicall manner, and the other seeming to care little for it:but moved many questions concerning Ghinotto, and earnestly requestingto see him. Such speeches as savoured of the Abbots discontentment,and came from him in passion; were clouded with courteousacceptance, and not the least signe of any mislike: but assuring hisLordship, that Ghinotto intended very shortly to see him, and sothey parted for that time.Nor returned he any more, till the next morning with the like twotoastes of bread, and such another Glasse of white Bastard, as hehad brought him at the first, continuing the same course for diversdayes after: till the Abbot had eaten (and very hungerly too) a prettystore of dryed Beanes, which Ghinotto purposely, (yet secretly) hadhidden in the Chamber. Whereupon he demaunded of him (as seeming to beso enjoyned by his pretended master) in what temper he found hisstomacke now? I should finde my stomacke well enough (answered theLord Abbot) if I could get forth of thy masters fingers, and then havesome good food to feed on: for his medicines have made me so soundlystomackt, that I am ready to starve with hunger.

　　When Ghinotto was gone from him, hee then prepared a very faireChamber for him, adorning it with the Abbots owne rich hangings, asalso his Plate and other moveables, such as were alwayes used forhis service. A costly dinner he provided likewise, whereto heinvited divers of the Towne, and many of the Abbots chiefestfollowers: then going to him againe the next morning, he said. MyLord, seeing you doe feele your stomacke so well, it is time youshould come forth of the Infirmary. And taking him by the hand, hebrought him into the prepared Chamber, where he left him with his ownepeople, and went to give order for the dinners serving in, that itmight be performed in magnificent manner.

　　The Lord Abbot recreated himselfe a while with his owne people, towhom he recounted, the course of his life since hee saw them; and theylikewise told him, how kindly they had bin initeated by Ghinotto.But when dinner time was come, the Lord Abbot and all his company,were served with costly viands and excellent Wines, without Ghinottoesmaking himselfe knowne to the Abbot: till after he had beeneentertained some few dayes in this order: into the great Hall of theCastle, Ghinotto caused all the Abbots goods and furniture to beebrought, and likewise into a spacious Court, wheron the windowes ofthe said Court gazed, all his mules and horses, with their sumpters,even to the very silliest of them, which being done, Ghinotto wentto the Abbot, and demaunded of him, how he felt his stomacke now,and whether it would serve him to venter on horsebacke as yet, orno? The Lord Abbot answered, that he found his stomacke perfectlyrecovered, his body strong enough to endure travell, and all thingswell, so hee were delivered from Ghinotto.

　　Hereupon, he brought him into the hall where his furniture was, asalso all his people, and commanding a window to be opned, wherat hemight behold his horses, he said. My Lord, let me plainely give you tounderstand, that neither cowardise, or basenesse of minde, inducedGhinotto di Tacco (which is my selfe) to become a lurking robber onthe high-wayes, an enemy to the Pope, and so (consequently) to theRomane Court: but onely to save his owne life and honour knowinghimselfe to be a Gentleman cast out of his owne house, and having(beside) infinite enemies. But because you seeme to be a worthyLord, I will not (although I have cured your stomacks disease) dealewith you as I doe to others, whose goods (when they fall into mypower) I take such part of as I please: but rather am wellcontented, that my necessities being considered by your selfe, youspare me out a proportion of the things you have heere, answerableto your owne liking. For all are present here before you, both in thisHall, and in the Court beneath, free from any spoyle, or the leastimpairing. Wherefore, give a part, or take all, if you please, andthen depart hence when you will, or abide heere still, for now you areat your owne free liberty.

　　The Lord Abbot wondred not a little, that a robber on the highwayes, should have such a bold and liberall spirit, which appearedvery pleasing to him; and instantly, his former hatred and spleeneagainst Ghinotto, became converted into cordiall love and kindnes,so that (imbracing him in his armes) he said. I protest upon my vowmade to Religion, that to win the love of such a man, as I plainelyperceive thee to be: I would undergo far greater injuries, thenthose which I have received at thy hands. Accursed be cruelldestiny, that forced thee to so base a kind of life, and did notblesse thee with a fairer fortune. After he had thus spoken, he leftthere the greater part of all his goods, and returned backe againeto Rome, with few horses, and a meaner traine.

　　During these passed accidents, the Pope had received intelligence ofthe Lord Abbots surprizall, which was not a little displeasing to him:but when he saw him returned, he demaunded, what benefit he receivedat the Bathes? Whereto the Abbot, merrily smyling, thus replyed.Holy Father, I met with a most skilfull Physitian neerer hand, whoseexperience is beyond the power of the Bathes, for by him I am veryperfectly cured: and so discoursed all at large. The Pope laughingheartely, and the Abbot continuing on still his report; moved withan high and magnificent courage, he demaunded one gracious favour ofthe Pope: who imagining that he would request a matter of greatermoment, then he did, freely offered to grant, whatsoever he desired.

　　Holy Father, answered the Lord Abbot, all the humble suit which Imake to you, is, that you would be pleased to receive into yourgrace and favor, Ghinotto di Tacco my Physitian, because among all thevertuous men, deserving to have especial account made of them Inever met with any equall to him both in honour and honesty.Whatsoever injury he did to me, I impute it as a greater in-fortune,then any way he deserveth to be charged withall. Which wretchedcondition of his, if you were pleased to alter, and bestow on him somebetter meanes of maintenance, to live like a worthy man, as he is nolesse: I make no doubt, but (in very short time) hee will appeare aspleasing to your holinesse, as (in my best judgement) I thinke himto be.

　　The Pope, who was of a magnanimious spirit, and one that highlyaffected men of vertue, hearing the commendable motion made by theAbbot; returned answere, that he was as willing to grant it, as theother desired it, sending Letters of safe conduct for his commingthither. Ghinotto receiving such assurance from the Court of Rome,came thither immediatly, to the great joy of the Lord Abbot: and thePope finding him to be a man of valor and worth, uponreconciliation, remitted all former errors, creating him knight, andLord Prior of the very chiefest Hospitall in Rome. In which Officehe lived long time after, as a loyall servant to the Church, and anhonest thankefull friend to the Lord Abbot of Clugny.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE THIRD NOVELL

　　SHEWING IN AN EXCELLENT AND LIVELY DEMONSTRATION, THAT ANY

　　ESPECIALL HONOURABLE VERTUE, PERSEVERING AND DWELLING IN A

　　TRULY NOBLE SOULE, CANNOT BE VIOLENCED OR CONFOUNDED, BY THE

　　MOST POLITICKE ATTEMPTES OF MALICE AND ENVY

　　Mithridanes envying the life and liberality of Nathan, andtravelling thither, with a setled resolution to kill him: chaunceth toconferre with Nathan unknowne. And being instructed by him, in whatmanner he might best performe the bloody deede, according as heegave direction, hee meeteth with him in a small Thicket or Woode,where knowing him to be the same man, that taught him how to take awayhis life: Confounded with shame, hee acknowledgeth his horribleintention, and becommeth his loyall friend.

　　It appeared to the whole assembly, that they had heard a matter ofmervaile, for a Lord Abbot to performe any magnificent action: buttheir admiration ceasing in silence, the King commanded Philostratusto follow next, who forthwith thus began.

　　Honourable Ladies, the bounty and magnificense of Alphonso King ofSpaine, was great and that done by the Lord great in Abbot ofClugny, a thing (perhaps) never heard of in any other. But it willseeme no lesse mervailous to you, when you heare, how one man, inexpression of great liberality to another man, that earnestlydesired to kill him; should bee secretly disposed to give him hislife, which had bin lost, if the other would have taken it, as Ipurpose to acquaint you withall, in a short Novell.

　　Most certaine it is, at least, if Faith may bee given to thereport of certaine Genewayes, and other men resorting to thoseremote parts, that in the Country of Cathaya, there lived somtime aGentleman, rich beyond comparison, and named Nathan. He having hisliving adjoyning to a great common rode-way, whereby men travayledfrom the East to the West (as they did the like from the West unto theEast, as having no other means of passage) and being of a bountifulland chearfull disposition, which he was willing to make knowen byexperience: he summoned together many Master Masons and Carpenters,and there erected (in a short time) one of the greatest, goodliest,and most beautifull houses (in manner of a Princes Pallace) thatever was seene in all those quarters.

　　With movables and all kinde of furnishment, befitting a house ofsuch outward apparance, hee caused it to be plentifully stored onelyto receive, entertaine, and honor all Gentlemen or other Travailerswhatsoever, as had occasion to passe that way, being not unprovidedalso of such a number of servants, as might continuallie giveattendance on all commers and goers. Two and fifty severall gates,standing alway wide open, and over each of them in great goldencarracters was written, Welcome, welcome, and gave free admission toall commers whatsoever.

　　In this honourable order (observed as his estated custom) hepersevered so long a while, as not onely the East parts, but alsothose in the west, were every where acquainted with his fame andrenown. Being already well stept into yeares, but yet not wearie(therefore) of his great charge and liberality: it fortuned, thatthe rumor of his noble Hospitality, came to the eare of anothergallant Gentleman, named Mithridanes, living in a Countrey not farreoff from the other.

　　This Gentleman, knowing himselfe no lesse wealthy then Nathan, andenviously repining at his vertue and liberality, determined in hismind, to dim and obscure the others bright splendor, by makinghimselfe farre more famous. And having built a Palace answerable tothat of Nathans, with like windings of gates, and welcom inscriptions;he beganne to extend immeasurable courtesies, unto all such as weredisposed to visite him: so that (in a short while) hee grew veryfamous in infinite places. It chanced on a day, as Mithridanes sateall alone within the goodly Court of his Pallace: a poore woman entredat one of the gates, craving an almes of him, which she had; andreturned in againe at a second gate, comming also to him, and had asecond almes; continuing so still a dozen times; but at the thirteenthreturning, Mithridanes saide to her: Good Woman, you goe and come veryoften, and still you are served with almes. When the old Woman heardthese words, she said. O the liberality of Nathan! How honourableand wonderfull is that? I have past through two and thirty gates ofhis Palace, even such as are here, and at every one I receyved analmes, without any knowledgement taken of me, either by him, or any ofhis followers: and heere I have past but through thirteene gates,and am there both acknowledged and taken. Farewell to this house,for I never meane to visit it any more; with which words shee departedthence, and never after came thither againe.

　　When Mithridanes had a while pondered on her speeches, hee waxedmuch discontented, as taking the words of the olde woman, to extollthe renowne of Nathan, and darken or ecclipse his glorie, whereupon hesaid to himselfe. Wretched man as I am, when shall I attaine to theheight of liberality, and performe such wonders, as Nathan doth? Inseeking to surmount him, I cannot come neere him in the verymeanest. Undoubtedly, I spend all my endeavour but in vaine, exceptI rid the world of him, which (seeing his age will not make an endof him) I must needs do with my own hands. In which furious and bloodydetermination (without revealing his intent to any one) he mountedon horse-backe, with few attendants in his company, and after threedayes journey, arrived where Nathan dwelt. He gave order to his men,to make no shew of beeing his servants, or any way to acknowledge him:but to provide them selves of convenient lodgings, untill they heardother tydings from him.

　　About Evening, and (in this manner) alone by himselfe, neere tothe Palace of Nathan, he met him solitarily walking, not in pompousapparrell, whereby to bee distinguished from a meaner man: and,because he knew him not, neyther had heard any relation of hisdescription, he demanded of him, if he knew where Nathan then was?Nathan, with a chearfull countenance, thus replyed. Faire Syr, thereis no man in these parts, that knoweth better how to shew you Nathanthen I do; and therefore, if you be so pleased, I will bring you tohim. Mithridanes said, therein he should do him a great kindnesse:albeit (if it were possible) he would bee neyther knowne nor seeneof Nathan. And that (quoth he) can I also do sufficiently for you,seeing it is your will to have it so, if you will goe along with me.

　　Dismounting from his horse, he walked on with Nathan, diverslydiscoursing, untill they came to the Pallace, where one of theservants taking Mithridanes his horse, Nathan rounded the fellow inthe eare, that he should give warning to al. throughout the House, forrevealing to the Gentleman, that he was Nathan; as accordingly itwas performed. No sooner were they within the Pallace, but heconducted Mithridanes into a goodly chamber, wher none (as yet) hadseene him, but such as were appointed to attend on him reverently;yea, and he did himselfe greatly honor him, as being loth to leave hiscompany.

　　While thus Mithridanes conversed with him, he desired to know(albeit he respected him much for his yeares) what he was. Introthsir, answered Nathan, I am one of the meanest servants to Nathan,and from my child-hood, have made my selfe thus olde in his service:yet never hath he bestowed any other advancement on mee, then as younow see; in which respect, howsoever other men may commend him, yetI have no reason at all to do it. These Words, gave some hope toMithridanes, that with a little more counsell, he might securely putin execution his wicked determination. Nathan likewise demaunded ofhim (but in very humble manner) of whence, and what he was, as alsothe businesse inviting him thither: offering him his utmost aide andcounsell, in what soever consisted in his power.

　　Mithridanes sat an indifferent while meditating with his thoghtsbefore ie would returne any answer: but at the last, concluding torepose confidence in him (in regard of his pretended discontentment)with many circumstantial perswasions, first for fidelity, next forconstancie, and lastly for counsell and assistance, he declared to himtruly what he was, the cause of his comming thither, and the reasonurging him thereto. Nathan hearing these words, and the detestabledeliberation of Mithridanes, became quite changed in himself: yetwisely making no outward appearance thereof, with a bold courage andsetled countenance, thus he replyed.

　　Mithridanes, thy Father was a Noble Gentleman, and (in vertuousqualities) inferiour to none, from whom (as now I see) thou desirestnot to degenerate, having undertaken so bold and high an enterprise, Imeane, in being liberall and bountifull to all men. I do greatlycommend the envy which thou bearest to the vertue of Nathan: becauseif there were many more such men, the world that is now wretched andmiserable, would become good and conformable. As for the determinationwhich thou hast disclosed to mee, I have sealed it up secretly in mysoule: wherein I can better give thee counsell, then any especiallhelpe or furtherance: and the course which I would have thee toobserve, followeth thus in few words.

　　This window, which we now looke forth at, sheweth thee a smal woodor thicket of trees, being litle more then the quarter of a milesdistance hence; whereto Nathan usually walketh every morning, andthere continueth time long enough: there maist thou very easily meethim, and do whatsoever thou intendest to him. If thou kilst him,because thou maist with safety returne home unto thine owne abiding,take not the same way which guided thee thither, but another, lying onthe left hand, and directing speedily out of the wood, as being not somuch haunted as the other, but rather free from all resort, and surestfor visiting thine owne countrey, after such a dismall deed is done.

　　When Mithridanes had receyved this instruction, and Nathan wasdeparted from him; hee secretly gave intelligence to his men, (wholikewise were lodged, as welcom strangers, in the same house) atwhat place they should stay for him the next morning. Night beingpassed over, and Nathan risen, his heart altred not a jot from hiscounsel given to Mithridanes, much lesse changed from anie partthereof: but all alone by himselfe, walked on to the wood, the placeappointed for his death. Mithridanes also being risen, taking hisBow and Sword (for other weapons had he none) mounted on horsbacke,and so came to the wood, where (somewhat farre off) hee espyedNathan walking, and no creature with him. Dismounting from hishorse, he had resolved (before he would kill him) not onely to see,but also to heare him speake: so stepping roughly to him, and takinghold of the bonnet on his head, his face being then turned from him,he sayde. Old man, thou must dye. Whereunto Nathan made no otheranswer, but thus: Why then (belike) I have deserved it.

　　When Mithridanes heard him speake, and looked advisedly on his face,he knew him immediately to be the same man, that had entertained himso lovingly, conversed with him so familiarly, and counselled him sofaithfully: all which overcomming his former fury, his harsh naturebecame meerly confounded with shame: So throwing downe his drawnesword, which he held readily prepared for the deede: he prostratedhimselfe at Nathans feet, and in teares, spake in this manner. Nowdo I manifestly know (most loving Father) your admired bounty andliberalitie; considering, with what industrious providence, you madethe meanes for your comming hither, prodigally to bestow your lifeon me, which I have no right unto, although you were so willing topart with it. But those high and supreame powers, more carefull ofmy dutie, then I my selfe: even at the very instant, and when it wasmost needfull, opened the eyes of my better understanding, whichinternall envy had closed up before. And therefore, looke how much youhave bin forward to pleasure me; so much the more shame andpunishment, I confesse my heinous transgression hath justlydeserved: take therefore on me (if you please) such revenge, as youthinke (in justice) answerable to my sin.

　　Nathan lovingly raised Mithridanes from the ground, then kissing hischeeke, and tenderly embracing him, he said. Sonne, thou needest notto aske, much less to obtaine pardon, for any enterprise of thine,which thou canst not yet terme to be good or bad: because thousoughtest not to bereave me of my life, for any hatred thou barest me,but onely in coveting to be reputed the Woorthier man. Take thenthis assurance of me, and beleeve it constantly, that there is noman living, whom I love and honour, as I do thee: considering thegreatnesse of thy minde, which consisteth not in the heaping up ofmoney, as wretched and miserable Worldlings make it their onelyfelicity; but, contending in bounty to spend what is thine, didst holdit for no shame to kil me, thereby to make thy selfe so much themore worthily famous.

　　Nor is it any matter to be wondred at, in regard that Emperors,and the greatest Kings, hadde never made such extendure of theirDominions, and consequently of their renowne, by any other Art, thenkilling; yet not one man onely, as thou wouldst have done: butinfinite numbers, burning whole Countries, and making desolate hugeTownes and Cities, onely to enlarge their dominion, and furtherspreading of their fame. Wherefore, if for the increasing of thineowne renowne, thou wast desirous of my death: it is no matter ofnovelty, and therefore deserving the lesse mervaile, seeing men areslaine daily, and all for one purpose or other.

　　Mithridanes, excusing no further his malevolent deliberation, butrather commending the honest defence, which Nathan made on hisbehalfe; proceeded so farre in after discoursing, as to tel himplainely, that it did wondrously amaze him, how he durst come to thefatall appointed place, himselfe having so exactly plotted andcontrived his owne death: whereunto Nathan returned this aunswere.

　　I would not have thee Mithridanes, to wonder at my counsel ordetermination; because, since age hath made mee Maister of mine ownewill, and I resolved to doe that, wherein thou hast begun to followme: never came any man to mee, whom I did not content (if I could)in any thing he demanded of me. It was thy fortune to come for mylife, which when I saw thee so desirous to have it, I resolvedimmediately to bestow it on thee: and so much the rather, because thoushouldst not be the onely man, that ever departed hence, withoutenjoying whatsoever hee demanded. And, to the end thou mightst themore assuredly have it, I gave thee that advice, least by not enjoyingmine, thou shouldest chance to loose thine owne. I have had the use ofit full fourescore yeares, with the consummation of all my delightsand pleasures: and well I know, that according to the course of Nature(as it fares with other men, and generally all things else) itcannot bee long before it must leave mee.

　　Wherefore, I hold it much better for me to give it away freely, as Ihave alwayes done my goods and treasure; then bee curious in keepingit, and suffer it to be taken from me (whether I will or no) byNature. A small gift it is, if time make me up the full summe of anhundred yeares: how miserable is it then, to stand beholding but forfoure or five, and all of them vexation too? Take it then I intreatethee, if thou wilt have it; for I never met with any man before (butthy selfe) that di desire it, nor (perhaps) shall finde any other torequest it: for the longer I keepe it, the worse it wil be esteemed:and before it grow contemptible, take it I pray thee.

　　Mithridanes, being exceedingly confounded with shame, bashfullysayde: Fortune fore-fend, that I should take away a thing soprecious as your life is, or once to have so vile a thought of it aslately I had; but rather then I would diminish one day thereof, Icould wish, that my time might more amply enlarge it. Forthwithaunswered Nathan, saying. Wouldst thou (if thou couldst) shorten thineowne dayes, onely to lengthen mine? Why then thou wouldest have meto do that to thee, which (as yet) I never did unto any man, namely,robbe thee, to enrich my selfe. I will enstruct thee in a muchbetter course, if thou wilt be advised by mee. Lusty and young, as nowthou art, thou shalt dwell heere in my house, and be called by thename of Nathan. Aged, and spent with yeares, as thou seest I am, Iwill goe live in thy house, and bee called by the name of Mithridanes.So, both the name and place shall illustrate thy Glorie, and I livecontentedly, without the very least thought of envie.

　　Deare Father, answered Mithridanes, if I knew so well howe to directmine owne actions, as you doe, and alwayes have done, I would gladlyaccept your most liberall offer: but because I plainlie perceive, thatmy very best endeavours, must remayne darkened by the bright renowneof Nathan: I will never seeke to impayre that in another, which Icannot (by any means) increase in my selfe, but (as you haveworthily taught me) live contented with my owne condition.

　　After these, and many more like loving speeches had passed betweenthem; according as Nathan very instantly requested, Mithridanesreturned back with him to the Pallace, where many dayes he highlyhonored and respected him, comforting and counselling him, to perseveralwayes in his honourable determination. But in the end, whenMithridanes could abide there no longer, because necessary occasionscalled him home: he departed thence with his men, having found by goodexperience, that hee could never goe beyond Nathan in liberality.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE FOURTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS SHEWNE, THAT TRUE LOVE HATH ALWAYES BIN, AND SO STILL

　　IS, THE OCCASION OF MANY GREAT AND WORTHY COURTESIES

　　Signior Gentile de Carisendi, being come from Modena, took aGentlewoman, named Madam Catharina, forth of a grave, wherin she wasburied for dead: which act he did, in regard of his former honestaffection to the said Gentlewoman. Madame Catharina remaining thereafterward, and delivered of a goodly Sonne: was (by Signior Gentile)delivered to her owne Husband, named Signior NicoluccioCaccianimico, and the yong infant with her.

　　By judgment of all the honorable assembly, it was reputedwonderfull, that a man should be so bountifull, as to give away hisowne life, and to his hatefull enemy. In which respect, it passed withgenerall affirmation, that Nathan (in the vertue of liberallity) hadexceeded Alphonso, King of Spain, but (especially) the Abbot ofClugny. So, after every one had delivered their opinion, the King,turning himselfe to Madame Lauretta, gave her such a signe, as wellinstructed her understanding, that she should be the next in order,whereto she gladly yeelding, began in this manner.

　　Youthfull Ladies, the discourses already past, have been so worthyand magnificent, yea, reaching to such a height of glorious splendour;as (me thinkes) there remaineth no more matter, for us that are yet tospeake, whereby to enlarge so famous an Argument, and in such manneras it ought to be: except we lay hold on the actions of love,wherein is never any want of subject, it is so faire and spacious afield to walke in. Wherefore, as well in behalfe of the one, asadvancement of the other, whereto our instant age is most of allinclined: I purpose to acquaint you with a generous and magnificentact, of an amourous Gentleman, which when it shall be duely consideredon, perhaps will appeare equall to any of the rest. At least, if itmay passe for currant, that men may give away their treasures, forgivemighty injuries, and lay downe life it selfe, honour and renowne(which is farre greater) to infinite dangers, only to attaine anything esteemed and affected.

　　Understand then (Gracious hearers) that in Bologna, a very famousCity of Lombardicy there lived sometime a Knight, most highlyrespected for his vertues, named Signior Gentile de Carisendi, who (inhis yonger dayes) was enamoured of a Gentlewoman, called MadamCatharina, the Wife of Signior Nicoluccio Caccianimico. And becauseduring the time of his amourous pursuite, he found but a sorryenterchange of affection from the Lady; hee went (as hopelesse ofany successe) to be Potestate of Modena, whereto he was called byplace and order.

　　At the same time, Signior Nicoluccio being absent from Bologna,and his Lady at a Farme-house of his in the Countrey (about threemiles distant from the City) because she was great with child,; andsomewhat neere the time of her teeming: it came to passe, that somedangerous accident befell her, which was so powerfull in operation, asno signe of life appeared remained in her, but she was reputed (evenin the judgement of the best Phisitians, whereof she wanted noattendance) to be verily dead. And because in the opinion of herparents and neerest kinred, the time for her deliverance was yet sofarre off, as the Infant within her, wanted much of a perfectcreature: they made the lesse mourning; but in the next Church, asalso the vault belonging to her Ancestors, they gave her buriallvery speedily.

　　Which tydings comming to the hearing of Signior Gentile, by one thatwas his endeared friend: Although (while she lived) he could neverbe gracious n her favour, yet her so sudden death did greatly grievehim, whereupon he discoursed in this sort with himselfe. DeareMadame Catharina, I am not a little sorry for thy death, although(during thy life-time) I was scarcely worthy of one kind looke: Yetnow being dead, thou canst not prohibite me, but I may robbe thee of akisse. No sooner had hee spoke the words, but it beeing then night,and taking such order, as none might know of his departure: heemounted on horsebacke, accompanied onely with one servant, andstayed no where, till hee came to the vault where the Lady was buried.Which when he had opened, with instruments convenient for the purpose,he descended downe into the vault, and kneeled downe by the Beerewhereon she lay, and in her wearing garments, according to theusuall manner; with teares trickling mainly downe his cheekes, hebestowed infinite sweet kisses on her.

　　But as we commonly see, that mens desires are never contented, butstill will presume on further advantages, especially such as loveentirely: so fared it with Gentile, who being once minded to get himgone, as satisfied with the oblation of his kisses; would needs yetstep backe againe, saying. Why should I not touch her yvory breast,the Adamant that drew all desires to adore her? Ah let me touch itnow, for never hereafter can I bee halfe so happy. Overcome withthis alluring appetite, gently he laid his hand upon her breast,with the like awefull respect, as if she were living, and holding itso an indifferent while: either he felt, or his imagination soperswaded him, the heart of the Lady to beate and pant. Casting offall fond feare, and the warmth of his increasing the motion: hisinward soule assured him, that she was not dead utterly, but hadsome small sense of life remaining in her, whereof he would needs befurther informed.

　　So gently as possible he could, and with the helpe of his man, hetooke her forth of the monument, and layingher softly on his horsebefore him, conveighed her closely to his house in Bologna. SigniorGentile had a worthy Lady to his Mother, a woman of great wisdomeand vertue, who understanding by her Sonne, how matters hadhappened, moved with compassion, and suffering no one in the houseto know what was done, made a good fire, and very excellent Bathe,which recalled back againe wrongwandering life. Then fetching avehement sigh, opening her eyes, and looking very strangly abouther, she said. Alas! where am I now? whereto the good old Ladykindly replyed, saying. Comfort your selfe Madame, for you are in agood place.

　　Her spirits being in better manner met together, and she stillgazing every way about her, not knowing well where she was, and secingSignior Gentile standing before her: he entreated his mother to tellher by what meanes she came thither; which the good old Lady did,Gentile himselfe helping to relate the whole history. A while shegrieved and lamented, but afterward gave them most hearty thankes,humbly requesting, that, in regard of the love he had formerly borneher, in his house she might finde no other usage, varying from thehonour of her selfe and her Husband, and when day was come, to beconveighed home to her owne house. Madame, answered Signior Gentile,whatsoever I sought to gaine from you in former dayes, I nevermeane, either here, or any where else, to motion any more. Butseeing it hath been my happy fortune, to prove the blessed means ofreducing you from death to life: you shal find no otherentertainment here, then as if you were mine owne Sister. And yetthe good deed which I have this night done for you doth welldeserve some courteous requitall: in which respect, I would have younot to deny me one favour, which I will presume to crave of you.Whereto the Lady lovingly replyed, that she was willing to grant it;provided, it were honest, and in her power: whereto Signior Gentilethus answered.

　　Madame, your parents, kindred and friends, and generally allthroughout Bologna, doe verily thinke you to be dead, whereforethere is not any one, that will make any inquisition after you: inwhich regard, the favour I desire from you, is no more but to abidehere secretly with my Mother, untill such time as I returne fromModena, which shall be very speedily. The occasion why I move thismotion, aymeth at this end, that in presence of the chiefest personsof our City, I may make a gladsome present of you to your Husband. TheLady knowing her selfe highly beholding to the Knight, and the requesthe made to be very honest: disposed her selfe to doe as he desired(although she earnestly longed, to glad her parents and kindred withseeing her alive) and made her promise him on her faith, to effectit in such manner, as he pleased to appoint and give her direction.

　　Scarcely were these words concluded, but she felt the custome ofwomen to come upon her, with the paines and throwes incident tochilding: wherefore, with helpe of the aged Lady, Mother to SigniorGentile, it was not long before her deliverance of a goodly Sonne,which greatly augmented the joy of her and Gentile, who tooke order,that all things belonging to a woman in such a case, were not wanting,but she was as carefully respected, even as if she had been his owneWife. Secretly he repaired to Modena, where having given direction forhis place of authority; he returned back againe to Bologna, andthere made preparation for a great and solemne feast, appointing whoshould be his invited guests, the very chiefest persons in Bologna,and (among them) Signior Nicoluccio Caccianimico the especiall man.

　　After he was dismounted from horsebacke, and found so good companyattending for him (the Lady also, more faire and healthful thenever, and the Infant lively disposed) he sate downe at the Tablewith his guests, causing them to be served in most magnificent manner,with plenty of all delicates that could be devised, and never beforewas there such a joviall feast. About the ending of dinner, closely hemade the Lady acquainted with his further intention, and likewise inwhat order every thing should be done, which being effected, hereturned to his company, and used these speeches.

　　Honourable friends, I remember a discourse sometime made unto me,concerning the Countrey of Persia, and a kind of custome thereobserved, not to be misliked in mine opinion. When any one intended tohonour his friend in effectuall manner, he invited him home to hishouse, and there would shew him the thing, which with greatest love hedid respect; were it Wife, Friend, Sonne, Daughter, or any thingelse whatsoever; wherewithall hee spared not to affirme, that as heshewed him those choyce delights, the like view he should have ofhis heart, if with any possibility it could be done; and the very samecustome I meane now to observe here in our City. You have vouchsafedto honour me with your presence, at this poore homely dinner ofmine, and I will welcome you after the Persian manner, in shewingyou the jewell, which (above all things else in the world) I ever havemost respectively esteemed. But before I doe it, I crave yourfavourable opinions in a doubt, which I will plainely declare untoyou.

　　If any man having in his house a good and faithfull servant, whofalling into extremity of sickenesse, shall be throwne forth intothe open street, without any care or pitty taken on him: A strangerchanceth to passe by, and (moved with compassion of his weakenesse)carryeth him home to his owne house, where using all charitable andnot sparing any cost, he recovereth the sicke person to his formerhealth. I now desire to know, if keeping the said restored person, andimploying him about his owne businesse: the first Master (bypretending his first right) may lawfully complaine of the second,and yeeld him backe againe to the first master, albeit he doe makechallenge of him?

　　All the Gentlemen, after many opinions passing among them, agreedaltogether in one sentence, and gave charge to Signior NicoluccioCaccianimico, (because he was an excellent and elegant speaker) togive answere for them all. First, he commended the custome observed inPersia, saying, he jumpt in opinion with all the rest, that thefirst Master had no right at all to the servant, having not onely(in such necessity) forsaken him, but also cast him forth into thecomfortlesse street. But for the benefits and mercy extended to him;it was more then manifest, that the recovered person, was becomejustly servant to the second Master, and in detayning him from thefirst, hee did not offer him any injury at all. The whole Companysitting at the Table (being all very wise and worthy men) gave theirverdict likewise with the confession of Signior NicoluccioCaccianimico. Which answere did not a little please the Knight; and somuch the rather, because Nicoluccio had pronounced it, affirminghimselfe to be of the same minde.

　　So, sitting in a pretended musing a while, at length he said. Myhonourable guests, it is now more then high time, that I should doeyou such honour, as you have most justly deserved, by performing thepromise made unto you. Then calling two of his servants, he sentthem to Madame Catharina (whom he had caused to adorne her self inexcellent manner) entreating her, that she would be pleased to gracehis guests with her presence. Catharina, having deckt her child incostly habiliments, layed it in her armes, and came with theservants into the dyning Hall, and sate down (as the Knight hadappointed) at the upper end of the Table, and then Signior Gentilespake thus. Behold, worthy Gentlemen, this is the jewell which Ihave most affected, and intend to love none other in the world; be youmy judges, whether I have just occasion to doe so, or no? TheGentlemen saluting her with respective reverence, said to theKnight; that he had great reason to affect her: And viewing heradvisedly, many of them thought her to be the very same woman (asindeed she was) but that they beleeved her to be dead.

　　But above all the rest, Nicoluccio Caccianimico could never besatisfied with beholding her; and, enflamed with earnest desire, toknow what she was, could not refraine (seeing the Knight was goneout of the roome) but demaunded of her, whether she were of Bologna,or a stranger? when the Lady heard her selfe to be thus questioned,and by her Husband, it seemed painefull to her, to containe fromanswering: Neverthelesse, to perfect the Knights intended purpose, shesate silent. Others demaunded of her, whether the sweet Boy were hers,or no; and some questioned, if she were Gentiles Wife, or no, orelse his Kinsewoman; to all which demaunds, she returned not anyanswere. But when the Knight came to them againe, some of them said tohim. Sir, this woman is a goodly creature, but she appeareth to bedumbe, which were great pitty, if it should be so. Gentlemen (quothhe) it is no small argument of her vertue, to sit still and silentat this instant. Tell us then (said they) of whence, and what sheis. Therein (quoth he) I will quickely resolve you, upon yourconditionall promise: that none of you do remove from his place,whatsoever shall be said or done, untill I have fully delivered myminde. Every one bound himselfe by solemne promise, to perform what hehad appointed, and the Tables being voided, as also the Carpetslaid; then the Knight (sitting downe by the Lady) thus began.

　　Worthy Gentlemen, this Lady is that true and faithfull servant,wherof I moved the question to you, whom I tooke out of the coldstreet, where her parents, kindred and friends (making no account atall of her) threw her forth, as a thing vile and unprofitable.Neverthelesse, such hath been my care and cost, that I have rescuedher out of deaths griping power; and, in a meere charitabledisposition, which honest affection caused me to beare her; of a body,full of terror and affrighting (as then she was) I have caused herto become thus lovely as you see. But because you may moreapparantly discerne, in what manner this occasion happened; I will layit open to you in more familiar manner. Then he began the wholehistory, from the originall of his unbeseeming affection to her (inregard she was a worthy mans wife) and consequently, how all hadhappened to the instant houre, to the no meane admiration of all thehearers, adding withall. Now Gentlemen (quoth he) if you varry notfrom your former opinion, and especially Signior NicoluccioCaccianimico: this Lady (by good right) is mine, and no man els by anyjust title, can lay any claime to her.

　　All sate silent, without answering one word, as expecting what heintended further to say: but in the meane while, Nicoluccio, theparents and kindred, but chiefely the Lady her selfe, appeared ashalfe melted into teares with weeping. But Signior Gentile, startingup from the Table, taking the Infant in his arme, and leading the Ladyby the hand, going to Nicoluccio, thus spake. Rise Sir, I will notgive thee thy wife, whom both her kindred and thine, threw forthinto the street: but I will bestow this Lady on thee, being my Gossip,and this sweet Boy my God-sonne, who was (as I am verily perswaded)begotten by thee, I standing witnesse for him at the Font of Baptisme,and give him mine owne name Gentile. Let me entreat thee, that,although she hath lived here in mine house, for the space of threemonethes, she should not be lesse welcome to thee, then before: forI sweare to thee upon my soule, that my former affection to her (howunjust soever) was the onely meanes of preserving her life: and morehonestly she could not live, with Father, Mother, or thy selfe, thenshe hath done here with mine owne Mother.

　　Having thus spoken, he turned to the Lady, saying. Madame, I nowdischarge you of all promises made me, delivering you to yourHusband franke and free: And when he had given him the Lady, and thechild in his armes, he returned to his place, and sate downe againe.Nicoluccio, with no meane joy and hearty contentment received both hiswife and childe, being before farre from expectation of such anadmirable comfort; returning the Knight infinite thankes (as all therest of the Company pany the like) who could not refraine from weepingfor meere joy, for such a strange and wonderful accident: every onehighly commending Gentile, and such also as chanced to hearethereof. The Lady was welcommed home to her owne house, with manymoneths of joviall feasting, and as she passed through the streets,all beheld her with admiration, to be so happily recovered from hergrave Signior Gentile lived long after, a loyall friend toNicoluccio and his Lady, and all that were well-willers to them.

　　What thinke you now Ladies? Can you imagine, because a King gaveaway his Crowne and Scepter; and an Abbot (without any cost tohimselfe) reconciled a Malefactor to the Pope; and an oldidle-headed man, yeelding to the mercy of his enemy: that all thoseactions are comparable to this of Signior Gentile? Youth and ardentaffection, gave him a just and lawfull title, to her who was free(by imagined death) from Husband, Parents, and all friends else, shebeing so happily wonne into his owne possession. Yet honestly notonely overswayed the heate of desire, which in many men is violent andimmoderate: but with a bountifull and liberall soule, that which hecoveted beyond all hopes else, and had within his owne command; hefreely gave away. Beleeve me (bright Beauties) not any of the other(in a true and unpartiall judgement ) are worthy to be equalled withthis, or stiled by the name of magnificent actions.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE FIFT NOVELL

　　ADMONISHING ALL LADIES AND GENTLEWOMEN, THAT ARE DESIROUS TO

　　PRESERVE THEIR CHASTITY, FREE FROM ALL BLEMISH AND TAXATION: TO

　　MAKE NO PROMISE OF YEELDING TO ANY, UNDER A COMPACT OR

　　COVENANT, HOW IMPOSSIBLE SOEVER IT MAY SEEME TO BE

　　Madame Dianora, the Wife of Signior Gilberto, being immodestlyaffected by Signior Ansaldo, to free her selfe from his tediousimportunity, she appointed him to performe (in her judgement) an actof impossibility; namely, to give her a Garden, as plentifullystored with fragrant Flowers in January, as in the flourishingmoneth of May. Ansaldo, by meanes of a bond which he made to aMagitian, performed her request. Signior Gilberto, the Ladyes Husband,gave consent, that his Wife should fulfill her promise made toAnsaldo. Who hearing the bountifull mind of her Husband; releasedher of her promise: And the Magitian likewise discharged SigniorAnsaldo, without taking any thing of him.

　　Not any one in all the Company, but extolled the worthy Act ofSignior Gentile to the skies; till the King gave command to MadameAemillia, that she should follow next with her Tale, who boldlystepping up, began in this order.

　　Gracious Ladies, I thinke there is none heere present among us,but (with good reason) may maintaine, that Signiour Gentileperformed a magnificent deede; but whosoever saith, it is impossibleto do more; perhaps is ignorant in such actions, as can and may bedone, as I meane to make good unto you, by a Novell not overlong ortedious.

　　The Countrey of Fretulium, better knowne by the name of Forum Julij;although it be subject to much cold, yet it is pleasant, in regardof many goodly Mountaines, Rivers, and cleare running Springs,wherewith it is not meanly stored. Within those Territories, is a Citycalled Udina, where sometime lived a faire and Noble Lady, namedMadame Dianora, WiFe to a rich and woorthie Knight, called SigniorGilberto, a man of very great fame and merite.

　　This beautiful Lady, beeing very modest and vertuously inclined, washighly affected by a Noble Baron of those parts, tearmed by the nameof Signior Ansaldo Gradense; a man of very great spirit, bountifull,active in Armes, and yet very affable and courteous, which causedhim to be the better respected. His love to this Lady wasextraordinary, hardly to bee contained within any moderate compasse,striving to bee in like manner affected of her: to which end, shewanted no daily solicitings, Letters, Ambassages and Love-tokens,all proving to no purpose.

　　This vertuous Lady, being wearied with his often temptations, andseeing, that by denying whatsoever he demanded, yet he wold not giveover his suite, but so much the more importunatly stil pursued her:began to bethinke her selfe, how she might best be rid of him, byimposing some such taske upon him, as should bee impossible (in heropinion) for him to effect. An olde woman, whom hee imployed for hiscontinual messenger to her, as shee came one day about her ordinaryerrand, with her she communed in this manner. Good woman (quoth she)thou hast so often assured me, that Signior Ansaldo loveth me aboveall other Women in the world, offering me wonderfull gifts andpresents in his name, which I have alwayes refused, and so stil wildo, in regard I am not to be woon by any such allurements: yet if Icould be soundly perswaded, that his affection is answerable to thyperemptory protestations, I shoulde (perhaps) be the sooner wonne,to listen to his suite in milder manner, then hitherto I have done.Wherefore, if he wil give me assurance, to perform such a businesse asI mean to enjoyne him, he shall the speedier heare better answerfrom me, and I wil confirme it with mine oath.

　　Wonderfully pleased was Mistresse Maquerella, to heare a reply ofsuch comfortable hope; and therefore desired the Lady, to tel hir whatshe wold have done. Listen to me wel (answerd Madam Dianora) thematter which I would have him to effect for me, is; without the walsof our City, and during the month of Januarie nexte ensuing, toprovide me a Garden, as fairely furnished with all kind of fragrantflowers, as the flourishing month of May can yeelde no better. If hebe not able to accomplish this imposition, then I command him, neverhereafter to solicite me any more, either by thee, or any otherwhatsoever: for, if he do importune me afterward, as hitherto I haveconcealed his secret conspiring, both from my husband, and all myfriends; so wil I then lay his dishonest suite open to the world, thathe may receive punishment accordingly, for offering to wrong aGentleman in his wife.

　　When Signior Ansaldo heard her demand, and the offer besidethereuppon made him (although it seemed no easie matter, but a thingmeerly impossible to be done) he considered advisedly, that she madethis motion to no other end, but onely to bereave him of all his hope,ever to enjoy what so earnestly hee desired: neverthelesse, he wouldnot so give it utterly over, but would needs approve what could bedone. Heereupon, hee sent into divers partes of the world, to find outany one that was able to advise him in this doubtfull case. In theend, one was brought to him, who beeing well recompenced for hispaines, by the Art of Nigromancie would under take to do it. Withhim Signior Ansaldo covenanted, binding himselfe to pay a greatsumme of mony, upon performance of so rare a deed, awaiting (inhopefull expectation) for the month of januaries comming. It beingcome, and the weather then in extreamity of cold, every beingcovered with ice and snow, the Magitian prevailed so by his Art,that after the Christmas Holy dayes were past, and the Calends ofjanuary entred: in one night, and without the Cittie Wals, thegoodliest Garden of flowers and fruites, was sodainely sprung up, as(in opinion of such as beheld it) never was the like seen before.Now Ladies, I think I need not demand the question, whether SigniorAnsaldo were wel pleased, or no, who going to beholde t, saw it mostplenteously stored, with al kind of fruit trees, flowers, herbes andplants, as no one could be named, that was wanting in this artificiallgarden. And having gathered some pretty store of them, secretly hesent them to Madam Dianora, inviting hir to come see her Garden,perfected according to her owne desire, and uppon view thereof, toconfesse the integrity of his love to her; considering andremembring withall, the promise shee had made him under solemneoath, that she might be reputed for a woman of her word.

　　When the Lady beheld the fruites and flowers, and heard many otherthinges recounted, so wonderfully growing in the same Garden: began torepent her rash promise made; yet notwithstanding her repentance, asWomen are covetous to see all rarities; so, accompanied with diversLadies and Gentlewomen more, she went to see the Garden; and havingcommended it with much admiration, she returned home againe, themost sorrowfull Woman as ever lived, considering what she had tyed herselfe to, for enjoying this Garden. So excessive grew her griefe andaffliction, that it could not be so clouded or concealed: but herHusband tooke notice of it, and would needs understand the occasionthereof. Long the Lady (in regard of shame and modesty) sate withoutreturning any answer; but being in the end constrained, she disclosdthe whol History to him.

　　At the first, Signior Gilberto waxed exceeding angry, but when hefurther considered withall, the pure and honest intention of his Wife;wisely he pacified his former distemper, and saide. Dianora, it is notthe part of a wise and honest woman, to lend an eare to ambassagesof such immodest nature, much lesse to compound or make agreementfor her honesty, with any person, under any condition whatsoever.Those perswasions which the heart listeneth to, by allurement of theeare, have greater power then many do imagine, and nothing is souneasie or difficult, but in a lovers judgement it appeareth possible.Ill didst thou therefore first of all to listen, but worse (afterward)to contract.

　　But, because I know the purity of thy soule, I wil yeelde (todisoblige thee of thy promise) as perhaps no wise man else would do:mooved thereto onely by feare of the Magitian, who seeing SigniorAnsaldo displeased, because thou makest a mockage of him; will do somesuch violent wrong to us, as we shal be never able to recover.Wherefore, I would have thee go to Signior Ansaldo, and if thoucanst (by any meanes) obtaine of him, the safe-keeping of thyhonour, and ful discharge of thy promise; it shal be an eternallfame to thee, and the crowne of a most victorious conquest. But ifit must needs be otherwise, lend him thy body onely for once, butnot thy wil: for actions committed by constraint, wherein the willis no way guilty, are halfe pardonable by the necessity.

　　Madame Dianora, hearing her husbands words, wept exceedingly, andavouched, that shee had not deserved any such especiall grace ofhim, and therefore she would rather dye, then doe it. Neverthelesse,it was the wil of her Husband to have it so, and therefore (againsther wil) she gave consent. The next morning, by the breake of day,Dianora arose, and attiring her selfe in her very meanest garments,with two servingmen before her, and a waiting Woman following, shewent to the lodging of Signior Ansaldo, who hearing that Madam Dianorawas come to visite him, greatly mervailed, and being risen, hecalled the Magitian to him, saying. Come go with me, and see whateffect will follow upon thine Art. And being come into her presence,without any base or inordinate appetite, he did her humblereverence, embracing her honestly, and taking her into a goodlyChamber, where a faire fire was readilie prepared, causing her tosit downe by him, he sayde unto her as followeth.

　　Madam, I humbly intreat you to resolve me, if the affection I havelong time borne you, and yet do stil, deserve any recompence at all:you would be pleased then to tel me truly, the occasion of yourinstant comming hither, and thus attended as you are. Dianora,blushing with modest shame, and the teares trickling mainly down herfaire cheekes, thus answered. Signior Ansaldo, not for any Love Ibeare you, or care of my faithfull promise made to you, but onely bythe command of my husband (who respecting more the paynes and trave ofyour inordinate love, then his owne reputation and honor, or mine;)hath caused me to come hither: and by vertue of his command, amready (for once onely) to fulfill your pleasure, but far from any willor consent in my selfe. If Signior Ansaldo were abashed at thefirst, hee began now to be more confounded with admiration, when heheard the Lady speake in such strange manner: and being much movedwith the liberall command of her husband, he began to alter hisinflamed heate, into most honourable respect and compassion, returningher this answer.

　　Most noble Lady, the Gods forbid (if it be so as you have sayd) thatI should (Villain-like) soile the honour of him, that takes suchunusuall compassion of my unchaste appetite. And therefore, you mayremaine heere so long as you please, in no other condition, but asmine owne naturall borne Sister; and likewise, you may depart freelywhen you will: conditionally, that (on my behalfe) you render suchthankes to your husband, as you thinke convenient for his great bountytowards me, accounting me for ever heereafter, as his loyall Brotherand faithfull servant. Dianora having well observed his answer, herheart being ready to mount out at her mouth with joy, said. All theworld could never make mee beleeve (considering your honourableminde and honesty) that it would happen otherwise to me, then now ithath done, for which noble courtesie, I will continually remaineobliged to you. So, taking her leave, she returned home honorablyattended to her husband, and relating to him what had happened, itproved the occasion of begetting intire love and friendship,betweene himselfe and the Noble Lord Ansaldo.

　　Now concerning the skilfull Magitian, to whom Ansaldo meant togive the bountifull recompence agreed on betweene them, hee havingseene the strange liberality, which the husband expressed to SigniorAnsaldo, and that of Ansaldo to the Lady, hee presently saide. Greatjupiter strike me dead with thunder, having my selfe seene a husbandso liberall of his honour, and you Sir of true noble kindnesse, if Ishould not be the like of my recompence: for, perceiving it to be soworthily imployed, I am well contented that you shal keepe it. TheNoble Lord was modestly ashamed, and strove (so much as in him lay)that he should take all, or the greater part thereof: but seeing helaboured meerly in vaine, after the third day was past, and theMagitian had destroyed the Garden againe, hee gave him free liberty todepart, quite controlling all fond and unchaste affection in himselfe,either towards Dianora, or any Lady else, and living (ever after) asbest becommeth any Nobleman to do.

　　What say you now Ladies? Shal wee make any account of the womanwel-neere dead, and the kindnesse growne cold in Signiour Gentile,by losse of his former hopes, comparing them with the liberality ofSignior Ansaldo, affecting more fervently, then ever the other did?And being (beyond hope) possessed of the booty, which (above allthings else in the world) he most desired to have, to part with itmeerly in fond compassion? I protest (in my judgement) the one is noway comparable to the other; that of Geitile, with this last ofSignior Ansaldo.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE SIXT NOVELL

　　SUFFICIENTLY DECLARING, THAT HOW MIGHTY SOEVER THE POWER OF

　　LOVE IS: YET A MAGNANIMOUS AND TRULY GENEROUS HEART, IT CAN

　　BY NO MEANES FULLY CONQUER

　　Victioious King Chrles, sirnamed the Aged, and first of that Name,fell in love with a yong Maiden, named Genevera, daughter to anancient Knight, called Signior Neri degli Uberti. And waxing ashamedof his amorous folly, caused both Genevera, and her fayre SisterIsotta, to be joyned in marriage with two Noble Gentlemen; the onenamed Signior Maffeo da Palizzi, and the other, Signior Gulielmo dellaMagna.

　　Who is able to expresse ingeniously, the diversity of opinions,which hapned among the Ladies, in censuring on the act of MadameDianora, and which of them was most liberall, eithet SigniorGilberto the Husband, Lord Ansaldo the importunate suiter, or theMagitian, expecting to bee bountifully rewarded. Surely, it is amatter beyond my capacity: but after the King had permitted theirdisputation a long while, looking on Madam Fiammetta, he commandedthat she should report her Novel to make an end of their controversie;and she (without any further delaying) thus began. I did alwaies(Noble Ladies) hold it fit and decent, that in such an assembly asthis of ours is, every one ought to speake so succinctly andplainly: that the obscure understanding, concerning the matters spokenof, should have no cause of disputation. For disputes do much betterbecome the Colledges of Schollers, then to be among us, who hardly canmanage our Distaves or Samplers. And therefore I, who intend to relatesomething, which (peradventure) might appeare doubtfull: will forbeare(seeing you in such a difference; for that which hath bin spokenalreadie) to use any difficult discourse; but will speake of one, aman of no meane ranke or quality, being both a valiant and vertuousKing, and what he did, without any impeach or blemish to his honor.

　　I make no doubt, but you have often heard report, of king Charls theAged, and first of that name, by reason of his magnificententerprises, as also his most glorious victory, which he obtaindagainst King Manfred, when the Ghibellines were expulsed foorth ofFlorence, and the Guelphes returned thither againe. By which occasion,an ancient knight, named Signior Neri degli Uberti; forsaking then theCity, with all his family and great store of wealth, woulde live underany other obedience, then the awful power or command of KingCharles. And coveting to be in some solitary place, where he mightfinish the remainder of his dayes in peace, he went to Castello daMare; where, about a Bow shoote distance from all other dwellinghouses, hee bought a parcel of ground, plentifully stored with varietyof Trees, bearing Olives, Chesnuts, Orenges, Lemons, Pomcitrons, andother excellent frutages, wherewith the Countrey flourishethabundantly. There he built a very faire and commodious house, andplanted (close by it) a pleasant Garden, in the middst whereof,because he had great plenty of water: according as other men use todo, being in the like case so wel provided; he made a very goodlyPond, which forthwith had all kinde of Fish swimming in it, it beinghis daily care and endevour, to tend his Garden, and encrease hisFish-pond.

　　It fortuned, that King Charles in the Summer time) for hispleasure and recreation, went to repose himselfe (for some certaynedayes) at Castello de Mare, where having heard report of the beautieand singularitie of Signiour Neries Garden; hee grew very desirousto see it. But when he understoode to whome it belonged, then heentred into consideration with himselfe, that hee was an ancientKnight, maintaining a contrarie faction to his: wherefore, hethought it fit to goe in some familiar manner, and with no trayneattending on him. Wherupon he sent him word, that he wold come tovisit him, with foure Gentlemen onely in his companie, meaning tosup with him in his Garden the next night ensuing. The newes wasvery welcome to Signior Neri, who took order in costly maner for allthings to bee done, entertaining the King most joyfully into hisbeautifull Garden.

　　When the King had survayed all, and the house likewise, he commendedit beyond all other comparison, and the Tables being placed by thePonds side, he washed his hands therin, and then sat down at the theCount, Sir Guy de Montforte (who was one of them which came in hiscompany) to sitte downe by him, and Signior Neri on his other side. Asfor the other three of the traine, hee commaunded them to attend onhis service, as Signior Neri had given order. There wanted noexquisite Viandes and excellent Wines, all performed in most decentmanner, and without the least noise or disturbance, wherein the Kingtooke no little delight.

　　Feeding thus in this contented manner, and fancying the solitudeof the place: sodainly entred into the garden, two yong Damosels, eachaged about some fifteene yeares, their haire resembling wyars of Gold,and curiously curled, having Chaplets (made like provinciallCrownes) on their heades, and their delicate faces, expressing them tobe rather Angels, then mortall creatures, such was the appearance oftheir admired beauty. Their under-garments were of costly Silke, yetwhite as the finest snow, framed (from the girdle upward) close totheir bodies, but spreading largely downward, like the extendure ofa Pavillion, and so descending to the feet. She that first came insight, caried on her shoulder a couple of fishing Netts, which sheheld fast with her left hand, and in the right she carryed a longstaffe. The other following her, had on her left shoulder aFrying-pan, and under the same arme a small Faggot of woodde, with aTrevit in her hand; and in the other hand a pot of Oyle, as also abrand of fire flaming.

　　No sooner did the King behold them, but he greatly wondered whatthey should be; and, without uttering one word, attended to listenwhat they wold say. Both the yong damosels, when they were come beforethe King, with modest and bashfull gesture, they performed very humblereverence to him, and going to the place of entrance into the Pond,she who held the Trevit, set it downe on the ground, with the otherthings also; and taking the staffe which the other Damosell carried:they both went into the Pond, the water whereof reached so high asto their bosomes. One of the Servants to Signior Neri, presentlykindled the fire, setting the Trevit over it, and putting Oyle intothe Frying-panne, held it uppon the Trevit, awaiting untill theDamosels should cast him uppe Fish. One of them did beate a place withthe staffe, where she was assured of the Fishes resort, and theother hadde lodged the Nets so conveniently, as they quickly caughtgreat store of Fish, to the Kings high contentment, who observed theirbehaviour very respectively.

　　As the Fishes were throwne up to the servant, alive as they were, hetooke the best and fairest of them, and brought them to the Table,where they skipt and mounted before the King, Count Guy de Montfortand the Father: some leaping from the Table into the Pond againe,and others, the King (in a pleasing humour) voluntarily threw backe tothe Damosels. jesting and sporting in this manner, till the servanthad drest divers of them in exquisite order, and served them to theTable according as Signior Neri had ordained. When the Damosels sawthe Fishes service performed, and perceived that they had fishedsufficiently: they came forth of the water, their garments then (beingwet) hanging close about them, even as if they hid no part of theirbodies. Each having taken those things againe, which at first theybrought with them, and saluting the king in like humility as theydid before, returned home to the mansion house.

　　The King and Count likewise, as also the other attendingGentlemen, having duely considered the behavior of the Damosels:commended extraordinarily their beauty and faire feature, with thoseother perfections of Nature so gloriously shining in them. But (beyondall the rest) the King was boundlesse in his praises given of them,having observed their going into the water, the equall carriagethere of them both, their comming forth, and gracious demeanor attheir departing (yet neither knowing of whence, or what they were)he felt his affection very violently flamed, and grew into such anamourous desire to them both, not knowing which of them pleased himmost, they so choisely resembled one another in all things.

　　But after he had dwelt long enough upon these thoughts, he turnedhim selfe to Signior Neri, and demanded of him, what Damosels theywere. Sir (answered Neri) they are my Daughters, both brought into theworld at one birth, and Twinnes, the one being named Genevera thefaire, and the other Isotta the amiable. The King began againe tocommend them both, and gave him advise to get them both married:wherein he excused himselfe, alleadging, that he wanted power to doeit. At the same time instant, no other service remaining to be broughtto the table, except Fruit and Cheese, the two Damosels returnedagaine, attyred in goodly Roabes of Carnation Sattin, formed after theTurkish fashion, carrying two fayre Silver dishes in their hands,filled with divers delicate Fruites, such as the season then afforded,setting them on the Table before the King. Which being done, theyretyred a little backeward, and with sweet melodious voyces, sung aditty, beginning in this manner.

　　Where Love presumeth into place:

　　Let no one sing in Loves disgrace.

　　So sweet and pleasing seemed the Song to the King (who tooke nosmall delight, both to heare and behold the Damosels) even as if allthe Hirarchies of Angels were descended from the Heavens to singbefore him. No sooner was the Song ended, but (humbly on theirknees) they craved favour of the King for their departing. Now,although their departure was greatly grieving to him, yet (inoutward appearance) he seemed willing to grant it.

　　When Supper was concluded, and the King and his Company remounted onhorsebacke: thankefully departing from Signior Neri, the King returnedto his lodging, concealing there closely his affection to himselfe,and whatsoever important affaires happened: yet he could not forgetthe beauty, and gracious behaviour of Genevera the faire (for whosesake he loved her Sister likewise) but became so linked to her invehement maner, as he had no power to think on any thing else.Pretending other urgent occasions, he fell into great familiarity withSignior Neri, visiting very often his goodly Garden; onely to seehis faire Daughter Genevera, the Adamant which drew him thither.

　　When he felt his amourous assaults, to exceed all power of longersufferance: he resolved determinately with himselfe, (being unprovidedof any better meanes) to take her away from her Father, and notonely she, but her Sister also; discovering both his love and intentto Count Guy de Montforte, who being a very worthy and vertuousLord, and meet to be a Counseller for a King, delivered his mind inthis manner.

　　Gracious Lord, I wonder not a little at your speeches, and so muchthe greater is my admiration, because no man els can be subject to thelike, in regard I have knowne you from the time of your infancy;even to this instant houre, and alwayes your carriage to bee one andthe same. I could never perceive in your youthfull dayes (when loveshould have the greatest meanes to assaile you) any such oppressingpassions: which is now the more novell and strange to me, to heareit but said, that you being old, and called the Aged; should be growneamorous, surely to me it seemeth a miracle. And if it appertained tome to reprehend you in this case, I know well enough what I could say.Considering, you have yet your Armour on your backe, in a Kingdomenewly conquered, among a Nation not knowne to you, full of falsehoods,breaches, and treasons; all which are no meane motives to care andneedfull respect. But having now wone a little leisure, to rest yourselfe a while from such serious affaires; can you give way to the idlesuggestions of Love? Beleeve me Sir, it is no act becomming amagnanimious King; but rather the giddy folly of a young braine.

　　Moreover you say (which most of all I mislike) that you intend totake the two Virgines from the Knight, who hath given youentertainment in his house beyond his ability, and to testifie howmuch he honoured you, he suffered you to have a sight of them, meerely(almost) in a naked manner: witnessing thereby, what constant faith hereposed in you, beleeving verily, that you were a just King, and not aravenous Woolfe. Have you so soone forgot, that the rapes andviolent actions, done by King Manfred to harmelesse Ladies, madeyour onely way of entrance into this Kingdome? What treason was evercommitted, more worthy of eternall punishment, then this will be inyou: to take away from him (who hath so highly honoured you) hischiefest hope and consolation? What will be said by all men, if youdoe it?

　　Peradventure you thinke, it will be a sufficient excuse for you,to say: I did it, in regard hee was a Ghibelline. Can you imagine thisto be justice in a King, that such as get into their possession inthis manner (whatsoever it be) ought to use it in this sort? Let metell you Sir, it was a most worthy victory for you, to conquer KingManfred: but it is farre more famous victory, for a man to conquerhimselfe. You therfore, who are ordained to correct vices in othermen, learne first to subdue them in your selfe, and (by brideling thisinordinate appetite) set not a foule blemish on so faire a fame, aswill be honour to you to preserve spotlesse.

　　These words pierced the heart of the King deepely, and so much themore afflicted him, because he knew them to be most true: wherefore,after he had ventred a very vehement sigh, thus he replyed. Beleeve menoble Count, there is not any enemy, how strong soever he be, but Ihold him weake and easie to be vanquished, by him who is skilfull inthe warre, where a man may learne to conquere his owne appetite. Butbecause he shall find it a laborious taske, requiring inestimablestrength and courage; your words have so toucht me to the quicke, thatit becommeth me to let you effectually perceive (and within thecompasse of few dayes) that as I have learned to conquer others, soI am not ignorant, in expressing the like power upon my selfe.Having thus spoken, within some few dayes after, the King beingreturned to Naples, he determined, as we to free himself from anythe like ensuing follie, as also to recompence Signior Neri, for thegreat kindnesse he had shewne to him (although it was a difficultthing, to let another enjoy, what he rather desired for himselfe) tohave the two Damosels married, not as the Daughters of Signior Neri,but even as if they were his owne. And by consent of the Father, hegave Genevera the faire, to Signior Maffeo da Palizzi, and Isottathe amiable, to Signior Gulielmo della Magna, two Noble Knights andhonourable Barons. After he had thus given them in marriage, in sadmourning he departed thence into Apuglia, where by following worthyand honourable actions, he so well overcame all inordinateappetites: that shaking off the enthraling fetters of love, he livedfree from all passions, the rest of his life time, and dyed as anhonourable King.

　　Some perhaps will say, it was a small matter for a King, to giveaway two Damosels in marriage, and I confesse it: but I maintaine itto be great, and more then great, if we say, that a King, being soearnestly enamoured as this King was; should give her away to another,whom he so dearely affected himselfe, without receiving (in recompenceof his affection) so much as a leaffe, flowre, or the least fruit oflove. Yet such was the vertue of this magnificent King, expressed inso highly recompencing the noble Knights courtesie, honouring thetwo daughters so royally, and conquering his owne affections sovertuously.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE SEVENTH NOVELL

　　WHEREIN IS COVERTLY GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND, THAT HOWSOEVER A PRINCE

　　MAY MAKE USE OF HIS ABSOLUTE POWER AND AUTHORITY, TOWARDS MAIDES

　　OR WIVES THAT ARE HIS SUBJECTS: YET HE OUGHT TO DENY AND REJECT

　　ALL THINGS, AS SHALL MAKE HIM FORGETFULL

　　OF HIMSELFE, AND HIS TRUE HONOUR

　　Lisana, the Daughter of a Florentine Apothecary, named BernardoPuccino, being at Palermo, and seeing Piero, King of Aragon run at theTilt; fell so affectionately enamored of him, that she languished inan extreame and long sickenesse. By her owne devise, and means of aSong, sung in the hearing of the King: he vouchsafed to visite her,and giving her a kisse, terming himselfe also to bee her Knight forever after, hee honourably bestowed her in marriage on a youngGentleman, who was called Perdicano, and gave him liberallendowments with her.

　　Madame Fiametta being come to the end of her Novell, and the greatmagnificence of King Charles much commended (howbeit, some of theCompany, affecting the Ghibelline faction, were otherwise minded)Madame Pampinea, by order given from the King, began in this manner.

　　There is no man of good understanding (honourable Ladies) but willmaintaine what you have said of victorious Charles; except such ascannot wish well to any. But because my memory hath instantly informedme, of an action (perhaps) no lesse commendable then this, done byan enemy of the said King Charles, and to a yong Maiden of our City, Iam the more willing to relate it, upon your gentle attentionvouchsafed, as hitherto it hath been courteously granted.

　　At such time as the French were driven out of Sicilie, there dweltat Palermo a Florentine Apothecary, named Bernardo Puccino, a man ofgood wealth and reputation, who had by his Wife one onely Daughter, ofmarriageable yeares, and very beautifull. Piero, King of Arragon,being then become Lord of that Kingdom, he made an admirable FeastRoyall at Palermo, accompanyed with his Lords and Barons. In honour ofwhich publique Feast, the King kept a triumphall day (of Justs andTurnament) at Catalana, and whereat it chanced, that the Daughter ofBernardo, named Lisana, was present. Being in a window, accompaniedwith other Gentlewomen, she saw the King runne at the Tilt, who seemedso goodly a person in her eye; that being never satisfied withbeholding him, she grew enamoured, and fell into extremity ofaffection towards him.

　　When the Feastivall was ended, she dwelling in the house of herFather, it was impossible for her to thinke on any thing else, butonely the love, which she had fixed on a person of such height. Andthat which most tormented her in this case, was the knowledge of herowne condition, being but meane and humble in degree; whereby sheconfessed, that she could not hope for any successefull issue of herproud love. Neverthelesse, she would not refraine from affecting theKing, who taking no note of this kindnesse in her, by anyperceivable meanes; must needs be the more regardles, which procured(by wary observation) her afflictions to be the greater andintollerable.

　　Whereon it came to passe, that this earnest love encreasing in hermore and more, and one melancholly conceit taking hold on another: thefaire Maide, when she could beare the burden of her griefe nolonger; fell into a languishing sickenesse, consuming away daily (byevident appearance) even as the Snow melteth by the warme beames ofthe Sunne.

　　The Father and Mother, much dismayed and displeased at this haplesseaccident, applying her with continuall comforts, Phisicke, and thebest skill remayning in all the Phisitions, sought all possible meaneswayes to give her succour: but all proved to no effect, because inregard of her choyce (which could sort to none other then adesperate end) she was desirous to live no longer. Now it fortuned,that her parents offering her whatsoever remained in their power toperforme, a sudden apprehension entred her minde, to wit, that (ifit might possible be done) before she dyed, she would first have theKing to know, in what manner she stood affected to him. Wherefore, oneday she entreated her Father that a Gentleman, named Manutio deArezza, might be permitted to come see her. This Manutio was (in thosetimes) held to be a most excellent Musitian, both for his voyce insinging, and exquisite skill in playing on Instruments, for which hewas highly in favour with King Piero, who made (almost) daily use ofhim, to heare him both sing and play.

　　Her tender and loving father conceived immediately, that shee wasdesirous to heare his playing and singing, both being comfortable to abody in a languishing. sickenesse, whereupon, he sent presently forthe Gentleman, who came accordingly, and after he had comforted Lisanawith kind and courteous speeches; he played dexteriously on hisLute, which purposely hee had brought with him, and likewise he sungdivers excellent Ditties, which insted of his intended consolationto the Maid, did nothing else but encrease her fire and flame.

　　Afterward, she requested to have some conference with Manutio alone,and every one being gone forth of the Chamber, she spake unto him inthis manner.

　　Manutio, I have made choyce of thee, to be the faithfull Guardian ofan especial secret, hoping first of al, that thou wilt never revealeit to any living body, but onely to him whom I shall bid thee: Andnext, to helpe me so much as possibly thou canst, because my onelyhope relyeth in thee. Know then my dearest friend Manutio, that on thesolemne festivall day, when our Soveraigne Lord the King honouredhis exaltation, with the noble exercises of Tilt and Turney; his bravebehaviour kindled such a sparke in my soule, as since brake forth intoa violent flame, and brought me to this weake condition as now thouseest. But knowing and confessing, how farre unbeseeming my love is,to aime so ambitiously at a King, and being unable to controule it, orin the least manner to diminish it: I have made choyce of the onelyand best remedy of all, namely, to dye, and so I am most willing todoe.

　　True it is, that I shall travaile in this my latest journey, withendlesse torment and affliction of soule, except he have someunderstanding thereof before, and not knowing by whom to give himintelligence, in so oft and convenient order, as by thee: I doetherefore commit this last office of a friend to thy trust, desiringthee, not to refuse me in the performance thereof. And when thouhast done it, to let me understand what he saith, that I may dye themore contentedly, and disburdened of so heavy an oppression, the onelycomfort to a parting spirit: and so she ceased, her teares flowingforth abundantly.

　　Manutio did not a little wonder at the Maides great spirit, andher desperate resolution, which moved him to exceedingcommiseration, and suddenly he conceived, that honestly he mightdischarge this duty for her, whereupon, he returned her this answer.Lisana, here I engage my faith to thee, that thou shalt find mefirme and constant, and die I will, rather then deceive thee.Greatly I doe commend thy high attempt, in fixing thy affection onso Potent a King, wherein I offer thee my utmost assistance: and Imake no doubt (if thou wouldest be of good comfort) to deale in suchsort, as, before three dayes are fully past, to bring such newes aswill content thee, and because I am loath to loose the least time, Iwill goe about it presently. Lisana the yong Maiden, once againeentreated his care and diligence, promising to comfort her selfe sowell as she could, commending him to his good fortune. When Manutiowas gone from her, hee went to a Gentleman, named Mico de Sienna,one of the best Poets in the composing of verses, as all those partsyeelded not the like. At his request, Mico made for him this ensuingDittie.

　　THE SONG

　　SUNG IN THE HEARING OF KING PIERO, ON THE

　　BEHALFE OF LOVE-SICKE LISANA

　　Goe Love, and tell the torments I endure,

　　Say to my Soveraigne Lord, that I must die

　　Except he come, some comfort to procure,

　　For tell I may not, what I feele, and why.

　　With heaved hands Great Love, I call to thee,

　　Goe see my Soveraigne, where he doth abide,

　　And say to him, in what extremity,

　　Thou hast (for him) my firm affection tryed.

　　To die for him, it is my sole desire,

　　For live with him I may not, nor aspire,

　　To have my fortunes thereby dignified,

　　Onely his sight would lend me life a while:

　　Grant it (great love) mine anguish to beguile.

　　Goe love, and tell the torments, etc.

　　Since the first houre that love enthralled me,

　　I never had the heart, to tell my griefe,

　　My thoughts did speake, for thoughts be alwayes free,

　　Yet hopefull thoughts doe find but poore reliefe.

　　When Gnats will mount to Eagles in the ayre,

　　Alas! they scorne them, for full well they know,

　　They were not bred to prey so base and low,

　　Aloft they look, to make their flight more faire.

　　And yet his sight would lend me life a while:

　　Grant it (great love) mine anguish to beguile.

　　Goe love, and tell the torments, etc.

　　If sight shall be denyed, then tell them plaine,

　　His high triumphall day procurd my death,

　　The Launce that won him Honour, hath me slaine,

　　For instantly it did bereave my breath.

　　That speake I could not, nor durst be so bold,

　　To make the Ayre acquainted with my woe:

　　Alas! I lookt so high, and doing so,

　　Justly deserve by death to be controld.

　　Yet mercies sight would lend me life a while,

　　Grant it (great love) mine anguish to beguffe.

　　Goe love, and tell the torments I endure,

　　Say to my Soveraigne Lord, that I must die:

　　Except he come, some comfort to procure,

　　For tell I may not, what I feele, and why.

　　The lines contained in this Ditty, Manutio fitted with noates somooving and singularly musicall, that every word had the seisiblemotion of life in it, where the King being (as yet) not risen from theTable, he commanded him to use both his Lute and voyce.

　　This seemed a happy opportunity to Manutio, to sing the dittie sopurposely done and devised: which hee delivered in such excellentmanner, the voice and Instrument concording so extraordinary pleasing;that all the persons then in the Presence, seemed rather Statues, thenliving men, so strangely they were wrapt with admiration, and the Kinghimselfe farre beyond all the rest, transported with a rare kinde ofalteration.

　　When Manutio had ended the Song, the King demanded of him, whencethis Song came, because he had never heard it before? My graciousLord, answered Manutio, it must needes seeme straunge to your Majesty,because it is not fully three dayes, since it was invented, made,and set to the note. Then the King asked, whom it concerned? Sir(quoth Manutio) I dare not disclose that to any but onely yourselfe. Which answer made the King much more desirous, and beingrisen from the Table, he tooke him into his Bedchamber, whereManutio related all at large to him, according to the trust reposed inhim. Wherwith the King was wonderfully well pleased, greatlycommending the courage of the Maide, and said, that a Virgin of such avaliant spirit, did well deserve to have her case commiserated: andcommanded him also, to goe (as sent from him) and comfort her, withpromise, that the very same day, in the evening, he would not faile tocome and see her.

　　Manutio, more then contented, to carry such glad tydings toLisana; without staying in any place, and taking his Lute also withhim, went to the Apothecaries house, where speaking alone with theMaide: he told her what he had done, and afterward sung the song toher, in as excellent manner as he had done before, wherein Lisanaconceived such joy and contentment, as even in the very same moment,it was observed by apparant signes, that the violence of her fitsforsooke her, and health began to get the upper hand of them. SO,without suffering any one in the house to know it, or by the leastmeanes to suspect it; she comforted her selfe till the evening, inexpectation of her Soveraignes arrivall.

　　Piero being a Prince, of most liberall and benigne nature, havingafterward divers times considered on the matters which Manutio hadrevealed to him, knowing also the yong Maiden, to bee bothbeautifull and vertuous: was so much moved with pitty of herextremitie, as mounting on horsebacke in the evening, and seeming asif he rode abroad for his private recreation; he went directly tothe Apothecaries house, where desiring to see a goodly garden,appertaining then to the Apothecarie, he dismounted from his horse.Walking into the garden, he began to question with Bernardo,demaunding him for his Daughter, and whether he had (as yet) marryedher, or no? My Gracious Lord, answered Bernardo, as yet shee is notmarryed, neither likely to bee, in regard shee hath had a long andtedious sickenesse: but since Dinner time, she is indifferentlyeased of her former violent paine, which we could not discerne thelike alteration in her, a long while before.

　　The King understood immediately, the reason of this so suddenalteration, and said. In good faith Bernardo, the world would sustainea great maine and imperfection, by the losse of thy faire daughter;wherefore, we will goe our selfe in person to visite her. So, with twoof his Lords onely, and the Father, he ascended to the MaidesChamber and being entred, he went to the Beds side, where she sate,somewhat raised, in expectation of his comming, and taking her bythe hand, he said. Faire Lisana, how commeth this to passe? Youbeing so faire a Virgin, yong, and in the delicacy of your daies,which should be the chiefest comfort to you, will you suffer yourselfe to be over-awed with sickenesse? Let us intreat you, that (forour sake) you will be of good comfort, and thereby recover your healththe sooner, especially, when it is requested by a King, who is sorryto see so bright a beauty sicke, and would helpe it, it consisted inhis power.

　　Lisana, feeling the touch of his hand, whom she loved above allthings else in the world, although a bashfull blush mounted up intoher cheekes: yet her heart was seazed with such a rapture of pleasure,that she thought her selfe translated into Paradise, and, so well asshe could, thus she replyed. Great King, by opposing my feeblestrength, against a burden of over-ponderous weight, it became theoccasion of this grievous sickenesse: but I hope that the violencethereof is (almost) already kild, onely by this soveraigne mercy inyou, and doubtlesse it will cause my speedy deliverance. The Kingdid best understand this so well palliated answere of Lisana, which ashe did much commend, in regard of her high adventuring; so he didagaine as greatly condemne Fortune, for not making her more happy inher birth.

　　So, after he had stayed there a good while, and given her manycomfortable speeches, he returned backe to the Court. This humanity inthe King, was reputed a great honour to the Apothecary and hisdaughter, who (in her owne mind) received as much joy andcontentment thereby, as ever any wife could have of her owne Husband.

　　And being assisted by better hopes, within a short while after,she became recovered, and farre more beautifull (in common judgment)then ever she was before.

　　Lisana being now in perfect health, the King consulted with hisQueene, what meete recompence he should gratifie her withall, forloving and affecting him in such fervent manner. Upon a daydetermined, the King mounting on horsebacke, accompanied with manyof his cheefest Lords and Barons, he rode to the Apothecaries house,where walking in his beautifull Garden, hee called for Bernardo andhis daughter Lisana. In the meane space, the Queene also came thither,Royally attended on by her Ladies, and Lisana being admitted intotheir company, they expressed themselves very gracious to her. Sooneafter, the King and the Queene cald Lisana, and the King spake in thismanner to her.

　　Faire Virgin, the extraordinary love which you bare to us, callethfor as great honour from us to you; in which respect, it is our Royalldesire, by one meanes or other to requite your kinde Love. In ouropinion, the chief honour we can extend to you. is, that being ofsufficient yeares for marriage, you would grace us so much, as toaccept him for your Husband, whom we intend to bestow on you. Besidethis further grant from us, that (notwithstanding whatsoever else) youshall call us your Knight; without coveting any thing else from you,for so great favour, but only one kisse, and thinke not to bestow itnicely on a King, but grant it the rather, because he begges it.

　　Lisana, whose lookes were dyed with a vermillian tincture, or ratherconverted into a pure maiden blush, reputing the Kings desire to beher owne; in a low and humbled voyce, thus answered. My Lord, mostcertaine am I, that if it had beene publikely knowne, how none butyour highnes, might serve for me to fixe my love on, I should havebeen termed the foole of all fooles: they perhaps beleeving, that Iwas forgetfull of my selfe, in being ignorant of mine ownecondition, and much lesse of yours. But the Gods are my witnesses(because they know the secrets of all hearts) that even in the veryinstant, when Loves fire tooke hold on my yeelding affection: I knewyou to be a King, and my selfe the daughter of poore Bernardo theApothecary: likewise, how farre unfitting it was for me, to be soambitious in my loves presuming. But I am sure your Majestie doth know(much better then I am able to expresse) that no one becommethamourous, according to the duty of election, but as the appetiteshapeth his course, against whose lawes my strength made manyresistances, which not prevailing, I presumed to love, did, and so forever shall doe, your Majestie.

　　Now Royall Soveraigne, I must needes confesse, that so soone as Ifelt my selfe thus wholly conquered by loving you, I resolved for everafter, to make your will mine owne, and therefore, am not onelywilling to accept him for my Husband, whom you shall please toappoint, befitting my honor and degree: but if you will have me tolive in a flaming fire, my obedience shall sacrifice it selfe toyour will, with the absolute conformity of mine owne. To stile youby the name of my Knight, whom I know to be my lawfull King andSoveraigne; you are not ignorant, how farre unfitting a word that werefor me to use: As also the kisse which you request, in requitall of mylove to you; to these two I will never give consent, without theQueenes most gracious favour and license first granted. Neverthelesse,for such admirable benignity used to me, both by your Royall selfe,and your vertuous Queene: heaven shower downe all boundlesse graces onyou both, for it exceedeth all merit in me, and so she ceasedspeaking, in most dutifull manner.

　　The answer of Lisana pleased the Queene exceedingly, in findingher to be so wise and faire, as the King himself had before informedher: who instantly called for her Father and Mother, and knowingthey would be well pleased with whatsoever he did; he called for aproper yong Gentleman, but somewhat poore, being named Perdicano,and putting certaine Rings into his hand, which he refused not toreceive, caused him there to espouse Lisana. To whome the King gaveimmediately (besides Chaines and jewels of inestimable valew,delivered by the Queene to the Bride) Ceffala and Calatabelotta, twogreat territories abounding in divers wealthy possessions, saying toPerdicano. These wee give thee, as a dowry in marriage with thisbeautifull Maid, and greater gifts we will bestow on thee hereafter,as we shal perceive thy love and kindnesse to her.

　　When he had ended these words, hee turned to Lisana, saying: Heeredoe I freely give over all further fruits of your affection towardsme, thanking you for your former love: so taking her head betweene hishands he kissed her faire forhead, which was the usuall custome inthose times. Perdicano, the Father and Mother of Lisana, and she herselfe likewise, extraordinarily joyfull for this so fortunate amarriage, returned humble and hearty thankes both to the King andQueene, and (as many credible Authors doe affirme) the King kept hispromise made to Lisana, because (so long as he lived) he alwalestermed himselfe by the name of her Knight, and in al actions ofChivalry by him undertaken, he never carried any other devise, butsuch as he received still from her.

　　By this, and divers other like worthy deeds, not onely did he winthe hearts of his subjects; but gave occasion to the who world beside,to renowne his fame to all succeeding posterity. Whereto (in thesemore wretched times of ours) few or none bend the sway of theirunderstanding: but rather how to bee cruell and tyrranous Lords, andthereby win the hatred of their people.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE EIGHT NOVELL

　　DECLARING, THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FROWNES OF FORTUNE,

　　DIVERSITY OF OCCURRENCES, AND CONTRARY ACCIDENTS HAPPENING:

　　YET LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP OUGHT TO BE PRECIOUSLY PRESERVED

　　AMONG MEN

　　Sophronia, thinking her selfe to be the maried wife of Gisippus, was(indeed) the wife of Titus Quintus Fulvius, and departed thence withhim to Rome. Within a while after, Gisippus also came thither invery poore condition, and thinking that he was despised by Titus, grewweary of his life, and confessed that he had murdred a man, with fulintent to die for the fact. But Titus taking knowledge of him, anddesiring to save the life of Gisippus, charged himself to have donethe bloody deed. Which the murderer himself (standing then among themultitude) seeing, truly confessed the deed. By meanes whereof, allthree were delivered by the Emperor Octavius; and Titus gave hisSister in mariage to Gisippus, giving them also the most part of hisgoods and inheritances.

　　By this time Madam Philomena, at command of the King, (MadamPampinea ceasing) prepared to follow next in order, whereupon thus shebegan. What is it (Gracious Ladies) that Kings cannot do (if theylist) in matters of greatest importance, and especially unto such asmost they should declare their magnificence? He then that performethwhat he ought to do, when it is within his owne power, doth well.But it is not so much to bee admired, neither deserveth halfe thecommendations, as when one man doth good to another, when least itis expected, as being out of his power, and yet performed. In whichrespect, because you have so extolled king Piero, as appearing notmeanly meritorious in your judgements; I make no doubt but you will bemuch more pleased, when the actions of our equals are duly considered,and shal paralell any of the greatest Kings. Wherefore I purpose totell you a Novel, concerning an honorable curtesie of two worthyfriends.

　　At such time as Octavius Caesar (not as yet named Augustus, but onlyin the office called Triumveri) governed the Romane Empire, theredwelt in Rome a Gentleman, named Publius Quintus Fulvius, a man ofsingular understanding, who having one son, called Titus QuintusFulvius, of towardly yeares and apprehension, sent him to Athens tolearne Philosophy, but with letters of familiar commendations, to aNoble Athenian Gentleman, named Chremes, being his ancient friend, oflong acquaintance. This Gentleman lodged Titus in his owne house, ascompanion to his son, named Gisippus, both of them studyingtogether, under the tutoring of a Philosopher, called Aristippus.These two yong Gentlemen living thus in one Citty, House, and Schoole,it bred betweene them such a brother-hoode and amity, as they couldnot be severed from one another, but only by the accident of death;nor could either of them enjoy any content, but when they were bothtogether in company.

　　Being each of them endued with gentle spirits, and having beguntheir studies together: they arose (by degrees) to the glorious heightof Philosophy, to their much admired fame and commendation. In thismanner they lived, to the no meane comfort of Chremes, hardlydistinguishing the one from the other for his Son, and thus theSchollers continued the space of three yeares. At the ending wherof(as it hapneth in al things else) Chremes died, whereat both the youngGentlemen conceived such hearty griefe, as if he had bin theircommon father; nor could the kinred of Chremes discerne, which ofthe two had most need of comfort, the losse touched them so equally.

　　It chanced within some few months after, that the kinred of Gisippuscame to see him, and (before Titus) avised him to marriage, and with ayong Gentlewoman of singular beauty, derived from a most noble housein Athens, and she named Sophronia, aged about fifteen years. Thismariage drawing neere, Gisippus on a day, intreated Titus to walkalong with him thither, because (as yet) he had not seene her.Commingto the house, and she sitting in the midst betweene them, Titusmaking himselfe a considerator of beauty, and especially on hisfriends behalfe; began to observe her very judicially, and everypart of her seemed so pleasing in his eie, that giving them al aprivat praise, yet answerable to their due deserving; he becam soenflamed with affection to her, as never any lover could bee moreviolentlie surprized, so sodainly doth beauty beguile our best senses.

　　After they had sate an indifferent while with her, they returnedhome to their lodging, where Titus being alone in his chamber, beganto bethink himselfe on her, whose perfections had so powerfullypleased him: and the more he entred into this consideration, thefiercer he felt his desires enflamed, which being unable to quench, byany reasonable perswasions, after hee had vented foorth infinitesighes, thus he questioned with himselfe.Most unhappie Titus as thou art, whether doost thou transport thineunderstanding, love, and hope? Dooest thou not know as well by thehonourable favours, which thou hast received of Chremes and his house,as also the intire amity betweene thee and Gisippus (unto whom faireSophronia is the afflanced friend) that thou shouldst holde her in thelike reverent respect, as if shee were thy true borne Sister? Darestthou presume to fancie her? Whether shall beguiling Love allurethee, and vaine immaging hopes carrie thee? Open the eyes of thybetter understanding, and acknowledge thy selfe to bee a mostmiserable man. Give way to reason, bridle thine intemperate appetites,reforme all irregulare desires, and guide thy fancy to a place ofbetter direction. Resist thy wanton and lascivious will in thebeginning, and be master of thy selfe, while thou hast opportunity,for that which thou aimest at, is neyther reasonable nor honest. Andif thou wert assured to prevaile upon this pursuite, yet thououghtst to avoide it, if thou hast any regard of true friendship,and the duty therein justly required. What wilt thou do then Titus?Fly from this inordinate affection, if thou wilt be reputed to be aman of sensible judgement.

　　After he had thus discoursed with himselfe, remembring Sophronia,and converting his former allegations, into a quite contrarie sense,in utter detestation of them, and guided by his idle appetite, thus hebegan againe. The lawes of love are of greater force, then any otherwhatsoever, they not only breake the bands of friendship, but eventhose also of more divine consequence. How many times hath it binnoted, the father to affect his own daughter, the brother hissister, and the stepmother her son in law, matters far more monstrous,then to see one friend love the wife of another, a case happeningcontinually? Moreover, I am yong, and youth is wholly subjected to thepassions of Love: is it reasonable then, that those should be bardfrom me, which are fitting and pleasing to Love? Honest things, belongto men of more years and maturity, then I am troubled withall, and Ican covet none, but onely those wherein Love is directer. The beautyof Sophronia is worthy of generall love, and if I that am a yongman dolove her, what man living can justly reprove me for it? Shold not Ilove her, because she is affianced to Gisippus? That is no matter tome, I ought to love her, because she is a woman, and women werecreated for no other occasion, but to bee Loved. Fortune had sinned inthis case, and not I, in directing my frends affection to her,rather then any other; and if she ought to be loved, as herperfections do challenge, Gisippus understanding that I affect her,may be the better contented that it is I, rather then any other.

　　With these, and the like crosse entercourses, he often mockthimselfe, falling into the contrary, and then to this againe, and fromthe contrary, into another kind of alteration, wasting and consuminghimselfe, not only this day and the night following, but many moreafterward, til he lost both his feeding and sleepe, so that throughdebility of body, he was constrained to keepe his bed. Gisippus, whohad divers dayes noted his melancholly disposition, and now hisfalling into extreamitie of sicknesse, was very sorry to behold it:and with all meanes and inventions he could devise to use, hee bothquestioned the cause of this straunge alteration, and essayed everieway, how hee might best comfort him, never ceassing to demaunde areason, why he should become thus sad and sickely. But Titus afterinfinite importuning (which still he answered) with idle and frivolousexcuses, farre from the truth indeede, and (to the no meane afflictionof his friend) when he was able to use no more contradictions; atlength, in sighes and teares, thus he replyed.

　　Gisippus, were the Gods so wel pleased, I could more gladly yeild todye, then continue any longer in this wretched life, considering, thatFortune hath brought mee to such an extremity, as proofe is now tobe made of my constancie and vertue; both which I finde conquered inme, to my eternall confusion and shame. But my best hope is, that Ishal shortly be requited, as I have in justice deserved, namely withdeath, which will be a thousand times more welcome to me, then aloathed life, with remembrance of my base dejection in courage,which because I can no longer conceale from thee; not without blushingshame, I am well contented for to let thee know it.

　　Then began hee to recount, the whole occasion of this straungeconflict in him, what a maine battaile hee had with his privatethoughts, confessing that they got the victory, causing him to diehourely for the love of Sophronia, and affirming withall, that indue acknowledgement, how greatly hee had transgressed against thelawes of friendship, he thought no other penance sufficient for him,but onely death, which he willingly expected every houre, and with allhis heart would gladly bid welcome.

　　Gisippus hearing this discourse, and seeing how Titus bitterly wept,in agonies of most moving afflictions: sat an indifferent while sadand pensive, as being wounded with affection to Sophronia, but yetin a well-governed and temperate manner without any long delaying, heeconcluded with himselfe; that the life of his friend ought to beaccounted much more deare, then any love hee could beare untoSophronia: And in this resolution, the teares of Titus forcing hiseyes to flow forth like two Fountaines, thus he replyed.

　　Titus, if thou hadst not neede of comfort, as plainly I see thouhast, I would justly complaine of thee to my selfe, as of the manwho hath violated our friendship, in keeping thine extreamitie so longtime concealed from mee, which hath beene overtedious for thee toendure. And although it might seeme to thee a dishonest case, andtherefore kept from the knowledge of thy friend, yet I plainly tellthee, that dishonest courses (in the league of amitie) deserve no moreconcealment, then those of the honestest nature. But leaving theseimpertinent wandrings, let us come to them of much greater necessitie.

　　If thou doest earnestly love faire Sophronia, who is betroathedand afflanced to me, it is no matter for me to marvaile at: but Ishould rather be much abashed, if thou couldst not intyrely affecther, knowing how beautifull she is, and the nobility of her minde,being as able to sustaine passion, as the thing pleasing is fullest ofexcellence. And looke how reasonable thou fanciest Sophronia, asunjustly thou complainest of thy fortune, in ordaining her to be mywife, although thou doest not speake it expresly: as being of opinion,that thou mightst with more honesty love her, if she were anyothers, then mine. But if thou art so wise, as I have alwayes heldthee to be, tell me truely upon thy faith, to whom could Fortunebetter guide her, and for which thou oughtest to be more thankfull,then in bestowing her on me? Any other that had enjoyed her,although thy love were never so honest, yet he would better affect herhimselfe, then for thee, which thou canst not (in like manner) lookefor from me, if thou doest account me for thy friend, and asconstant now as ever.

　　Reason is my warrant in this case, because I cannot remember,since first our entrance into friendship, that ever I enjoyed anything, but it was as much thine, as mine. And if our affaires had suchan equall course before, as otherwise they could not subsist; mustthey not now be kept in the same manner? Can any thing moreperticularly appertaine to me, but thy right therein is as absolute asmine? I know not how thou maist esteeme of my friendship, if in anything concerning my selfe, I can plead my priviledge to be abovethine. True it is, that Sophronia is affianced to me, and I love herdearely, daily expecting when our nuptials shall be celebrated. Butseeing thou doest more fervently affect her, as being better able toJudge of the perfections, remaining in so excellent a creature asshe is, then I doe: assure thy selfe, and beleeve it constantly,that she shall come to my bed, not as my wife but onely thine. Andtherefore leave these despairing thoughts, shake off this cloudydisposition, reassume thy former joviall spirit, with comfort and whatelse can content thee: in expectation of the happy houre, and the justrequitall of thy long, loving, and worthy friendship, which I havealwayes valued equall with mine owne life.

　　Titus hearing this answer of Gisippus, looke how much the sweet hopeof that which he desired gave him pleasure, as much both duty andreason affronted him with shame; setting before his eyes this duconsideration, that the greater the liberality of Gisippus was,farre greater and unreasonable it appeared to him in disgrace, ifhee should unmannerly accept it. Wherefore, being unable to refrainfrom teares, and with such strength as his weaknesse would give leave,thus he replyed.

　　Gisippus, thy bounty and firme friendship suffereth me to seeapparantly, what (on my part) is no more then ought to be done. Allthe Gods forbid, that I should receive as mine, her whom they haveadjudged to be thine, by true respect of birth and desert. For if theyhad thought her a wife fit for me, doe not thou or any else imagine,that ever she should have beene granted to thee. Use freelytherefore thine owne election, and the gracious favour wherewiththey have blessed thee: leave me to consume away in teares, a mourninggarment by them appointed for me, as being a man unworthy of suchhappinesse; for either I shall conquer this disaster, and that wilbe my crowne, or else will vanquish me, and free me from all paine:whereto Gisippus presently thus answered.

　　Worthy Titus, if our amity would give me so much licence, as butto contend with my selfe, in pleasing thee with such a thing as Idesire, and could also induce thee therein to be directed: it is theonely end whereat I aime, and am resolved to pursue it. In whichregard, let my perswasions prevaile with thee, and thereto I conjurethee, by the faith of a friend, suffer me to use mine authority,when it extendeth both to mine owne honour, and thy good, for I willhave Sophronia to bee onely thine. I know sufficiently, how farrethe forces of love doe extend in power, and am not ignorant also,how not once or twice, but very many times, they have brought loversto unfortunate ends, as now I see thee very neere it, and so farregone, as thou art not able to turne backe againe, nor yet to conquerthine owne teares, but proceeding on further in this extremity, thouwilt be left vanquished, sinking under the burthen of lovestyrannicall oppression, and then my turne is next to follow thee.And therefore, had I no other reason to love thee, yet because thylife is deare to me, in regard of mine owne depending thereon; I standthe neerer thereto obliged. For this cause, Sophronia must and shal bethine, for thou canst not find any other so conforme to thy fancy:albeit I who can easily convert my liking to another wife, but neverto have the like friend againe, shall hereby content both thee, and myselfe.

　　Yet perhaps this is not a matter so easily done, or I to expressesuch liberality therein, if wives were to be found with the likedifficultie, as true and faithfull friends are: but, (being able torecover another wife) though never such a worthy friend; I ratherchuse to change, I doe not say loose her (for in giving her to thee, Iloose her not my selfe) and by this change, make that which was goodbefore, tenne times better, and so preserve both thee and my selfe. Tothis end therefore, if my prayers and perswasions have any powerwith thee, I earnestly entreat thee, that, by freeing thy selfe out ofthis affliction, thou wilt (in one instant) make us both truelycomforted, and dispose thy selfe (living in hope) to embrace thathappinesse, which the fervent love thou bearest to Sophronia, hathjustly deserved.

　　Now although Titus was confounded with shame, to yeeld consent, thatSophronia should be accepted as his wife, and used many obstinateresistances: yet notwithstanding, Love pleading on the one sidepowerfully, and Gisippus as earnestly perswading on the other, thus heanswered. Gisippus, I know not what to say, neither how to behave myselfe in this election, concerning the fitting of mine contentment, orpleasing thee in thy importunate perswasion. But seeing thy liberalityis so great, as it surmounteth all reason or shame in me, I will yeeldobedience to thy more then noble nature. Yet let this remaine forthine assurance, that I doe not receive this grace of thine, as aman not sufficiently understanding, how I enjoy from thee, not onelyher whom most of all I doe affect, but also doe hold my very life ofthee. Grant then you greatest Gods (if you be the Patrones of thismine unexpected felicitie) that with honor and due respect, I mayhereafter make apparantly knowne: how highly I acknowledge this thywonderfull favour, in being more mercifull to me, then I could be tomy selfe.

　　For abridging of all further circumstances, answered Gisippus, andfor easier bringing this matter to full effect, I hold this to beour onely way. It is not unknowne to thee, how after much discoursehad between my kindred, and those belonging to Sophronia, thematrimoniall conjunction was fully agreed on, and therefore, if nowI shall flye off, and say, I will not accept thee as my wife: greatscandall would arise thereby, and make much trouble among our friends,which could not be greatly displeasing to me, if that were the wayto make her thine. But I rather stand in feare, that if I forsakeher in such peremptory sort, her kinred and friends will bestow her onsome other, and so she is utterly lost, without all possible meanes ofrecovery. For prevention therefore of all sinister accidents, I thinkeit best, (if thy opinion jumpe with mine) that I still pursue thebusines, as already I have begun, having thee alwaies in my company,as my dearest friend and onely associate. The nuptials being performedwith our friends, in secret manner at night (as we can cunninglyenough contrive it) thou shalt have her maiden honour in bed, evenas if she were thine owne wife. Afterward, in apt time and place, wewill publiquely make knowne what is done; if they take it well, wewill be as jocond as they: if they frowne and waxe offended, thedeed is done, over-late to be recalled, and so perforce they must restcontented.

　　You may well imagine, this advise was not a little pleasing toTitus, wherupon Gisippus received home Sophronia into his house,with publike intention to make her his wife, according as was thecustome then observed, and Titus being perfectly recovered, waspresent at the Feast very ceremonially observed. When night wascome, the Ladies and Gentlewomen conducted Sophronia to theBride-Chamber, where they left her in her Husbands bed, and thendeparted all away. The Chamber wherein Titus used to lodge, joynedclose to that of Gisippus, for their easier accesse each to the other,at all times whensoever they pleased, and Gisippus being alone inthe Bride-Chamber, preparing as if he were comming to bed:extinguishing the light, he went softly to Titus, willing him to goeto bed to his wife. Which Titus hearing, overcome with shame andfeare, became repentant, and denyed to goe. But Gisippus, being a trueintyre friend indeed, and confirming his words with actions: after alittle lingring dispute, sent him to the Bride, and so soone as he wasin the bed with her, taking Sophronia gently by the hand, softly hemoved the usuall question to her, namely, if she were willing to behis wife.

　　She beleeving verily that he was Gisippus, modestly answered. Sir, Ihave chosen you to be my Husband, reason requires then, that Ishould be willing to be your wife. At which words, a costly Ring,which Gisippus used daily to weare, he put upon her finger, saying.With this Ring, I confesse my selfe to be your Husband, and bind you(for ever) my Spouse and Wife; no other kind of marriage wasobserved in those dayes, and so he continued all the night with her,she never suspecting him to be any other then Gisippus, and thus wasthe marriage consumated, betweene Titus and Sophronia, albeit thefriends (on either side) thought otherwise.

　　By this time, Publius, the father of Titus, was departed out of thismortall life, and letters came to Athens, that with all speed heshould returne to Rome, to take order for occasions there concerninghim; wherefore he concluded with Gisippus about his departure, andtaking Sophronia thither with him, which was no easie matter to bedone, until it were first known, how occasions had bin caried amongthem. Wherupon, calling her one day into her Chamber, they told herentirely, how all had past, which Titus confirmed substantially, bysuch direct passages betweene themselves, as exceeded allpossibility of denyall, and moved in her much admiration; looking eachon other very discontentedly, she heavily weeping and lamenting, andgreatly complaining of Gisippus, for wronging her so unkindly.

　　But before any further noyse was made in the house, shee went to herFather, to whom, as also to her Mother, shee declared the wholetrecherie, how much both they and their other friends were wrongedby Gisippus, avouching her selfe to be the wife of Titus, and not ofGisippus, as they supposed. These newes were highly displeasing to theFather of Sophronia, who with hir kinred, as also those of Gisippus,made great complaints to the Senate, very dangerous troubles andcommotions arising daily betweene them, drawing both Gisippus andSophronia into harsh reports; he being generally reputed, not onelyworthy of all bitter reproofe, but also the severest punishment.Neverthelesse, hee maintained publikely what he had done, avouching itfor an act both of honour and honestie, wherewith Sophronia'sfriends had no reason to bee offended, but rather to take it in verythankfull part, having married a man of farre greater worth andrespect, than himselfe was, or could be.

　　On the other side, Titus hearing these uncivill acclamations, becamemuch moved and provoked at them, but knowing it was a custome observedamong the Greeks, to be so much the more hurried away with rumours andthreatnings, as lesse they finde them to be answered, and when theyfinde them, shew themselves not onely humble enough, but rather asbase men, and of no courage; he resolved with himselfe, that theirbraveries were no longer to be enclured, without some bold and manlyanswere. And having a Romane heart, as also an Athenian understanding,by politique perswasions, he caused the kinred of Gisippus andSophronia, to be assembled in a Temple, and himselfe commingthither, accompanied with none but Gisippus onely, he began to deliverhis minde before them all, in this manner following.

　　"Many Philosophers doe hold opinion, that the actions performed bymortall men, doe proceed from the disposing and ordination of theimmortall gods. Whereupon some doe maintaine, that things which bedone, or never are to be done, proceed of necessity: howbeit someother doe hold, that this necessity is onely referred to thingsdone. Both which opinions (if they be considered with mature judgment)doe most manifestly approve, that they who reprehend any thing whichis irrevocable, doe nothing else but shew themselves, as if theywere wiser then the Gods, who we are to beleeve, that withperpetuall reason, and void of any error, doe dispose and governe bothus, and all our actions; In which respect, how foolish andbeast-like a thing it is, presumptuously to checke or controuletheir operations, you may very easily consider; and likewise, howjustly they deserve condigne punishment, who suffer themselves to betransported in so temerarious a manner.

　　"In which notorious transgression, I understand you all to beguiltie, if common fame speake truely, concerning the marriage of myselfe and Sophronia, whom you imagined as given to Gisippus; for younever remember that it was so ordained from eternitie, shee to bemine, and no Wife for Gisippus, as at this instant is made manifest byfull effect. But because the kinde of speaking, concerning divineprovidence, and intention of the Gods, may seeme a difficult matter tomany, and somewhat hard to bee understood: I am content to presuppose,that they meddle not with any thing of ours, and will onely stay myselfe on humane reasons, and in this nature of speech, I shall beenforced to doe two things, quite contrary to my naturall disposition.The one is, to speake somewhat in praise and commendation of my selfe:And the other, justly to blame and condemne other mens seemingestimation. But because both in the one and the other, I doe notintend to swerve a jot from the Truth, and the necessitie of thepresent case in question, doth not onely require, but also command it,you must pardon what I am to say.

　　"Your complaints doe proceed, rather from furie then reason, and(with continuall murmurings, or rather seditions) slander,backe-bite and condemne Gisippus, because (of his owne free will andnoble disposition) hee gave her to be my Wife, whom (by your election)was made his; wherein I account him most highly praiseworthy: andthe reasons inducing mee thereunto, are these. The first, because hehath performed no more then what a friend ought to doe: And thesecond, in regard he hath dealt more wisely, then you did. I have nointention, to display (at this present) what the sacred law ofamitie requireth, to be acted by one friend towards another, itshall suffice mee onely to informe you, that the league offriendship (farre stronger then the bond of bloud and kinred)confirmed us in our election of either at the first, to be true,loyall and perpetuall friends; whereas that of kinred, commeth onelyby fortune or chance. And therefore if Gisippus affected more my life,then your benevolence, I being ordained for his friend, as Iconfesse my selfe to be; none of you ought to wonder thereat, inregard it is no matter of mervaile.

　　"But let us come now to our second reason, wherein, with farregreater instance I will shew you, that he hath (in this occasion)shewen himselfe to be much more wise, then you did, or have done:because it plainely appeareth, that you have no feeling of thedivine providence, and much lesse knowledge in the effects offriendship. I say, that your foresight, councell and deliberation,gave Sophronia to Gisippus, a yong Gentleman, and a Philosopher:Gisippus likewise hath given her to a yong Gentleman, and aPhilosopher, as himselfe is. Your discretion gave her to anAthenian; the gift of Gisippus, is to a Romaine. Yours, to a Noble andhonest man; that of Gisippus, to one more Noble by race, and nolesse honest then himselfe. Your judgement hath bestowed her on a richyoung man: Gisippus hath given her to one farre richer. Yourwisedome gave her to one who not onely loved her not, but also onethat had no desire to know her: Gisippus gave her unto him, who, aboveall felicitie else, yea, more than his owne life, both entirelyloved and desired her.

　　"Now, for proofe of that which I have said, to be most true andinfallible, and that his deede deserveth to bee much more commendedthen yours, let it bee duely considered on, point by point. That Iam a young man and a Philosophe, as Gisippus is; my yeares, face,and studies, without seeking after further proofe, doth sufficientlytestifie: One selfe-same age is both his and mine, in like qualityof course have wee lived and studied together. True it is, that hee isan Athenian, and I am a Romaine. But if the glory of these twoCities should bee disputed on: then let mee tell you, that I am of aCitie that is Francke and Free, and hee is of a Tributarie Citie. Isay that I am of a Citie, which is chiefe Lady and Mistresse of thewhole World and hee is of a Citie subject to mine. I say that I amof a Citie, that is strong in Arms, Empire, and studies: whereas hiscan commend it selfe but for Studies onely. And although you seemeheere to bee a Scholler, in appearance meane enough, yet I am notdescended of the simplest stocke in Rome.

　　"My houses and publique places, are filled with the ancientStatues of my Predecessors, and the Annales recorde the infinitetriumphs of the Quintij, brought home by them into the RomaneCapitole, and yeares cannot eate out the glory of our name, but itwill live and flourish to all posteritie.

　　"Modest shame makes me silent in my wealth and possessions, my mindetruely telling mee, that honest contented povertie, is the mostancient and richest inheritance, of our best and Noblest Romanes,which opinion, if it bee condemned by the understanding of theignorant multitude, and heerein wee shall give way to them bypreferring riches and worldly treasures, then I can say that I amaboundantly provided, not as ambitious, or greedily covetous, butsufficiently stored with the goods of Fortune.

　　"I know well enough, that you held it as a desired benefit, Gisippusbeing a Native of your Citie, should also be linked to you byalliance: but I know no reason, why I should not be as neere and deereto you at Rome, as if I lived with you heere. Considering, when I amthere, you have a ready and well wishing friend, to stead you in allbeneficiall and serviceable offices, as carefull and provident foryour support, yea, a protectour of you and your affaires, as wellpublique as particular. Who is it then, not transported withpartiall affection, that can (in reason) more approve your act, thenthat which my friend Gisippus hath done? Questionlesse, not any one,as I thinke. Sophronia is married to Titus Quintus Fulvius, a NobleGentleman by antiquitie, a rich Citizen of Rome, and (which is aboveall) the friend of Gisippus: therfore, such a one as thinkes itstrange, is sorrie for it, or would not have it to be; knoweth notwhat he doth.

　　"Perhaps there may be some, who will say, they doe not so muchcomplain, that Sophronia is the wife to Titus; but of the mannerwhereby it was done, as being made his wife secretly, and by theft,not any of her parents, kinred or friends called thereto: no, nor somuch as advertised thereof. Why Gentlemen, this is no miraculousthing, but heeretofore hath oftentimes happened, and therefore nonoveltie.

　　"I cannot count unto you, how many there have beene, who (againstthe will of their Fathers) have made choice of their husbands; northem that have fled away with their lovers into strange Countries,being first friends, before they were wives:

　　nor of them who have sooner made testimonie of marriage by theirbellies, then those ceremonies due to matrimonie, or publicationthereof by the tongue; so that meere necessity and constraint, hathforced the parents to yeeld consent: which hath not so happened toSophronia, for she was given to me by Gisippus discreetly, honestly,and orderly.

　　"Others also may say, that shee is married to him, to whom itbelonged not to marrie her. These complaints are foolish, andwomanish, proceeding from verie little, or no consideration at all. Inthese daies of ours, Fortune makes no use of novell or inconsideratemeanes, whereby to bring matters to their determined effect. Whyshould it offend me, if a Cobler, rather than a Scholler, hath ended abusinesse of mine, either in private or publique, if the end be wellmade? Well I may take order, if the Cobler bee indiscreet, that heemeddle no more with any matters of mine, yet I ought, in courtesie, tothanke him for that which hee did.

　　"In like manner, if Gisippus hath married Sophronia well, it isfoolish and superfluous, to finde fault with the manner hee used inher marriage. If you mislike his course in the case, beware of himhereafter, yet thanke him because it is no worse. "Neverthelesse,you are to understand, that I sought not by fraud or deceit, (butonely by witte) any opportunitie, whereby any way to sullie thehonestie and cleere Nobilitie of your bloud, in the person ofSophronia: for although in secret I made her my wife, yet I came notas an enemie, to take her perforce, nor (like a ravisher) wrongedher virginitie, to blemish your no. titles, or despising youralliance. But fervently, enflamed by her bright beauty, and incitedalso by her unparalleld vertues, I shaped my course; knowing wellenough, that if I tooke the ordinarie way of wiving, by moving thequestion to you, I should never winne your consent, as fearing, lest Iwould take her with me to Rome, and so conveigh out of your sight, ajewell by you so much esteemed, as she is.

　　"For this, and no other reason, did I presume to use the secretcunning which now is openly made knowne unto you: and Gisippusdisposed himselfe thereunto, which otherwise hee never determined tohave done, in contracting the marriage for me, and shee consentingto me in his name.

　　Moreover, albeit most earnestly I affected her, I sought toprocure your union, not like a lover, but as a true husband, nor wouldI immodestly touch her, till first (as her selfe can testifie) withthe words becomming wedlocke, and the Ring also I espoused her,demanding of her, if shee would accept mee as her husband, and sheeanswered mee, with her full consent. Wherein, if it may seeme thatshee was deceived, I am not any way to be blamed, but she, for notdemanding, what, and who I was.

　　This then is the great evill, the great offence, and the greatinjurie committed by my friend Gisippus, and by mee as a Lover: thatSophronia is secretly become the wife of Titus Quintus Fulvius. Andfor this cause, like spies you watch him, threaten him daily, as ifyou intended to teare him in pieces. What could you doe more, if heehad given her to a man of the very vilest condition? to a villaine, toa slave? What prisons? what fetters? Or what torments are sufficientfor this fact? But leaving these frivolous matters, let us come todiscourse of more moment, and better beseeming your attention.

　　The time is come, that I may no longer continue heere, becausePublius my Father is dead, and I must needs returne to Rome, whereforebeing minded to take Sophronia thither with mee, I was the morewilling to acquaint you therewith, as also what else I have said,which otherwise had still beene concealed from you. Nor can you buttake it in good part, if you be wise, and rest well contented withwhat is done: considering, if I had any intention eyther to deceive,or otherwise wrong you, I could have basely left her, and made ascorne both of her and you, you not having any power to stay meeheere. But the Gods will never permitte that any couragious Romane,should ever conceive so vile and degenerate a thought.

　　Sophronia, by ordination of the Gods, by force of humane Lawes,and by the laudable consent of my friend Gisippus, as also thepowerfull command of Love is mine. But you perchance, imagining yourselves to be wiser then the Gods, or any other men whatsoever; maythinke ill of it, and more brutishly then beasts, condemne theirworking in two kinds, which would be offensive to mee. The one is,your detaining of Sophronia from mee, of whom you have no power, butwhat pleaseth mee. The other, is your bitter threatnings againstGisippus my deare friend, to whom you are in duty obliged. In bothwhich cases, how unreasonablie soever you carrie your selves, I intendnot at this time to presse any further. But rather let mee counsellyou like a friend, to cease your hatred and disdaine, and sufferSophronia to be delivered mee, that I may depart contentedly fromyou as a kinsman, and (being absent) remaine your friend: assuringyou, that whether what is done shall please or displease you, if youpurpose to proceed any otherwise: I will take Gisippus along with me,,and when I come to Rome, take such sure order, to fetch her hence, whoin justice is mine, even in meere despight of you all, and then youshall feele by sound experience, how powerfull is the just indignationof the wronged Romanes."

　　When Titus had thus concluded his Oration, he arose with a sterneand discontented countenance, and tooke Gisippus by the hand,plainly declaring, that he made small account of all the rest thatwere in the Temple; and shaking his head at them, rather menacedthen any other wise seemed to care for them.

　　They which tarried, when they were gone, considering partly on thereasons alleadged by Titus, and partly terrified by his latestspeeches; became induced, to like well of his alliance and amitie,as (with common consent) they concluded: that it was much better toaccept Titus as their kinsman (seeing Gisippus had made manifestrefusall thereof) than to lose the kinred of the one, and procurethe hatred of the other. Wherefore they went to seeke Titus, andsaid unto him, they were very well contented that Sophronia should beehis Wife, hee their deare and loving kinsman, and Gisippus toremaine their much respected friend. And embracing one another, makinga solemne feast, such as in the like cases is necessarilie required,they departed from him, presently sending Sophronia to him, who makinga vertue of necessity, converted her love (in short time after) toTitus, in as effectuall manner, as formerly shee had done to Gisippus,and so was sent away with him to Rome, where she was received andwelcommed with very great honour.

　　Gisippus remaining still at Athens, in small regard of eyther theirsor his owne friends: not long after by meanes of sundry troublesomeCitizens; and partialities happening among the common people, wasbanished from Athens, and hee, as also all his familie, condemned toperpetuall exile: during which tempestuous time, Gisippus was becomenot onely wretchedly poore, but wandred abroad as a common begger;in which miserable condition he travelled to Rome, to try if Tituswould take any acknowledgement of him. Understanding that he wasliving, and one most respected among the Romanes, as being a greatCommander and a Senator: he enquired for the place where hee dwelt,and going to be neere about his house, stayed there so long, tillTitus came home, yet not daring to manifest himselfe, or speake a wordto him, in regard of his poore and miserable estate, but strove tohave him see him, to the end, that hee might acknowledge and callhim by his name; notwithstanding, Titus passed by him without eitherspeech, or looking on him: Which when Gisippus perceived, and makingfull account, that (at the least) he would remember him, in regardof former courtesies, done to him: confounded with griefe anddesperate thoughtes, hee departed thence, never meaning to see him anymore.

　　Now, in regard it was night, he having eaten nothing all that day,nor provided of one penny to buy him any food, wandred he knew notwhether, desiring rather to die than live; hee came at last to anold ruinous part of the City, over-spred with briers and bushes, andseldome resorted unto by any: where finding a hollow Cave or vault, heentred into it, meaning there to weare away the comfortlesse night,and laying himselfe downe on the hard ground, almost starke naked, andwithout any warme garments, over-wearied with weeping, at last he fellinto a sleepe.

　　It fortuned that two men, who had beene abroad the same night,committing thefts and robberies together; somwhat very earlie in themorning, came to the same Cave, intending there to share and dividetheir booties, and difference happening betweene them about it, heethat was the stronger person, slew there the other, and then went awaywith the whole purchase.

　　Gisippus having heard and seene the manner of this accident, was nota little joyfull, because he had now found a way to death, withoutlaying any violent hand on himselfe; for life being very loathsometo him, it was his only desire to die. Wherfore, he would not budgefrom the place, but taried there so long, till the Sergeants andOfficers of justice (by information of him that did the deede) camethither well attended, and furiously ledde Gisippus thence to prison.

　　Being examined concerning this bloudy fact, he plainly confessed,that hee himselfe had committed the murder, and afterward would notdepart from the Cave, but purposely stayed for apprehension, asbeing truely toucht with compunction for so foule an offence: uponwhich eremptorie confession, Marcus Varro being then Praetor, gavesentence that he should be crucified on a Crosse, as it was the usuallmanner of death in those dayes. Titus chancing to come at the sametime into Praetorium, advisedly beholding the face of the condemnedman (as hee sate upon the bench) knew him to bee Gysippus, not alittle wondring at this strange accident, the povertie of hisestate, and what occasion should bring him thither, especially inthe questioning for his life, and before the Tribunall of justice.

　　His soule earnestly thirsting, by all possible meanes to helpe anddefend him, and no other course could now be taken for safetie ofhis life, but by accusing himselfe, to excuse and cleare the otherof the crime: hee stept from off the judgement bench, and croudingthrough the throng to the Barre, called out to the Praetor in thismanner. Marcus Varro, recall thy sentence given on the condemned mansent away, because hee is truely guiltlesse and innocent: With onebloudie blow have I offended the Gods, by killing that wretched man,whom the Serjeants found this morning slaine, wherefore Noble Praetor,let no innocent mans bloud be shed for it, but onely mine that haveoffended.

　　Marcus Varro stood like a man confounded with admiration, being verysorrie, for that which the whole assistants had both seene andheard, yet hee could not (with honour) desist from what must needsbe done, but would performe the Lawes severe injunction. And sendingfor condemned Gisippus backe againe, in the presence of Titus, thus hespake to him. How becamest thou so madly incensed, as (without anytorment inflicted on thee) to confesse an offence by thee nevercommitted? Art thou wearie of thy life? Thou chargest thy selfefalsly, to be the person who this last night murdered the man in theCave, and there is another that voluntarily also doth confesse hisguiltinesse.

　　Gisippus lifting up his eyes, and perceiving it was Titus, conceivedimmediately, that he had done this onely for his deliverance, as onethat remembred him sufficiently, and would not be ungratefull forformer kindnesses received. Wherefore, the teares flowing abundantlydown his cheekes, he said to the Judge Varro, it was none but I thatmurdered the man, wherefore, I commiserate the case of this NobleGentleman Titus, who speakes now too late for the safety of my life.Titus on the other side, said. Noble Praetor, this man (as thou seest)is a stranger heere, and was found without any weapon, fast asleepe bythe dead body: thou mayst then easily perceive, that meerely themiserable condition wherein he is, hath made him desperate, and hewould make mine offence the occasion of his death. Absolve him, andsend me to the Crosse, for none but I have deserved to die for thisfact.

　　Varro was amazed, to observe with what earnest instance each of themstrove to excuse the other, which halfe perswaded him in his soule,that they were both guiltlesse. And as he was starting-up, with fullintent to acquaint them: a yong man, who had stood there all thiswhile, and observed the hard pleading on either side; he crowdedinto the Barre, being named Publius Ambustus, a fellow of lewd life,and utterly out of hopes, as being debauched in all his fortunes,and knowne among the Romaines to be a notorious theefe, who verily hadcommitted the murder. Well knew his conscience, that none of them wereguilty of the crime, wherewith each so wilfully charged himselfe:being therefore truely toucht with remorse, he stept before MarcusVarro, saying.

　　Honourable Praetor, mine owne horrid and abominable actions, haveinduced me thus to intrude my selfe, for clearing the strictcontention betweene these two persons. And questionlesse, some Godor greater power, hath tormented my wretched soule, and socompunctually solicited me, as I cannot chuse, but make openconfession of my sinne. Here therefore, I doe apparantly publish, thatneither of these men is guilty of the offence, wherewith so wilfullyeach chargeth himselfe. I am the villaine, who this morning murderedthe man in the Cave, one of no greater honesty then my selfe, andseeing this poore man lie there sleeping, while we were dividing thestolne booties betweene us; I slew my Companyon, because I would bethe sole possessor. As for Noble Lord Titus, he had no reason thusto accuse himselfe, because [he] is a man of no such base quality: letthem both then be delivered, and inflict the sentence of death on me.

　　Octavius Caesar, to whom tydings was brought of this rareaccident, commanding them al three to be brought before him; wouldneeds understand the whole History, in every particular as all hadhappened, which was substantially related to him. Whereupon,Octavius pleased them all three: the two noble friendes, becausethey were innocent, and the third, for openly revealing the verytruth.

　　Titus tooke home with him his friend Gisippus, and after he hadsharpely reproved him for his distrust, and cold credence of hisfriendship: he brought him to Sophronia, who welcomed him as lovingly,as if he had bin her naturall borne brother, bemoaning his hard anddisastrous fortune, and taking especiall care, to convert all passeddistresses, into as happy and comfortable a change, fitting him withgarments and attendants, beseeming his degree both in Nobility andvertue. Titus, out of his honourable bounty, imparted halfe hislands and rich possessions to him, and afterward gave him in marriage,his owne Sister, a most beautifull Lady, named Fulvia, saying to himbeside. My deare friend Gisippus, it remaineth now in thine owneelection, whether thou wilt live here still with me, or returnebacke to Athens, with all the wealth which I have bestowed on thee.But Gisippus, being one way constrayned, by the sentence of banishmentfrom his native City, and then againe, in regard of the constant love,which he bare to so true and thankefull friend as Titus was: concludedto live there as a loyall Roman, where he with his Fulvia, and Tituswith his faire Sophronia, lived long after together in one and thesame house, augmenting daily (if possible it might be) their amitybeyond all other equalizing.

　　A most sacred thing therefore is (ordiall amity, worthy not onely ofsinguler reverence, but also to be honoured with eternallcommendation, as being the onely wise Mother of all magnificence andhonesty, the Sister of Charity and Gratitude, the enemy to hatredand avarice, and which is alwayes ready (without attending to berequested) to extend all vertuous actions to others, which she wouldhave done to her selfe. Her rare and divine effects, in these contrarytimes of ours, are not to be found between two such persons, whichis a mighty fault, and greatly checketh the miserable covetousnesse ofmen, who respecting nothing but onely their particular benefit; havebanished true Amity, to the utmost confines of the whole earth, andsent her into perpetuall exile.

　　What love, what wealth, or affinity of kindred, could have madeGisippus feele (even in the intyrest part of his soule) the ferventcompassion, the teares, the sighes of Titus, and with such efficacy asplainely appeared: to make him consent, that his faire elected Spouse,by him so dearely esteemed, should become the wife of his Companion,but onely the precious league of Amity?

　　What Lawes, what threatnings, what feares, could cause the yongarmes of Gisippus to abstaine embraces, betaking himselfe tosolitary walkes, and obscure places, when in his owne bedde, hemight have enjoyed so matchlesse a beauty (who perhaps desired it somuch as himselfe) but onely the gracious title of Amity? Whatgreatnesse, what merits or precedence, could cause Gisippus not tocare, for the losse of his kindred, those of Sophronia, yea, ofSophronia her selfe, not respecting the dishonest murmurings of baseminded people, their vile and contemptible language, scornes andmockeries, and all to content and satisfie a friend, but onelyDivine Amity?

　　Come now likewise to the other side. What occasions could compellNoble Titus, so promptly and deliberatly, to procure his owne death,to rescue his friend from the crosse, and inflict the pain and shameupon himselfe, pretending not [to] see or know Gisippus at all, had itnot bin wrought by powerfull Amity? What cause else could make Titusso liberall, in dividing (with such willingnesse) the larger part ofhis patrimony to Gisippus, when Fortune had dispossest him of hisowne, but onely heaven-borne Amity? What else could have procuredTitus, without any further dilation, feare or suspition, to give hisSister Fulvia in marriage to Gisippus, when he saw him reduced to suchextreame poverty, disgrace and misery, but onely infinite Amity? Towhat end doe men care then, to covet and procure great multitudes ofkinred, store of brethren, numbers of children, and to encrease(with their owne monyes) plenty of servants: when by the least losseand dammage happening, they forget all duty to Father, Brother, orMaster? Amity and true friendship is of a quite contrary nature,satisfying (in that sacred bond) the obligation due to all degrees,both of parentage, and all alliences else.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE NINTH NOVELL

　　DECLARING WHAT AN HONOURABLE VERTUE COURTESIE IS, IN THEM

　　THAT TRUELY KNOW HOW TO USE THEM

　　Saladine, the great Soldan of Babylon, in the habite of aMerchant, was honourably received and welcommed, into the house ofSignior Thorello d'Istria. Who travelling to the Holy Land, prefixed acertaine time to his Wife, for his returne back to her againe,wherein, if he failed, it was lawfull for her to take another Husband.By clouding himselfe in the disguise of a Faulkner, the Soldan tookenotice of him, and did him many great honours. Afterward, Thorellofalling sicke, by Magicall Art, he was conveighed in one night toPavia, when his Wife was to be married on the morrow: where makinghimselfe knowne to her, all was disappointed, and shee went homewith him to his owne house.

　　Adam Philomena having concluded her discourse, and the rareacknowledgement, which Titus made of his esteemed friend Gisippus,extolled justly as it deserved by all the Company: the King, reservingthe last office to Dioneus (as it was at the first granted him)began to speake thus. Without all question to the contrary (worthyLadies) nothing can be more truely said, then what Madame Philomena,hath delivered, concerning Amity, and her complaint in theconclusion of her Novell, is not without great reason, to see it soslenderly reverenced and respected (now a dayes) among all men. But ifwe had met here in duty onely for correcting the abuses of iniquity,and the malevolent courses of this preposterous age; I could proceedfurther in this just cause of complaint. But because our end aimeth atmatters of other nature, it commeth to my memory to tel you of aHistory, which (perhaps) may seeme somewhat long, but altogetherpleasant, concerning a magnificent act of great Saladine: to theend, that by observing those things which you shall heare in myNovell, if we cannot (by reason of our manifold imperfections)intirely compasse the amity of any one; yet (at least) we may takedelight, in stretching our kindnesse (in good deeds) so farre as weare able, in hope one day after, some worthy reward will ensuethereon, as thereto justly appertaining.

　　Let me tell you then, that (as it is afermed by many) in the time ofthe Emperour Frederick, first of that name, the Christians, for thebetter recovery of the holy land, resolved to make a generall voyageover the Seas. Which being understood by Saladine, a very worthyPrince, and then Soldan of Babylon: he concluded with himselfe, thathe would (in person) goe see, what preparation the ChristianPotentates made for this Warre, that hee might the better providefor himselfe. Having setled all things orderly in Aegypt for thebusines, and making an outward appearance, as if he purposed apilgrimage to Mecha: he set onward on his journey, habited like aMerchant, attended onely with two of his most Noble and wisestBaschaes, and three waiting servants.

　　When he had visited many Christian Provinces, and was ridingthorow Lombardle, to passe the mountaines; it fortuned, in hisjourneying from Millaine to Pavia, and the day being very farre spent,so that night hastened speedily on him: he met with a Gentleman, namedSignior Thorella d'Istria, but dwelling at Pavia, who with his men,Hawkes and Hounds, went to a house of his, seated in a singular place,and on the River of Ticinum. Signior Thorello seeing such men makingtowardes him, presently imagined, that they were someGentle-strangers, and such hee desired to respect with honor.

　　Wherefore, Saladine demanding of one of Thorelloes men, how farre(as then) it was to Pavia, and whether they might reach thither bysuch an houre, as would admit their entrance into the Citty:Thorello would not suffer his servant to returne the answer, butreplyed thus himselfe. Sir (quoth he) you cannot reach Pavia, butnight will abridge you of any entraunce there. I beseech you then Sir,answered Saladine, favour us so much (because we are all strangersin these parts) as to tell us where we may be well lodged. That shal ISir, said Thorello, and very gladly too.

　　Even at the instant Sir, as we met with you, I had determined inmy mind, to send one of my servants somewhat neere to Pavia, about abusinesse concerning my selfe: he shall go along with you, and conductyou to a place, where you will be very well entertayned. So,stepping to him, who was of best discretion amongst his men, he gaveorder to him what should bee done, and sent him with them. Himselfe,making hast by a farre neerer way, caused Supper to be prepared inworthy manner, and the Tables to be covered in his Garden; and allthings being in good readinesse, he sate downe at his doore, to attendthe comming of his guests. The Servingman, discoursing with theGentlemen on divers occasions, guided them by such unusuallpassages, as (before they could discerne it) he brought them to hisMasters house; where so soone as Thorello saw them arrived, he wentforth to meet them, assuring them all of most hearty welcome.

　　Saladine, who was a man of accute understanding, did wellperceive, that this Knight Thorello misdoubted his going with him,if (when he met him) hee should have invited him; and therefore,because he would not be denied, of entertaining him into his house; hemade choise of this kinde and honourable course, which caused him toreturne this answer. Gentle Sir, if courtesie in one man to another,do deserve condemning, then may we justly complaine of you, whomeeting us upon the way, which you have shortened by your kindnesse,and which we are no way able to deserve, wee are constrained toaccept, taking you to bee the mirrour of courtesie. Thorello being aKnight of ingenious apprehension, and wel languaged, replyed thus.

　　Gentlemen; this courtesie (seeing you terme it so) which you receiveof me, in regard of that justly belonging to you, as your faces dosufficiently informe mee, is matter of very slender account. Butassuredly out of Pavia, you could not have any lodging, deserving tobe termed good. And therefore let it not bee displeasing to you, ifyou have a little gone forth of the common rode way, to have yourentertainment somewhat bettered, as many travaylers are easily inducedto do.

　　Having thus spoken, all the people of the house shewed themselves,in serviceable manner to the Gentlemen, taking their horses as theydismounted, and Thorello himselfe, conducted the three Gentlemen, intothree severall faire Chambers, which in costly maner were prepared forthem, where their boots were pluckt off, faire Napkins with Manchetslay ready, and delicate Wines to refresh their wearied spirits, muchprety conference being entercoursed, til Supper time invited themthence.

　　Saladine, and they that were with him, spake the Latine tonguevery readily, by which meanes they were the better understoode; andThorello seemed (in their judgement) to bee the most gracious,compleate, and best spoken Gentleman, as ever they met with in alltheir journey. It appeared also (on the other side) to SigniourThorello, that his guests were men of great merit, and worthy ofmuch more esteeme, then there he could use towards them: wherefore, itdid highly distast him, that he had no more friends there this nightto keepe them company, or himselfe better provided for theirentertainment, which hee intended (on the morrow) to recompence withlarger amends at dinner.

　　Heereupon, having instructed one of his men with what heeintended, he sent him to Pavia, which was not farre off (and wherehe kept no doore shut) to his Wife, named Madam Adialetta; a Womansingularly wise, and of a Noble spirit, needing little or nodirection, especially when she knew her husbands minde. As they werewalking in the Garden, Thorello desired to understand, of whence,and what they were? Whereto Saladine thus answered. Sir, wee areCyprian Marchants, comming now from Cyprus, and are travalling toParis, about affaires of importance. Now trust me Syr, replyedThorello, I could heartily wish, that this Countrey of ours wouldyeeld such Gentlemen, as your Cyprus affordeth Marchants. So,falling from one discourse unto another, Supper was served in; andlooke howe best themselves pleased, so they sate at the Table, where(we need make no doubt) they were respected in honourable order.

　　So soone as the Tables were withdrawne, Thorello knowing theymight be weary, brought them againe to their Chambers, wherecommitting them to their good rest, himselfe went to bed sooneafter. The Servant sent to Pavia, delivered the message to his Lady;who, not like a woman of ordinary disposition, but rather truelyRoyall, sent Thorelloes servants into the City, to make preparationfor a Feast indeed, and with lighted Torches (because it wassomewhat late) they invited the very greatest and noblest persons ofthe Citie, all the roomes being hanged with the richest Arras, Clothesand Golde worke, Velvets, Silkes, and all other rich adornments, insuch manner as her husband had commanded, and answerable to her owneworthy mind, being no way to learne, in what manner to entertainestrangers.

　　On the morrow morning, the Gentlemen arose, and mounting onhorsebacke with Signior Thorello, he called for his Hawkes and Hounds,brought them to the River, where he shewed two or three faire flights:but Saladine desiring to know, which was the fayrest Hostery in allPavia, Thorello answered. Gentlemen, I wil shew you that my selfe,in regard I have occasion to ride thither. Which they beleeving,were the better contented, and rode on directly unto Pavia; arrivingthere about nine of the clocke, and thinking he guided them to thebest Inne, he brought them to his owne house; where, above fifty ofthe worthiest Citizens, stood ready to welcome the Gentlemen,imbracing them as they lighted from their Horsses. Which Saladine, andhis associates perceiving, they guessed as it was indeede, andSaladine sayd. Beleeve me worthy Thorello, this is not answerable tomy demand; you did too much yester night, and much more then wecould desire or deserve: Wherefore, you might wel be the soonerdischarged of us, and let us travaile on our journey.

　　Noble Gentlemen, replyed Thorello (for in mine eye you seeme nolesse) that courtesie which you met with yester-night, I am tothanke Fortune for, more then you, because you were then straited bysuch necessity, as urged your acceptance of my poore Country house.But now this morning, I shall account my selfe much beholding to you(as the like will all these worthy Gentlemen here about you) if you dobut answer kindnes with kindnes, and not refuse to take a homelydinner with them.

　　Saladine and his friends, being conquerd with such potentperswasions, and already dismounted from their horses, saw that alldeniall was meerly in vaine: and therefore thankfully condiscending(after some few ceremonious complements were over-past) theGentlemen conducted them to their Chambers, which were mostsumptuously prepared for them, and having laid aside their ridinggarments, being a little re reshed with Cakes and choice Wines; theydescended into the dining Hall, the pompe whereof I am not able toreport.

　　When they had washed, and were seated at the Tables, dinner wasserved in most magnificent sort; so that if the Emperor himself hadbin there, he could not have bin more sumptuously served. And althoughSaladine and his Baschaes were very Noble Lords, and wonted to seematters of admiration: yet could they do no lesse now, but ratherexceeded in marvaile, considering the qualitie of the Knight, whomthey knew to bee a Citizen, and no Prince or great Lord. Dinnerbeing ended, and divers familiar conferences passing amongst them:because it was exceeding hot, the Gentlemen of Pavia (as it pleasedThorello to appoint) went to repose themselves awhile, and hekeeping company with his three guests, brought them into a goodlyChamber, where, because he would not faile in the least scruple ofcourtesie, or conceale from them the richest jewell which he had; hesent for his Lady and wife, because (as yet) they had not seene her.

　　She was a Lady of extraordinary beauty, tall stature, verysumptuously attired, and having two sweet Sonnes (resembling Angels)she came with them waiting before her, and graciously saluted herguests.

　　At her comming, they arose, and having received hir with greatreverence, they seated her in the midst, kindly cherishing the twoChildren. After some gracious Language past on eyther side, shedemanded of whence, and what they were, which they answered in thesame kind as they had done before to her husband. Afterward, with amodest smiling countenance, she sayd. Worthy Gentlemen, let not myweake Womanish discretion appeare distastable, in desiring to craveone especiall favour from you, namely, not to refuse or disdaine asmall gift, wherewith I purpose to present you. But considering first,that women (according to their simple faculty) are able to bestowbut silly gifts: so you would be pleased, to respect more the personthat is the giver, then the quality or quantity of the gift.

　　Then causing to be brought (for each of them) two goodly gowns orRobes (made after the Persian manner) the one lyned thorough withcloth of Gold, and the other with the costlyest Fur; not after suchfashion as Citizens or Marchants use to weare, but rather beseemingLords of greatest account, and three light under-wearing Cassocks orMandillions, of Carnatian Sattin, richly Imbroidred with Gold andPearles, and lined thorow with White Taffata, presenting these giftsto him, she sayd. I desire you Gentlemen to receive these meanetrifies, such as you see my Husband weares the like, and these otherbeside, considering you are so far from your Wives, having travailed along way already, and many miles more yet to overtake; alsoMarchants (being excellent men) affect to be comely and handsome intheir habits; although these are of slender value, yet (innecessity) they may do you service.

　　Now was Saladine and his Baschaes halfe astonyed with admiration, atthe magnificent minde of Signiour Thorello, who would not forget theleast part of courtesie towardes them, and greatly doubted (seeing thebeauty and riches of the Garments) least they were discovered byThorello. Neverthelesse, one of them thus answered the Lady. Beleeveme Madame, these are rich guiftes, not lightly either to be given,rich or receyved: but in regard of your strict imposition, we arenot able to deny them. This being done, with most gracious andcourteous demeanour, she departed from them, leaving her Husband tokeepe them still companie; who furnished their servants also, withdivers worthy necessaries fitting for their journey.

　　Afterward, Thorello (by very much importunitie) wonne them to staywith him all the rest of the day; wherefore, when they had restedthemselves awhile, being attyred in their newly given robes; they rodeon Horsebacke thorow the Citty. When supper time came, they supt inmost honourable and worthy company, beeing afterwards Lodged in mostfaire and sumptuous Chambers, and being risen in the morning, inexchange of their horses (over-wearied with Travaile) they found threeother very richly furnished, and their men also in like mannerprovided. Which when Saladine had perceyved, he tooke his Baschaesaside, and spake in this manner.

　　By our greatest Gods, I never met with any man, more compleat in allnoble perfections, more courteous and kinde then Thorello is. If allthe Christian Kings, in the true and heroicall nature of Kings, dodeale as honourably as I see this Knight doeth, the Soldane of Babylonis not able to endure the comming of one of them, much lesse somany, as wee see preparing to make head against us. But beholding,that both refusall and acceptation, was all one in the minde ofThorello: after much kinde Language had bin intercoursed betweenethem, Saladine (with his Attendants) mounted on horsebacke.

　　Signiour Thorello, with a number of his honourable Friends (to thenumber of an hundred Horsse) accompanied them a great distance fromthe Citie, and although it greeved Saladine exceedingly, to leavethe company of Thorello, so dearely he was affected to him: butnecessity (which controlleth the power of all lawes whatsoever) mustneeds divide them: yet requesting his returne agayne that way, ifpossibly it might be granted; which Saladine promised but did notperforme. Well Gentlemen (quoth Thorello at parting) I know not whatyou are, neither (against your will) do I desire it: but whether yoube Marchants or no remember me in your kindnesse, and so to theheavenly powers I commend you. Saladine, having taken his leave of allthem that were with Thorello, returned him this answer. Sir, it mayone day hereafter so happen, as we shal let you see some of ourMarchandises, for the better confirmation of your beleefe, and ourprofession.

　　Thus parted Signior Thorello and his friends, from Saladine andhis company, who verily determined in the heighth of his minde, ifhe should be spared with life, and the warre (which he expected)concluded: to requite Thorello with no lesse courtesie, then hee hadalready declared to him; conferring a long while after with hisBaschaes, both of him and his beauteous Lady, not forgetting any oftheir courteous actions, but gracing them all with deservedcommendation. But after they had (with very laborious paines) surveyedmost of the Westerne parts, they all tooke Shipping, and returned intoAlexandria: sufficiently informed, what preparation was to be made fortheir owne defence. And Signior Thorello being come backe againe toPavia, consulted with his privat thoughts (many times after) whatthese three travailers should be, but came farre short of knowingthe truth, till (by experience) hee became better informed.

　　When the time was come, that the Christians were to make theirpassage, and wonderfull great preparations, in all places performed:Signiour Thorello, notwithstanding the teares and intreaties of hisWife, determined to be one in so woorthy and honourable a voyage:and having made his provision ready, nothing wanting but mounting onHorsebacke, to go where he should take shipping; to his Wife (whomhe most intirely affected) thus hee spake. Madame, I goe as thou seestin this famous Voyage, as well for mine Honour, as also the benefiteof my soule; all our goodes and possessions, I commit to thyvertuous care. And because I am not certaine of my returning backeagaine, in regard of a thousand accidents which may happen, in sucha Countrey as I goe unto: I desire onely but one favour of thee,whatsoever daunger shall befall mee; Namely, when any certaine tydingsshall be brought you of my death; to stay no longer before thysecond marriage, but one yeare, one month, and one day; to begin onthis day of my departing from thee.

　　The Lady, who wept exceedingly, thus answered. Alas Sir: I knownot how to carry my selfe, in such extremity of greefe, as now youleave me; but if my life surmount the fortitude of sorrow, andwhatsoever shall happen to you for certainty, either life or death:I will live and dye the Wife of Signiour Thorello, and make myobsequies in his memory onely. so Madame (replyed her Husband) not so;Be not overrash in promising any thing, albeit I am well assured, thatso much as consisteth in thy strength, I make no question of thyperformance. But consider withall (deare heart) thou art a yong woman,beautifull, of great parentage, and no way thereto inferior in theblessings of Fortune.

　　Thy Vertues are many, and universally both divulged and knowen, inwhich respect, I make no doubt; but divers and sundrie great Lords andGentlemen (if but the least rumor of my death be noysed) will makesulte for thee to thy parents and brethren, from whose violentsolicitings, wouldst thou never so resolutely make resistance, yetthou canst not be able to defend thy selfe; but whether thou wilt orno, thou must yeeld to please them; and this is the only reason, why Iwould tie thee to this limited time, and not one day or minute longer.

　　Adalietta, sweetly hugging him in her armes, and melting her selfein kisses, sighes, and teares on his face, said. Well Sir, I will doso much as I am able, in this your most kinde and loving imposition:and when I shall bee compelled to the contrary: yet rest thusconstantly assured, that I will not breake this your charge, so muchas in thought. Praying ever heartily to the heavenly powers, that theywill direct your course home againe to me, before your prefixeddate, or else I shall live in continual languishing. In the knittingup of this woful parting, embracing and kissing either infinittimes, the Lady tooke a Ring from off her finger, and giving it to herhusband, said. If I chaunce to die before I see you againe, rememberme when you looke on this. He receiving the Ring, and bidding allthe rest of his Friends farewell, mounted on horsebacke, and rode awaywel attended.

　　Being come unto Geneway, he and his company boorded a Galley, and(in few dayes after) arrived at Acres, where they joyned themselveswith the Christian Army, wherein there happened a verie dangerousmortality: During which time of so sharpe visitation (the causeunknowne whence it proceeded) whether thorough the industrie, orrather the good Fortune of Saladine, well-neere all the rest of theChristians (which escaped death) were surprized his prisoner(without a blow strucken) and sundred and imprisoned in diversTownes and Citties. Amongest the which number of prisoners, it wasSignior Thorelloes chaunce to be one, and walked in bonds toAlexandria, where being unknowne, and fearing least he should bediscovered: constrained thereto meerly by necessity, hee shewedhimselfe in the condition of a Faulconer; wherein he was veryexcellently experienced, and by which means his profession was madeknowne to Saladine, hee delivered out of prison, and created theSoldans Faulconer.

　　Thorello (whom the Soldane called by no other name, then theChristian, neyther of them knowing the other) sadly now remembredhis departure from Pavia, devising and practising many times, how hemight escape thence, but could not compasse it by any possible meanes.Wherefore, certaine Ambassadours beeing sent by the Genewayes, toredeeme divers Cittizens of theirs, there detained as prisoners, andbeing ready to returne home againe: he purposed to write to hisWife, that he was living, and wold repaire to her so soone as hecould, desiring the still continued rememberance of her limitedtime. By close and cunning meanes hee wrote the Letter, earnestlyintreating one of the Ambassadors (who knew him perfectly, but made nooutward apparance thereof) to deale in such sort for him, that theLetter might be delivered to the handes of the Abbot Di San Pietroin Ciel d'Oro, who was (indeede) his Unckle.

　　While Thorello remayned in this his Faulconers condition, itfortuned uppon a day, that Saladine, conversing with him about hisHawkes: Thorello chanced to smile, and used such a kinde of gesture ormotion with his Lippes, which Saladine (when he was in his house atPavia) had heedfully observed, and by this note, instantly heremembred Signior Thorello, and began to eye him very respectively,perswading himselfe that he was the same man. And therefore fallingfrom their former kinde of discoursing: Tell me: Christian (quothSaladine) what Country-man art thou of the West? Sir, answeredSigniour Thorello, I am by Country a Lombard, borne in a Cittycalled Pavia, a poore man, and of as poore condition.

　　So soone as Saladine had heard these Words; becomming assured inthat which (but now) he doubted, he saide within himselfe. Now theGods have given me time, wherein I may make knowne to this man, howthankefully I accepted his kinde courtesie, and cannot easily forgetit. Then, without saying any thing else, causing his Guard-robe tobe set open, he tooke him with him thither, and sayde. Christian,observe well all these Garments, and quicken thy remembrance, intelling mee truly, whether thou hast seene any of them before now,or no. Signiour Thorello looked on them all advisedly, and espyedthose two especiall Garments, which his Wife had given one of thestrange Merchants; yet he durst not credit it, or that possibly itcould be the same, neverthelesse he said. Sir, I doe not know any ofthem, but true it is, that these two doe resemble two such Robes, as Iwas wont to weare my selfe, and these (or the like) were given tothree Merchants, that happened to visite my poore house.

　　Now could Saladine containe no longer, but embracing him joyfully inhis armes, he said. You are Signior Thorello d'Istria, and I am one ofthose three Merchants to whom your Wife gave these Roabes: and now thetime is come to give you credible intelligence of my Merchandise, as Ipromised at my departing from you, for such a time (I told you)would come at length. Thorello, was both glad, and bashfulltogether: glad, that he had entertained such a Guest, and bashfullyashamed, that his welcome had not exceeded in more bountifullmanner. Thorello, replyed Saladine, seeing the Gods have sent you sohappily to me: account your selfe to be soly Lord here, for I am nowno more then a private man.

　　I am not able to expresse their counterchanges of courtesie,Saladine commanding him to be cloathed in Royall garments, andbrought into the presence of his very greatest Lords, where havingspoken liberally in his due commendation, he commanded them tohonour him as himselfe, if they expected any grace or favour from him,which every one did immediatly, but (above all the rest) those twoBaschaes, which accompanied Saladine at his house. The greatnesse ofthis pompe and glory, so suddenly throwne on Signior Thorello, madehim halfe forget all matters of Lomberdie; and so much the rather,because he had no doubt at all, but that his letters, were safely cometo the hands of his Uncle.

　　Here I am to tell you, that in the Campe or Army of theChristians, on the day when Saladine made his surprizal, there was aProvinciall Gentleman dead and buried, who was Signior Thorello deDignes, a man of very honourable and great esteeme, in which respect(Signior Thorello d'Istria, knowne throughout the Army, by hisNobility and valour) whosoever heard that Signior Thorello was dead:beleeved it to be Thorello d'Istria, and not he of Dignes, so thatThorello d'Istriaes unknowne surprizall and thraldome, made it also topasse for an assured truth.

　　Beside, many Italians returning home, and carrying this report forcredible; some were so audaciously presumptuous, as they avouched upontheir oathes, that not onely they saw him dead, but were present athis buriall likewise. Which rumour comming to the eare of his Wife,and likewise to his kinred and hers: procured a great and grievousmourning among them, and all that happened to heare thereof.

　　Over-tedious time it would require, to relate at large, the publiquegriefe and sorrow, with the continuall lamentations of his Wife, who(within some few moneths after) became tormented with new marriagesolicitings, before she had halfe sighed for the first: the verygreatest persons of Lomberdie making the motion, being dailyfollowed and furthered by her owne brothers and friends. Still(drowned in teares) she returned denyall, till in the end, when nocontradiction could prevaile, to satisfie her parents, and theimportunate pursuers: she was constrained to reveale, the chargeimposed on her by her Husband, which shee had vowed infallibly tokeepe, and till that very time, she would in no wise consent.

　　While wooing for a second wedding with Adalietta, proceeded inthis manner at Pavia, it chanced on a day, that Signior Thorello hadespied a man in Alexandria whom he saw with the GenewayAmbassadours, when they set thence towards Geneway with their Gallies.And causing him to be sent for, he demaunded of him, the successe ofthe voyage, and when the Gallies arrived at Geneway; whereto hereturned him this answere. My Lord, our Gallies made a very fatallvoyage, as it is (already) too well knowne in Creete, where mydwelling is. For when we drew neere Sicilie, there suddenly arose avery dangerous North-West-winde, which drove us on the quicke-Sands ofBarbarie, where not any man escaped with life, onely my selfeexcepted, but (in the wracke) two of my brethren perished.

　　Signior Thorello, giving credit to the mans words, because they weremost true indeed, and remembring also, that the time limitted to hisWife, drew neere expiring within very few dayes, and no newes nowpossibly to be sent thither of his life, his Wife wouldquestionlesse be marryed againe: he fell into such a deepe conceitedmelancholly, as food and sleepe forsooke him, whereupon, he kept hisbed, setting downe his peremptory resolution for death. WhenSaladine (who dearely loved him) heard thereof, he came in all hasteto see him, and having (by many earnest perswasions and entreaties)understood the cause of his melancholly and sickenesse: he veryseverely reproved him, because he could no sooner acquaint himtherewith. Many kind and comfortable speeches, he gave him, withconstant assurance, that (if he were so minded) he would so orderthe businesse for him; as he should be at Pavia, by the same time ashe had appointed to his Wife, and revealed to him also the manner how.

　　Thorello verily beleeved the Soldanes promise, because he hadoften heard the possibility of performance, and others had effected asmuch, divers times else-where: whereupon he began to comfort himselfe,soliciting the Soldan earnestly that it might be accomplished.Saladine sent for one of his Sorcerers (of whose skill he had formerlymade experience) to take a direct course, how Signior Thorelloshould be carryed (in one night) to Pavia, and being in his bed. TheMagitian undertooke to doe it, but, for the Gentlemans more ease, hemust first be possessed with an entraunced dead sleep. Saladinebeing thus assured of the deeds full effecting, he came againe toThorello, and finding him to be setled for Pavia (if possibly it mightbe accomplished by the determined time, or else no other expectationbut death) he said unto him as followeth.

　　Signior Thorello, if with true affection you love your Wife, andmisdoubt her marriage to some other man: I protest unto you, by thesupreme powers, that you deserve no reprehension in any mannerwhatsoever. For, of all the Ladyes that ever I have seene, she isthe onely woman, whose carriage, vertues, and civile speaking (settingaside beauty, which is but a fading flowre) deserveth mostgraciously to be respected, much more to be affected in the highestdegree. It were to me no meane favour of our Gods, (seeing Fortunedirected your course so happily hither) that for the short or longtime we have to live, we might reigne equally together in theseKingdomes under my subjection. But if such grace may not be grantedme, yet, seeing it stands mainly upon the perill of your life, to beat Pavia againe by your own limitted time, it is my chiefestcomfort, that I am therewith acquainted, because I intended to haveyou conveighed thither, yea, even into your owne house, in suchhonourable order as your vertues doe justly merit, which in regardit cannot be so conveniently performed, but as I have already informedyou, and as the necessity of the case urgently commandeth; accept itas it may be best accomplished.

　　Great Saladine (answered Thorella) effects (without words) havealready sufficiently warranted your Gracious disposition towards me,farre beyond any requitall remayning in me; your word onely beingenough for my comfort in this case, either dying or living. But inregard you have taken such order for my departure hence, I desire tohave it done with all possible expedition, because to morrow is thevery last day, that I am to be absent. Saladine protested that itshould be done, and the same evening in the great Hall of his Pallace,commanded a rich and costly Bedde to be set up, the mattras formedafter the Alexandrian manner, of Velvet and cloth Gold, the Quilts,counterpoints and coverings, sumptuously imbroydered with OrientPearles and Precious Stones, supposed to be of inestimable value,and two rarely wrought Pillowes, such as best beseemed so stately aBedde, the Curtaines and Vallans every way equall to the other pompe.

　　Which being done, he commanded that Thorello (who wasindifferently recovered) should be attyred in one of his ownesumptuous Saracine Roabes, the very fairest and richest that everwas seene, and on his head a Majesticall Turbant, after the mannerof his owne wearing, and the houre appearing to be somewhat late, hewith many of his best Baschaes, went to the Chamber where Thorellowas, and sitting downe a while by him, in teares thus he spake.Signior Thorello, the houre for sundering you and me, is now veryneere, and because I cannot beare you company, in regard of thebusinesse you goe about, and which by no meanes will admit it: I am totake my leave of you in this Chamber, and therefore am purposelycome to doe it. But before I bid you farewell, let me entreat you,by the love and friendship confirmed betweene us, to be mindfull ofme, and to take such order (your affaires being fully finished inLombardie) that I may once more enjoy the sight of you here, for amutuall solace and satisfaction of our mindes, which are now dividedby this urgent hast. Till which may be granted, let me want novisitation of your kind letters, commanding thereby of me,whatsoever here can possibly be done for you: assuring your selfe,no man living can command me as you doe.

　　Signior Thorello could not forbeare weeping, but being muchhindred therby, answered in few words. That he could not possiblyforget, his Gracious favours and extraordinary benefits used towardshim, but would accomplish whatsoever hee commaunded, according asheaven did enable him.

　　Hereupon, Saladine embracing him, and kissing his forehead, said.All my Gods goe with you, and guard you from any perill, departingso out of the Chamber weeping, and his Baschaes (having likewise takentheir leave of Thorello) followed Saladine into the Hall, whereasthe Bedde stood readily prepared? Because it waxed very late, andthe Magitian also there attending for his dispatch: the Phisitian wentwith the potion to Thorello, and perswading him, in the way offriendship, that it was onely to strengthen him after his greatweaknes: he drank it off, being thereby immediately entraunced, and sopresently sleeping, was (by Saladines command,) laid on thesumptuous and costly Bed, whereon stood an Imperiall Crowne ofinfinite value, appearing (by a description engraven on it) thatSaladine sent it to Madame Adalietta, the wife of Thorello. On hisfinger also hee put a Ring, wherein was enchased an admirableCarbuncle, which seemed like a flaming Torche, the value thereof notto bee estimated. By him likewise hee laid a rich sword, with thegirdle, hangers, and other furniture, such as seldome can be seene thelike. Then hee laid a jewell on the Pillow by him, so sumptuouslieembelished with Pearles and precious Stones, as might have beseemedthe greatest Monarch in the World to weare. Last of all, on eitherside of them, hee set two great Basons of pure Gold, full of doubleducates, many cords of Orient Pearles, Rings, Girdles, and othercostly jewells (over-tedious to bee recounted) and kissing him oncemore as hee lay in the bedde, commanded the Magitian to dispatch andbe gone.

　　Instantly, the bedde and Thorello in it, in the presence ofSaladine, was invisibly carried thence, and while he sate conferringwith his Baschaes, the bed, Signior Thorello, and all the rich Jewellsabout him, was transported and set in the Church of San Pietro in Cield'Ore in Pavia, according to his own request, and soundly sleeping,being placed directly before the high Altar. Afterward, when the bellsrung to Mattines, the Sexton entring the Church with a light in hishand (where hee beheld a light of greater splendor) and suddenlyespied the sumptuous bedde there standing: not only was he smitteninto admiration, but hee ranne away also very fearefully. When theAbbot and the Monkes mette him thus running into the Cloyster, theybecame amazed, and demanded the reason why he ranne in such haste,which the Sexton told them. How? quoth the Abbot, thou art nochilde, or a new-come hither, to be so easilie affrighted in ourholy Church, where Spirits can have no power to walke, God and SaintPeter (wee hope) are stronger for us then so: wherefore turne backewith us, and let us see the cause of thy feare.

　　Having lighted many Torches, the Abbot and his Monkes entred withthe Sexton into the Church, where they beheld the wonderful richebedde, and the Knight lying fast asleepe in it. While they stood allin amazement, not daring to approach neere the bedde, whereon lay suchcostly jewells: it chanced that Signior Thorello awaked, andbreathed forth a vehement sigh. The Monkes and the Abbot seeing him tostirre, ranne all away in feare, crying aloud, God and S. Peter defendus.

　　By this time Thorello had opened his eyes, and looking round abouthim, perceived that hee was in the place of Saladines promise, whereofhee was not a little joyfull. Wherefore, sitting up in the bedde,and particularly observing all the things about him: albeit he knewsufficiently the magnificence of Saladine, yet now it appeared fargreater to him, and imagined more largely thereof, then hee coulddoe before. But yet, without any other ceremony, seeing the flightof the Monkes, hearing their cry, and perceiving the reason; he calledthe Abbot by his name, desiring him not to be afraid, for he was hisNephew Thorello, and no other.

　　When the Abbot heard this, hee was ten times worse affrighted thenbefore, because (by publique fame) hee had beene so many monethsdead and buried; but receiving (by true arguments) better assurance ofhim, and hearing him still call him by his name: blessing himselfewith the signe of the Crosse, hee went somewhat neerer to the bed,when Thorello said. My loving Uncle, and religious holy Father, wherofare you afraid? I am your loving Nephew, newly returned from beyondthe Seas. The Abbot, seeing his beard to be grown long, and hishabit after the Arabian fashion, did yet collect some resemblance ofhis former countenance; and being better perswaded of him, tooke himby the hand, saying:

　　Sonne thou art happily returned, yet there is not any man in ourCitie, but doth verily beleeve thee to bee dead, and therefore doe notmuch wonder at our feare. Moreover, I dare assure thee, that thyWife Adalietta, being conquered by the controuling command, andthreatnings of her kinred (but much against her owne minde) is thisvery morning to be married to a new husband, and the marriage feast issolemnly prepared, in honour of this second nuptialls.

　　Thorello arising out of the bedde, gave gracious salutations tothe Abbot and his Monkes, intreating earnestly of them all, that noword might be spoken of his returne, untill he had compleated animportant businesse. Afterward, having safely secured the bedde, andall the rich Jewells, he fully acquainted the Abbot with all hispassed fortunes, whereof he was immeasurably joyfull, and havingsatisfied him, concerning the new elected husband, Thorello saidunto the Abbot. Unckle, before any rumour of my returne, I wouldgladly see my wives behavior at this new briding feast, and althoughmen of religion are seldome seene at such joviall meetings: yet (formy sake) doe you so order the matter, that I (as an Arabianstranger) may be a guest under your protection; wherto the Abbotvery gladly condescended.

　　In the morning, he sent to the Bridegroom, and advertised him,that he (with a stranger newly arrived) intended to dine with him,which the Gentleman accepted in thankefull manner. And when dinnertime came, Thorello in his strange disguise went with the Abbot to theBridegroomes house, where he was lookt on with admiration of all theguests, but not knowne or suspected by any one; because the Abbotreported him to be a Sarracine, and sent by the Soldane (in Ambassage)to the King of France. Thorello was seated at a by-table, but directlyopposite to the new Bride, whom hee much delighted to looke on, andeasily collected by her sad countenance, that shee was scarcely wellpleased with this new nuptialls. She likewise beheld him very often,not in regard of any knowlege she took of him: for the bushiness ofhis beard, strangeness of habit, (but most of all) firm beleefe of hisdeath, was the maine prevention.

　　At such time as Thorello thought it convenient, to approve how farrehe was falne out of her remembrance; he took the ring which she gavehim at his departure, and calling a young Page that waited on none butthe Bride, said to him in Italian: Faire youth, goe to the Bride,and saluting her from me, tell her, it is a custome observed in myCountry, that when any Stranger (as I am heere) sitteth before a newmarried Bride, as now shee is, in signe that hee is welcome to herfeast, she sendeth the same Cup (wherein she drinketh her selfe)full of the best wine, and when the stranger hath drunke so much ashim pleaseth, the Bride then pledgeth him with all the rest. ThePage delivered the message to the Bride, who, being a woman ofhonourable disposition, and reputing him to be a Noble Gentleman, totestifie that his presence there was very acceptable to her, sheecommanded a faire Cuppe of gold (which stood directlie before her)to bee neately washed, and when it was filled with excellent Wine,caused it to bee carried to the stranger, and so it was done.

　　Thorello having drunke a heartie draught to the Bride, conveyedthe Ring into the Cuppe, before any person could perceive it, andhaving left but small store of Wine in it, covered the Cuppe, and sentit againe to the Bride, who received it very gracioasly, and to honourthe Stranger in his Countries custome, dranke up the rest of the Wine,and espying the Ring, shee tooke it forth undescried by any: Knowingit to be the same Ring which shee gave Signior Thorello at his partingfrom her; she fixed her eyes often on it, and as often on him, whomshe thought to be a stranger, the cheerfull bloud mounting up into hercheeks, and returning againe with remembrance to her heart, that(howsoever thus disguised) he only was her husband.

　　Like one of Bacchus Froes, up furiously she started, and throwingdowne the Table before her, cried out aloud: This is my Lord andHusband, this truely is my Lord Thorello. So running to the Tablewhere he sate, without regard of all the riches thereon, down shethrew it likewise, and clasping her armes about his necke, hung somainly on him (weeping, sobbing, and kissing him) as she could notbe taken off by any of the company, nor shewed any moderation inthis excesse of passion, till Thorello spake, and entreated her tobe more patient, because this extremity was over-dangerous for her.Thus was the solemnitic much troubled, but every one there very gladand joyfull for the recovery of such a famous and worthy Knight, whointreated them all to vouchsafe him silence, and so related all hisfortunes to them, from the time of his departure, to the instanthoure. Concluding withall, that hee was no way offended with the newBridegroome, who upon the so constant report of his death, deserved noblame in making election of his wife.

　　The Bridegroome, albeit his countenance was somewhat cloudie, to seehis hope thus disappointed: yet granted freely, that Adalietto wasThorello's wife in equitie, and bee could not justly lay any claime toher. She also resigned the Crown and Rings which she had so latelyreceived of her new Spouse, and put that on her finger which she foundin the Cup, and that Crowne was set upon her head, in honor sent herfrom great Saladine. In which triumphant manner, she left the newBridegrooms abiding, and repayred home to Thorello's house, withsuch pompe and magnificence as never had the like been seene inPavia before, all the Citizens esteeming it as a miracle, that theyhad so happily recovered Signior Thorello againe.

　　Some part of the Jewells he gave to him, who had beene at costwith marriage feasting, and some to his the Abbot, beside a bountiebestowed on Monkes. Then he sent a messenger to Saladine, with Lettersof his whole successe, and confessing himselfe (for ever) hisobliged servant: living many yeeres (after) with his wife Adalietta,and using greater curtesies to strangers, then ever before he haddone.

　　In this manner ended the troubles of Signior Thorello, and theafflictions of his dearely affected Lady, with due recompence to theirhonest and ready courtesies. Many strive (in outward shew) to doethe like, who although they are sufficiently able, doe performe itso basely, as i: rather redoundeth to their shame, then honour. Andtherefore if no merit ensue thereon, but onely such disgrace as justlyshould follow; let them lay the blame upon themselves.

　　THE TENTH DAY, THE TENTH NOVELL

　　SET DOWNE AS AN EXAMPLE OR WARNING TO ALL WEALTHIE MEN,

　　HOW TO HAVE CARE OF MARRYING THEMSELVES. AND LIKEWISE TO POORE

　　AND MEANE WOMEN, TO BE PATIENT IN THEIR FORTUNES, AND

　　OBEDIENT TO THEIR HUSBANDS

　　The Marquesse of Saluzzo, named Gualtiero, being constrained bythe importunate solliciting of his Lords, and other inferiourpeople, to joyne himselfe in marriage; tooke a woman according tohis owne liking, called Grizelda, she being the daughter of a pooreCountriman, named Janiculo, by whom he had two children, which hepretended to be secretly murdered. Afterward, they being grown toyeres of more stature, and making shew of taking in marriage anotherwife, more worthy of his high degree and Calling: made a seemingpublique liking of his owne daughter, expulsing his wife Grizeldapoorely from him. But finding her incomparable patience; moredearely (then before) hee received her into favour againe, brought herhome to his owne Pallace, where (with her children) hee caused her andthem to be respectively honoured, in despight of all her adverseenemies.

　　Questionlesse, the Kings Novell not so much exceed the rest inlength, but it proved as sing to the whole assembly, past with theirgenerall approbation, till Dioneus (in a merry jesting humour) said.The plaine honest simple man, that stood holding the Candle, to seethe setting on of his Mules tayle; deserved two penny-worth of morepraise, then all our applauding of Signior Thorello: And knowinghimselfe to bee left for the last speaker, thus he began.

　　Milde and modest Ladies, for ought I can perceive to the contrary,this day was dedicated to none but Kings, Soldanes, and greatPotentates, not in favour of any inferiour or meaner persons. Andtherefore, because I would be loth to dis-ranke my selfe from therest, I purpose to speake of a Lord Marquesse, not any matter of greatmagnificence, but rather in a more humble nature, and sorted to anhonest end: which yet I will not advise any to immitate, because(perhaps) they cannot so well digest it, as they did whom my Novellconcerneth; thus then I begin.

　　It it a great while since, when among those that were LordMarquesses of Saluzzo, the very greatest and worthiest man of them al,was a young Noble Lord, named Gualtiero, who having neyther wife norchilde, spent his time in nothing else but hawking and hunting: norhad he any minde of marriage, or to enjoy the benefit of children,wherein many did repute him the wiser. But this being distastfull tohis subjects, they very often earnestly solicited him, to matchhimselfe with a wife, to the end, that hee might not decease withoutan heire, nor they be left destitute of a succeeding Lord; offeringthemselves to provide him of such a one, so well descended by Fatherand Mother, as not only should confirm their hope, but also yeeldhim high contentment; whereto the Lord Marquess thus answered.

　　Worthie friends, you would constraine me to the thing, wherewith Inever had any intent to meddle, considering, how difficult a case itis to meet with such a woman, who can agree with a man in all hisconditions, and how great the number is of them, who daily happen onthe contrarie: but most (and worst of all the rest) how wretched andmiserable prooves the life of man, who is bound to live with a wifenot fit for him. And in saying, you can learn to understand thecustome and qualities of children, by behaviour of the fathers andmothers, and so to provide mee of a wife, it is a meere argument offolly: for neither shall I comprehend, or you either, the secretinclinations of parents; I meane of the Father, and much lesse thecomplexion of the mother. But admitte it were within compasse of powerto know them; yet it is a frequent sight, and observed every day; thatdaughters doe resemble neither father nor mother, but that they arenaturally governed by their owne instinct.

　　But because you are so desirous to have me fettered in the chains ofwedlocke; I am contented to grant what you request. And because Iwould have no complaint made of any but my selfe, if matters shouldnot happen answerable to expectation; I will make mine owne eyes myelectors, and not see by any others sight. Giving you this assurancebefore, that if she whom I shall make choice of, be not of youhonoured and respected as your Lady and Mistresse: it will ensue toyour detriment, how much you have displeased me, to take a wife atyour request, and against mine owne will.

　　The Noble men answered, that they were well satisfied, provided thathe tooke a wife.

　　Some indifferent space of time before, the beauty, manners, andwell-seeming vertues, of a poore Countrie-mans daughter, dwelling inno farre distant village, had appeared very pleasing to the LordMarquesse, and gave him full perswasion, that with her hee should leada comfortable life. And therefore without any further search orinquisition, he absolutely resolved to marry her, and having conferredwith her Father, agreed, that his daughter should be his wife.Whereupon, the Marquesse made a generall convocation of all his Lords,Barons, and other of his especiall friends, from all parts of hisDominion; and when they were assembled together, hee then spake untothem in manner as followeth.Honourable friends, it appeared pleasing to you all, and yet (Ithinke) you are of the same minde, that I should dispose my selfe totake a wife: and I thereto condescended, more to yeeld youcontentment, then for any particular desire in my selfe. Let mee nowremember you of your solemne made promise, with full consent tohonor and obey her (whosoever) as your Soveraigne Lady andMistresse, that I shall elect to make my wife: and now the time iscome, for my exacting the performance of that promise, and which Ilook you must constantly keepe. I have made choyce of a yongvirgine, answerable to mine owne heart and liking, dwelling notfarre off hence, whom I intend to make my wife, and (within few dales)to have her brought home to my Pallace. Let your care and diligencethen extend so farre, as to see that the feast may be sumptuous, andher entertainment to bee most honourable: to the end that I mayreceive as much contentment in your promise performed, as you shallperceive I doe in my choice.

　　The Lords and all the rest, were wondrously joyfull to heare himso well inclined, expressing no lesse by their shouts and jocundsuffrages: protesting cordially, that she should be welcommed withpompe and majestie, and honoured of them all, as their Liege Ladie andSoveraigne. Afterward, they made preparation for a princely andmagnificent feast, as the Marquesse did the like, for a marriage ofextraordinary state and qualitie, inviting all his kinred, friends,and acquaintance in all parts and Provinces, about him. Hee madealso readie most riche and costly garments, shaped by the body of acomely young Gentlewoman, who he knew to be equall in proportion andstature, to her of whom hee hade made his election.

　　When the appointed nuptiall day was come, the Lord Marques, aboutnine of the clocke in the morning, mounted on horsebacke, as all therest did, who came to attend him honourably, and having all thingsin due readinesse with them, he said: Lords, it is time for us togoe fetch the Bride. So on hee rode with his traine, to the same pooreVillage whereat shee dwelt, and when hee was come to her Fathershouse, hee saw the maiden returning very hastily from a Well, whereshee had beene to fetch a paile of water, which shee set downe, andstood (accompanied with other maidens) to see the passage by of theLord Marquesse and his traine. Gualtiero called her by her name, whichwas Grizelda, and asked her, where her Father was: who bashfullyanswered him, and with an humble courtesie, saying. My graciousLord, hee is in the house.

　　Then the Marquesse dismounted from his horse, commanding every oneto attend him, then all alone hee entred into the poore Cottage, wherehe found the maides father, being named Janiculo, and said unto him.God speed good Father, I am come to espouse thy daughter Grizelda: butfirst I have a few demands to make, which I will utter to her in thypresence. Then hee turned to the maide, and saide.

　　Faire Grizelda, if I make you my wife, will you doe your bestendeavour to please me, in all things which I shall doe or say? willyou also be gentle, humble, and patient? with divers other the likequestions: whereto she still answered, that she would, so neere asheaven (with grace) should enable her.

　　Presently he tooke her by the hand, so led her forth of the poorehomely house, and in the presence of all his company, with his ownehands, he took off her meane wearing garments, smocke and all, andcloathed her with those Robes of State which he had purposelybrought thither for her, and plaiting her haire over her shoulders,hee placed a Crowne of gold on her head, whereat every one standing asamazed, and wondring not a little, hee said: Grizelda, wilt thouhave me to thy husband? Modestly blushing, and kneeling on the ground,she answered. Yes my gracious Lord, if you will accept so poore amaiden to be your wife. Yes Grizelda, quoth hee, with this holy kisse,I confirme thee for my wife; and so espoused her before them all. Thenmounting her on a milke-white Palfray, brought thither for her, sheewas thus honourably conducted to her Pallace.

　　Now concerning the marriage feast and triumphes, they were performedwith no lesse pompe, then if she had beene daughter to the King ofFrance. And the young Bride apparantly declared, that (with hergarments) her minde and behavior were quite changed. For indeed sheewas (as it were shame to speake otherwise) a rare creature, both ofperson and perfections, and not onely was shee absolute for beautie,but so sweetely amiand gracious, and goodlie; as if she were not thedaughter of poore Janicula, and a Countrie Shepheardesse, but ratherof some Noble Lord, whereat every one wondred that had knowne her.Beside all this, shee was so obedient to her husband, so fervent inall dutifull offices, and patient, without the very least provoking:as hee held himselfe much more then contented, and the onely happy manof the world.

　　In like manner, towards the subjects of her Lord and Husband, sheshewed her selfe alwayes so benigne and gracious; as there was not anyone, but the more they lookt on her, the better they loved her,honouring her voluntarily, and praying to the heavens, for her health,dignity and well-fares long continuance. Speaking now (quitecontrary to their former opinion of the Marquesse) honourably andthily, that he had shewne him selfe a singular wise man, in theelection of his Wife, which few else (but he) in the world wouldhave done: because their judgement might fall farre short, ofdiscerning those great and precious vertues, veiled under a homelyhabite, and obscured in a poore Countrey cottage. To be briefe, invery short time, not onely the Marquisate it selfe, but allneighbouring Provinces round about, had no other common talke, butof her rare course of life, devotion, charity, and all good actionselse; quite quailing all sinister Instructions of her Husband,before he received her in marriage.

　　About foure or five yeeres after the birth of her daughter, sheeconceived with child againe, and (at the limitted houre ofdeliverance) had a goodly Sonne, to the no little liking of theMarquesse. Afterward, a strange humour entred into his braine, namely,that by a long continued experience, and courses of intollerablequality; he would needes make proofe of his faire Wives patience.First he began to provoke her by injurious speeches, shewing fierceand frowning lookes to her, intimating; that his people grewdispleased with him, in regard of his Wives base birth andeducation, and so much the rather, because she was likely to bringchildren, who (by her blood) were no better then beggers, and murmuredat the daughter already borne. Which words when Grizelda heard,without any alteration of countenance, for the least distemperature inany appearing action she said.

　　My honourable and gracious Lord, dispose of me, as you thinkebest, for your owne dignity and contentment, for I shall therewithbe well pleased: as she that knowes her selfe, farre inferiour tothe meanest of your people, much lesse worthy of the honour, wheretoyou liked to advance me.

　　This answere was very welcome to the Marquesse, as apparantlyperceiving hereby, that the dignity whereto hee had exalted her, orany particular favours beside, could not infect her with any pride,coynesse, or disdaine. Not long after, having told her in plaine andopen speeches, that his subjects could not endure her so late bornedaughter: he called a trusty servant of his, and having instructed himwhat he should doe, sent him to Grizelda, and he being alone with her,looking very sadde, and much perplexed in mind, he saide. Madame,except I intend to loose mine owne life, I must accomplish what myLord hath strictly enjoyned me, which is, to take this your yongdaughter, and then I must: So breaking off abruptly, the Ladyhearing his words, and noting his frowning lookes, remembring alsowhat the Marquesse himselfe had formerly said; she presently imagined,that he had commanded his servant to kill the childe. Suddenlytherefore, she tooke it out of the Cradle, and having sweetlykissed, and bestowne her blessing on it (albeit her heart throbbed,with the inward affection of a Mother) without any alteration ofcountenance, she tenderly laid it in the servants armes, and said.Here friend, take it, and doe with it as thy Lord and mine hathcommanded thee: but leave it in no rude place, where birds or savagebeasts may devour it, except it be his will to have it so.

　　The servant departing from her with the child, and reporting theMarquesse what his Lady had said; he wondered at her incomparableconstancy. Then he sent it by the same servant to Bologna, to anhonourable Lady his kinsewoman, requesting her (without revealingwhose child it was) to see it both nobly and carefully educated.

　　At time convenient afterward, being with child againe, and deliveredof a Princely Sonne (then which nothing could be more joyfull to theMarquesse) yet all this was not sufficient for him; but with farreruder language then before, and lookes expressing harsh intentions, hesaid unto her. Grizelda, though thou pleasest me wonderfully, by thebirth of this Princely Boy, yet my subjects are not therewithcontented, but blunder abroad maliciously; that the grandchild ofJaniculo, a poore countrey pezant, when I am dead and gone, must betheir Soveraigne Lord and Master. Which makes me stand in feare oftheir expulsion, and to prevent that, I must be rid of this childe, aswell as the other, and then send thee away from hence, that I may takeanother wife, more pleasing to them.

　　Grizelda, with a patient sufferent soule, hearing what he hadsaid, returned no other answere but this. Most Gracious and HonourableLord, satisfie and please your owne Royall minde, and never use anyrespect of me: for nothing is precious or pleasing to mee, but whatmay agree with your good liking. Within a while after, the NobleMarquesse in the like manner as he did before for the Daughter, sohe sent the same servant for the Sonne, and seeming as if he hadsent it to have been slaine, conveighed it to be nursed at Bologna, incompany of his sweete Sister. Whereat the Lady shewed no otherdiscontentment in any kinde, then formerly she had done for herDaughter, to the no meane marvell of the Marquesse, who protested inhis soule, that the like woman was not in all the world beside. Andwere it not for his heedfull observation, how loving and carefullshe was of her children, prizing them as dearely as her owne life:rash opinion might have perswaded him, that she had no more in her,then a carnall affection, not caring how many she had, so shee mightthus easily be rid of them; but he knew her to be a truely vertuousmother, and wisely liable to endure his severest impositions.

　　His Subjects beleeving, that he had caused the children to beeslaine, blamed him greatly, thought him to be a most cruell man, anddid highly compassionate the Ladies case: who when shee came incompany of other Gentlewomen, which mourned for their deceassedchildren, would answere nothing else: but that they could not bemore pleasing to her, then they were to the father that begot them.

　　Within certaine yeares after the birth of these children, theMarquesse purposed with himselfe, to make his last and finall proofeof faire Grizeldaes patience, and said to some neere about him: thathe could no longer endure, to keepe Grizelda as his wife,confessing, he had done foolishly, and according to a young giddiebraine, when he was so rash in the marriage of her. Wherfore hewould send to the Pope, and purchase a dispensation from him, torepudiate Grizelda, and take another Wife. Wherein although theygreatly reproved him; yet he told them plainely, that it must needesbe so.

　　The Lady hearing these newes, and thinking she must returne againeto her poore father's house, and (perhaps) to her old occupation ofkeeping sheepe, as in her yonger dayes she had done, understandingwithall, that another woman must enjoy him, whom shee dearely lovedand honoured; you may well thinke (worthy Ladies) that her patiencewas now put to the maine proofe indeede. Neverthelesse, as with aninvincible true vertuous courage, she had outstood all the otherinjuries of Fortune; so did she constantly settle her soule, tobeare this with an undaunted countenance and behaviour.

　　At such time as was prefixed for the purpose, counterfeit Letterscame to the Marquesse (as sent from Rome) which he caused to bepublikely read in the hearing of his subjects: that the Pope haddispensed with him, to leave Grizelda, and marry with another Wife,wherefore sending for her immediatly, in presence of them all, thus hespake to her. Woman, by concession sent me from the Pope, he hathdispensed with me, to make choyce of another Wife, and to free myselfe from thee. And because my predecessors have beene Noblemen,and great Lords in this Country, thou being the daughter of a pooreCountrey Clowne, and their blood and mine notoriously imbased, by mymarriage with thee: I intend to have thee no longer my Wife, butwill returne thee home to thy Fathers house, with all the rich Dowrythou broughtest me; and then I wil take another Wife, with whom I amalready contracted, better beseeming my birth, and farre morecontenting and pleasing to my people.

　　The Lady hearing these words (not without much paine and difficulty)restrayned her teares, quite contrary to the naturall inclination ofwomen, and thus answered. Great Marquesse, I never was so empty ofdiscretion, but did alwayes acknowledge, that my base and humblecondition, could not in any manner sute with your high blood andNobility, and my being with you, I ever acknowledged, to proceedfrom heaven and you, not any merit of mine, but onely as a favour lentme, which you being now pleased to recall backe againe, I ought tobe pleased (and so am) that it bee restored. Here is the Ring,wherewith you Espoused me; here (in all humility) I deliver it to you.You command me, to carry home the marriage Dowry which I broughtwith me: there is no need of a Treasurer to repay it me, neither anynew purse to carry it in, much lesse any Sumpter to be laden withit. For (Noble Lord) it was never out of my memory, that you tookeme starke naked, and if it shall seeme sightly to you, that thisbody which hath borne two children, and begotten by you, must againebe seene naked; willingly must I depart hence naked. But I humblybeg of your Excellency, in recompence of my Virginity, which I broughtyou blamelesse, so much as in thought: that I may have but one of mywedding Smocks, onely to conceale the shame of nakednesse, and thenI depart rich enough.

　　The Marquesse whose heart wept bloody teares, as his eyes wouldlikewise gladly have yeelded their naturall tribute; covered allwith a dissembled angry countenance, and starting up, said. Goe,give her a Smocke onely, and so send her gadding. All there presentabout him, entreated him to let her have a petticote, because it mightnot be said, that she who had been his Wife thirteene yeares and more,was sent away so poorely in her Smocke: but all their perswasionsprevailed not with him. Naked in her Smocke, without hose or shoes,bareheaded, and not so much as a Cloth about her necke, to the greatgriefe and mourning of all that saw her, she went home to her oldfathers house.

　　And he (good man) never beleeving, that the Marquesse would longkeepe his daughter as his Wife, but rather expected dally, what nowhad happened: safely laid up the garments, whereof the Marquessedespoyled her, the same morning when he espoused her. Wherefore hedelivered them to her, and she fell to her fathers houshold businesse,according as formerly she had done; sustayning with a great andunconquerable spirit, all the cruell assaults of her enemy Fortune.

　　About such time after, as suted with his owne disposition, theMarquesse made publiquely knowne to his subjects, that he meant tojoyne in marriage again, with the daughter to one of the Counts ofPanago, and causing preparation to be made for a sumptuous wedding; hesent for Grizelda, and she being come, thus he spake to her. TheWife that I have made the new election of, is to arrive here withinvery few dayes, and at her first comming, I would have her to bemost honourably entertained. Thou knowest I have no women in my house,that can decke up the Chambers, and set all requisite things in dueorder, befitting for so solemne a Feast: and therefore I sent forthee, who knowing (better then any other) all the partes, provisionand goods in the house, set every thing in such order, as thou shaltthinke necessary.

　　Invite such Ladies and Gentlewomen as thou wilt, and give themwelcome, even as if thou wert the Lady of the house: and when themarriage is ended, returne then home to thy father againe.

　　Although these words pierced like wonding daggers, the heart ofpoore (but Noble patient) Grizelda, as being unable to forget theunequal'd love she bare to the Marquesse, though the dignitie of herformer fortune, more easily slipt out of her remembrance; yetneverthelesse, thus she answered.

　　My Gracious Lord, I am glad I can doe you any service; wherein youshall find mee both willing and ready. In the same poore garments,as she came from her fathers house, (although shee was turned out inher Smocke) she began to sweep and make cleane the Chambers, rubbe thestooles and benches in the Hall, and ordered every in the Kitchin,as if she were the worst maide in all the house, never ceasing orgiving over, till all things were in due and decent order as bestbeseemed in such a case. After all which was done, the Marquesse,having invited all the Ladies of the Countrey, to be present at sogreat a Feast: when the marriage day came, Grizelda, in her gowne ofCountrey gray, gave them welcome, in honourable manner, and gracedthem all with very cheerefull countenance.

　　Gualtiero the Marquesse, who had caused his two children to be noblynourished at Bologna, with a neere kinswoman of his, who had marriedwith one of the Counts of Panago, his daughter being now aged twelveyeares old, and somewhat more, as also the Son about sixe or seven. Hesent a Gentleman expresly to his kindred, to have them come and visitehim at Saluzza, bringing his daughter and Sonne with them, attended invery honourable manner, and publishing every where as they came along,that the young Virgin (knowne to none but himselfe and them) should bethe Wife to the Marquesse, and that onely was the cause of hercomming. The Gentleman was not slacke, in the execution of the trustreposed in him: but having made convenient preparation; with thekindred, Sonne, daughter, and a worthy company attending on them,arrived at Saluzza about dinner time, where wanted no resort, from allneighbouring parts round about, to see the comming of the LordMarquesses new Spouse.

　　By the Lords and Ladies she was joyfully entertained, and comminginto the great Hall, where the tables were readily covered:Grizelda, in her homely Country habite, humbled her selfe beforeher, saying. Gracious welcome, to the new elected Spouse of the LordMarquesse.

　　All the Ladies there present, who had very earnestly importunedGualtiero (but in vaine) that Grizelda, might better be shut up insome Chamber, or else to lend her the wearing of any other garments,which formerly had been her owne, because she should not be so poorelyseene among strangers: being seated at the Tables, she waited onthem very serviceably. The yong Virgin was observed by every one,who spared not to say; that the Marquesse had made an excellentchange: but above them all, Grizelda did most commend her, and sodid her brother likewise, as young as he was, yet not knowing her tobe his Sister.

　　Now was the Marquesse sufficiently satisfied in his soule, that hehad seene so much as he desired, concerning the patience of hisWife, who in so many hart-grieving trials, was never noated so much asto alter her countenance. And being absolutely perswaded, that thisproceeded not from any want of understanding in her, because he knewher to be singularly wise: he thought it high time now, to free herfrom these afflicting oppressions, and give her such assurance asshe ought to have. Wherefore, commanding her into his presence, openlybefore all his assembled friends, smiling on her, he said. Whatthinkst thou Grizelda of our new chosen Spouse? My Lord (quoth she)I like her exceeding well, and if she be so wise, as she is faire(which verely I thinke she is) I make no doubt but you shall live withher, as the onely happy man of the world. But I humbly entreat yourHonor (if I have any power in me to prevaile by) that you would notgive her such cutting and unkind language, as you did to your otherwife: for I cannot thinke her armed with such patience, as should(indeed) support them: as wel in regard she is much yonger, as alsoher more delicate breeding and education, whereas she who you hadbefore, was brought up in continual toile and travaile.

　　When the Marquesse perceyved, that Grizelda beleeved verily, thisyong daughter of hers should be his wife, and answered him in sohonest and modest manner: he commanded her to sit downe by him, andsaide. Grizelda, it is now more then fitte time, that thou shouldsttaste the fruite of thy long admired patience, and that they whohave thought me cruell, harsh and uncivill natured, should at lengthobserve, that I have done nothing basely, or unadvisedly. For this wasa worke premeditated before, for enstructing thee, what it is to bea married wife, and to let them know (whosoever they be) how to takeand keepe a wife. Which hath begotten (to me) perpetuall joy andhappinesse, so long as I have a day to live with thee: a matterwhereof I stoode before greatly in feare, and which (in marriage Ithought) would never happen to me.

　　It is not unknown to thee, in how many kinds (for my first proofe) Igave thee harsh and unpleasing speeches, which drawing nodiscontentment from thee, either in lookes, words, or behaviour, butrather such comfort as my soule desired, and so in my othersucceedings afterward: in one minute now, I purpose to give theethat consolation, which I bereft thee of in many tempestuousstormes, and make a sweet restauration, for all thy former sowersufferinges. My faire and dearly affected Grizelda, shee whom thousupposest for my new elected Spouse, with a glad and cheerfull hart,imbrace for thine owne daughter, and this also her Brother, beeingboth of them thy children and mine, in common opinion of the vulgarmultitude, imagined to be (by my command) long since slaine. I amthy honourable Lord and Husband, who doth, and will love thee farreabove all women else in the world; giving thee justly this deservedpraise and commendation, That no man living hath the like Wife, as Ihave.

　　So, sweetly kissing her infinitely, and hugging her joyfully inhis armes (the teares now streaming like new-let-loose Rivers, downeher faire face, which no disaster before could force from her) heebrought her, and seated her by her daughter, who was not a littleamazed at so rare an alteration. Shee having in zeale of affection)kissed and embraced them both, all else there present being clearelyresolved from the former doubt which too long deluded them; the ladiesarose jocondly from the tables, and attending on Grizelda to herChamber, in signe of a more successfull augury to follow, tooke offher poor contemptible rags, and put on such costly robes, which (asLady Marchionesse) she used to weare before.

　　Afterward, they waited on her into the Hall againe, being their trueSoveraigne Lady and Mistresse, as she was no lesse in her poorestGarments; where all rejoycing for the new restored Mother, and happyrecovery of so noble a son and daughter, the Festivall continuedmany months after. Now every one thought the Marquesse to be a nobleand wise Prince, though somewhat sharpe and unsufferable, in thesevere experiences made of his wife: but (above al) they reputedGrizelda, to be a most wise, patient, and vertuous Lady. The Countof Panago, within few daies after returned backe to Bologna; and theLord Marques, fetching home old Janiculo from his country drudgery, tolive with him (as his Father in law) in his Princely Palace, gavehim honorable maintenance, wherein hee long continued, and ended hisdaies. Afterward, he matched his daughter in a Noble marriage: heand Grizelda living a long time together, in the highest honor thatpossibly could be.

　　What can now be saide to the contrary, but that poore CountryCottages, may yeeld as divine and excellent spirits, as the moststately and Royall mansions, which breed and bring uppe some, moreworthy to be Hog-rubbers, then hold any soveraignty over men? Where isany other (beside Grizelda) who not only without a wet eye, butimboldned by a valiant and invincible courage: that can suffer thesharpe rigors, and (never the like heard of proofes) made by theMarquesse? Perhaps he might have met with another, who would havequitted him in a contrary kinde, and for thrusting her forth of dooresin her smocke, could have found better succor somewhere else, ratherthen walke so nakedly in the cold streets.

　　Dioneus having thus ended his Novel, and the Ladies delivering theirseverall judgements, according to their owne fancies, some holding oneconceite, others leaning to the contrary; one blaming this thing,and another commending that, the King lifting his eyes to heaven,and seeing the Sun began to fal low, by rising of the EveningStarre; without arising from his seat, spake as followeth. DiscreetLadies, I am perswaded you know sufficiently, that the sense andunderstanding of us mortals, consisteth not onely (as I think) bypreserving in memory things past, or knowledge of them present; butsuch as both by the one and other, know how to foresee futureoccasions, are worthily thought wise, and of no common capacity.

　　It will be (to morrow) fifteene dayes, since we departed from theCity of Florence, to come hither for our pastime and comfort, theconservation of our lives, and support of our health, by avoydingthose melanchollies, griefes and anguishes, which we beheld dayliein our City, since the pestilentiall visitation beganne there, wherein(by my judgement) we have done well and honestly. Albeit some lightNovels, perhaps attractive to a little wantonnes, as some say, and ourjoviall feasting with good cheare, singing and dancing, may seemematters inciting to incivility, especially in weake and shallowunderstandings. But I have neither seene, heard, or knowne, anyacte, word, or whatsoever else, either on your part or ours, justlydeserving to be blamed: but all has bin honest, as in a sweete andhermonious concord, such as might well beseeme the communitie ofBrethren and Sisters; which assuredly, as well in regard of you, asus, hath much contented me.

　　And therefore, least by over-long consuetude, something shouldtake life, which might be converted to a bad construction, and byour country demourance for so many dayes, some captious conceit maywrest out an ill imagination; I am of the minde (if yours be the like)seeing each of us hath had the honor, which now remaineth still on me:that it is very fitting for us, to returne thither from whence wecame. And so much the rather, because this sociable meeting of ours,which already hath wonne the knowledge of many dwellers here about us,should not grow to such an increase, as might make our purposedpastime offensive to us. In which respect (if you allow of advise) Iwil keepe the Crowne till our departing hence; the which I intendshalbe to morrow: but if you determine otherwise I am the man readyto make my resignation.

　　Many imaginations passed amongst the Ladies, and likewise the men,but yet in the end, they reputed the Kings counsell to bee the bestand wisest, concluding to do as he thought convenient. Wherupon, heecalled the Master of the housholde, and conferred with him, of thebusinesse belonging to the next morning, and then gave the companyleave to rise. The Ladies and the rest, when they were risen, fel someto one kinde of recreation, and others as their fancies served them,even as (before) they had done. And when Supper time came, theydispatcht it in very loving manner. Then they began to play oninstruments, sing and dance, and Madame Lauretta leading the dance:the King commaunded Madame Fiammetta to sing a song, whichpleasantly she began in this manner.

　　THE SONG

　　THE CHORUS SUNG BY ALL THE REST OF THE COMPANY

　　If Love were free from Jealousie,

　　No Lady living,

　　Had lesse heart-greeving,

　　Or liv'd so happily as I.

　　If gallant youth

　　In a faire friend, a woman could content,

　　If vertues prize, valour and hardiment,

　　Wit, carriage, purest eloquence,

　　Could free a woman from impatience:

　　Then I am she can vaunt (if I were wise)

　　All these in one faire flower,

　　Are in my power,

　　And yet I boast no more but trueth.

　　If Love were free from jealousie, etc.

　　But I behold

　　That other Women are as wise as

　　Which killes me quite,

　　Fearing false sirquedrie.

　　For when my fire begins to flame

　　Others desires misguide my aim,

　　And so bereaves me of secure delight.

　　Onely through fond mistrust, he is unjust:

　　Thus are my comforts hourely hot and cold.

　　If Love were free, etc.

　　If in my friend,

　　I found like faith, as manly minde I know;

　　Mistrust were slaine.

　　But my fresh griefes still grow,

　　By sight of such as do allure,

　　So I can thinke none true, none sure,

　　But all would rob me of my golden gaine.

　　Loe thus I dye, in jealousie,

　　For losse of him, on whom I most depend.

　　If Love were free, etc.

　　Let me advise

　　Such Ladies as in Love are bravely bold,

　　Not to wrong me, I scorne to be controld.

　　If any one I chance to finde,

　　By winkes, words, smiles, in crafty kinde,

　　Seeking for that, which onely mine should be:

　　Then I protest, to do my best,

　　And make them know, that they are scarsly wise.

　　If Love were free from jealousie,

　　I know no Lady living,

　　Could have lesse heart-greeving,

　　Or live so happily as I.

　　So soone as Madam Flammetta had ended her Song; Dioneus, who sate byher, smiling said. Truly Madam, you may do us a great courtesie, toexpresse your selfe more plainly to us all, least (thorow ignorance)the possession may be imposed on your selfe, and so you remaine themore offended.

　　After the Song was past, divers other were sung beside, and it nowdrawing wel-neere midnight, by the Kings command, they all went tobed. And when new day appeared, and all the world awaked out ofsleepe, the Master of the Houshold having sent away the carriages;they returned (under the conduct of their discreet King) toFlorence, where the three Gentlemen left the seven Ladies at theChurch of Santa Maria Novella, from whence they went with them atthe first. And having parted with kinde salutations, the Gentlemenwent whether themselves best pleased, and the Ladies repaired hometo their houses.

　　EUGENIE GRANDET

　　I

　　There are houses in certain provincial towns whose aspect inspiresmelancholy, akin to that called forth by sombre cloisters, drearymoorlands, or the desolation of ruins. Within these houses there is,perhaps, the silence of the cloister, the barrenness of moors, theskeleton of ruins; life and movement are so stagnant there that astranger might think them uninhabited, were it not that he encounterssuddenly the pale, cold glance of a motionless person, whose half-monastic face peers beyond the window-casing at the sound of anunaccustomed step.

　　Such elements of sadness formed the physiognomy, as it were, of adwelling-house in Saumur which stands at the end of the steep streetleading to the chateau in the upper part of the town. This street--nowlittle frequented, hot in summer, cold in winter, dark in certainsections--is remarkable for the resonance of its little pebblypavement, always clean and dry, for the narrowness of its tortuousroad-way, for the peaceful stillness of its houses, which belong tothe Old town and are over-topped by the ramparts. Houses threecenturies old are still solid, though built of wood, and their diversaspects add to the originality which commends this portion of Saumurto the attention of artists and antiquaries.

　　It is difficult to pass these houses without admiring the enormousoaken beams, their ends carved into fantastic figures, which crownwith a black bas-relief the lower floor of most of them. In one placethese transverse timbers are covered with slate and mark a bluish linealong the frail wall of a dwelling covered by a roof /en colombage/which bends beneath the weight of years, and whose rotting shinglesare twisted by the alternate action of sun and rain. In another placeblackened, worn-out window-sills, with delicate sculptures nowscarcely discernible, seem too weak to bear the brown clay pots fromwhich springs the heart's-ease or the rose-bush of some poor working-woman. Farther on are doors studded with enormous nails, where thegenius of our forefathers has traced domestic hieroglyphics, of whichthe meaning is now lost forever. Here a Protestant attested hisbelief; there a Leaguer cursed Henry IV.; elsewhere some bourgeois hascarved the insignia of his /noblesse de cloches/, symbols of his long-forgotten magisterial glory. The whole history of France is there.Next to a tottering house with roughly plastered walls, where anartisan enshrines his tools, rises the mansion of a country gentleman,on the stone arch of which above the door vestiges of armorialbearings may still be seen, battered by the many revolutions that haveshaken France since 1789. In this hilly street the ground-floors ofthe merchants are neither shops nor warehouses; lovers of the MiddleAges will here find the /ouvrouere/ of our forefathers in all itsnaive simplicity. These low rooms, which have no shop-frontage, noshow-windows, in fact no glass at all, are deep and dark and withoutinterior or exterior decoration. Their doors open in two parts, eachroughly iron-bound; the upper half is fastened back within the room,the lower half, fitted with a spring-bell, swings continually to andfro. Air and light reach the damp den within, either through the upperhalf of the door, or through an open space between the ceiling and alow front wall, breast-high, which is closed by solid shutters thatare taken down every morning, put up every evening, and held in placeby heavy iron bars.

　　This wall serves as a counter for the merchandise. No delusive displayis there; only samples of the business, whatever it may chance to be,--such, for instance, as three or four tubs full of codfish and salt,a few bundles of sail-cloth, cordage, copper wire hanging from thejoists above, iron hoops for casks ranged along the wall, or a fewpieces of cloth upon the shelves. Enter. A neat girl, glowing withyouth, wearing a white kerchief, her arms red and bare, drops herknitting and calls her father or her mother, one of whom comes forwardand sells you what you want, phlegmatically, civilly, or arrogantly,according to his or her individual character, whether it be a matterof two sous' or twenty thousand francs' worth of merchandise. You maysee a cooper, for instance, sitting in his doorway and twirling histhumbs as he talks with a neighbor. To all appearance he owns nothingmore than a few miserable boat-ribs and two or three bundles of laths;but below in the port his teeming wood-yard supplies all the cooperagetrade of Anjou. He knows to a plank how many casks are needed if thevintage is good. A hot season makes him rich, a rainy season ruinshim; in a single morning puncheons worth eleven francs have been knownto drop to six. In this country, as in Touraine, atmosphericvicissitudes control commercial life. Wine-growers, proprietors, wood-merchants, coopers, inn-keepers, mariners, all keep watch of the sun.They tremble when they go to bed lest they should hear in the morningof a frost in the night; they dread rain, wind, drought, and wantwater, heat, and clouds to suit their fancy. A perpetual duel goes onbetween the heavens and their terrestrial interests. The barometersmooths, saddens, or makes merry their countenances, turn and turnabout. From end to end of this street, formerly the Grand'Rue deSaumur, the words: "Here's golden weather," are passed from door todoor; or each man calls to his neighbor: "It rains louis," knowingwell what a sunbeam or the opportune rainfall is bringing him.On Saturdays after midday, in the fine season, not one sou's worth ofmerchandise can be bought from these worthy traders. Each has hisvineyard, his enclosure of fields, and all spend two days in thecountry. This being foreseen, and purchases, sales, and profitsprovided for, the merchants have ten or twelve hours to spend inparties of pleasure, in making observations, in criticisms, and incontinual spying. A housewife cannot buy a partridge without theneighbors asking the husband if it were cooked to a turn. A young girlnever puts her head near a window that she is not seen by idlinggroups in the street. Consciences are held in the light; and thehouses, dark, silent, impenetrable as they seem, hide no mysteries.Life is almost wholly in the open air; every household sits at its ownthreshold, breakfasts, dines, and quarrels there. No one can passalong the street without being examined; in fact formerly, when astranger entered a provincial town he was bantered and made game offrom door to door. From this came many good stories, and the nickname/copieux/, which was applied to the inhabitants of Angers, whoexcelled in such urban sarcasms.

　　The ancient mansions of the old town of Saumur are at the top of thishilly street, and were formerly occupied by the nobility of theneighborhood. The melancholy dwelling where the events of thefollowing history took place is one of these mansions,--venerablerelics of a century in which men and things bore the characteristicsof simplicity which French manners and customs are losing day by day.Follow the windings of the picturesque thoroughfare, whoseirregularities awaken recollections that plunge the mind mechanicallyinto reverie, and you will see a somewhat dark recess, in the centreof which is hidden the door of the house of Monsieur Grandet. It isimpossible to understand the force of this provincial expression--thehouse of Monsieur Grandet--without giving the biography of MonsieurGrandet himself.

　　Monsieur Grandet enjoyed a reputation in Saumur whose causes andeffects can never be fully understood by those who have not, at onetime or another, lived in the provinces. In 1789 Monsieur Grandet--still called by certain persons le Pere Grandet, though the number ofsuch old persons has perceptibly diminished--was a master-cooper, ableto read, write, and cipher. At the period when the French Republicoffered for sale the church property in the arrondissement of Saumur,the cooper, then forty years of age, had just married the daughter ofa rich wood-merchant. Supplied with the ready money of his own fortuneand his wife's /dot/, in all about two thousand louis-d'or, Grandetwent to the newly established "district," where, with the help of twohundred double louis given by his father-in-law to the surlyrepublican who presided over the sales of the national domain, heobtained for a song, legally if not legitimately, one of the finestvineyards in the arrondissement, an old abbey, and several farms. Theinhabitants of Saumur were so little revolutionary that they thoughtPere Grandet a bold man, a republican, and a patriot with a mind opento all the new ideas; though in point of fact it was open only tovineyards. He was appointed a member of the administration of Saumur,and his pacific influence made itself felt politically andcommercially. Politically, he protected the ci-devant nobles, andprevented, to the extent of his power, the sale of the lands andproperty of the /emigres/; commercially, he furnished the Republicanarmies with two or three thousand puncheons of white wine, and tookhis pay in splendid fields belonging to a community of women whoselands had been reserved for the last lot.

　　Under the Consulate Grandet became mayor, governed wisely, andharvested still better pickings. Under the Empire he was calledMonsieur Grandet. Napoleon, however, did not like republicans, andsuperseded Monsieur Grandet (who was supposed to have worn thePhrygian cap) by a man of his own surroundings, a future baron of theEmpire. Monsieur Grandet quitted office without regret. He hadconstructed in the interests of the town certain fine roads which ledto his own property; his house and lands, very advantageouslyassessed, paid moderate taxes; and since the registration of hisvarious estates, the vineyards, thanks to his constant care, hadbecome the "head of the country,"--a local term used to denote thosethat produced the finest quality of wine. He might have asked for thecross of the Legion of honor.

　　This event occurred in 1806. Monsieur Grandet was then fifty-sevenyears of age, his wife thirty-six, and an only daughter, the fruit oftheir legitimate love, was ten years old. Monsieur Grandet, whomProvidence no doubt desired to compensate for the loss of hismunicipal honors, inherited three fortunes in the course of this year,--that of Madame de la Gaudiniere, born de la Bertelliere, the motherof Madame Grandet; that of old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, hergrandfather; and, lastly, that of Madame Gentillet, her grandmother onthe mother's side: three inheritances, whose amount was not known toany one. The avarice of the deceased persons was so keen that for along time they had hoarded their money for the pleasure of secretlylooking at it. Old Monsieur de la Bertelliere called an investment anextravagance, and thought he got better interest from the sight of hisgold than from the profits of usury. The inhabitants of Saumurconsequently estimated his savings according to "the revenues of thesun's wealth," as they said.

　　Monsieur Grandet thus obtained that modern title of nobility which ourmania for equality can never rub out. He became the most imposingpersonage in the arrondissement. He worked a hundred acres ofvineyard, which in fruitful years yielded seven or eight hundredhogsheads of wine. He owned thirteen farms, an old abbey, whosewindows and arches he had walled up for the sake of economy,--ameasure which preserved them,--also a hundred and twenty-seven acresof meadow-land, where three thousand poplars, planted in 1793, grewand flourished; and finally, the house in which he lived. Such was hisvisible estate; as to his other property, only two persons could giveeven a vague guess at its value: one was Monsieur Cruchot, a notaryemployed in the usurious investments of Monsieur Grandet; the otherwas Monsieur des Grassins, the richest banker in Saumur, in whoseprofits Grandet had a certain covenanted and secret share.Although old Cruchot and Monsieur des Grassins were both gifted withthe deep discretion which wealth and trust beget in the provinces,they publicly testified so much respect to Monsieur Grandet thatobservers estimated the amount of his property by the obsequiousattention which they bestowed upon him. In all Saumur there was no onenot persuaded that Monsieur Grandet had a private treasure, somehiding-place full of louis, where he nightly took ineffable delight ingazing upon great masses of gold. Avaricious people gathered proof ofthis when they looked at the eyes of the good man, to which the yellowmetal seemed to have conveyed its tints. The glance of a manaccustomed to draw enormous interest from his capital acquires, likethat of the libertine, the gambler, or the sycophant, certainindefinable habits,--furtive, eager, mysterious movements, which neverescape the notice of his co-religionists. This secret language is in acertain way the freemasonry of the passions. Monsieur Grandet inspiredthe respectful esteem due to one who owed no man anything, who,skilful cooper and experienced wine-grower that he was, guessed withthe precision of an astronomer whether he ought to manufacture athousand puncheons for his vintage, or only five hundred, who neverfailed in any speculation, and always had casks for sale when caskswere worth more than the commodity that filled them, who could storehis whole vintage in his cellars and bide his time to put thepuncheons on the market at two hundred francs, when the littleproprietors had been forced to sell theirs for five louis. His famousvintage of 1811, judiciously stored and slowly disposed of, broughthim in more than two hundred and forty thousand francs.

　　Financially speaking, Monsieur Grandet was something between a tigerand a boa-constrictor. He could crouch and lie low, watch his prey along while, spring upon it, open his jaws, swallow a mass of louis,and then rest tranquilly like a snake in process of digestion,impassible, methodical, and cold. No one saw him pass without afeeling of admiration mingled with respect and fear; had not every manin Saumur felt the rending of those polished steel claws? For thisone, Maitre Cruchot had procured the money required for the purchaseof a domain, but at eleven per cent. For that one, Monsieur desGrassins discounted bills of exchange, but at a frightful deduction ofinterest. Few days ever passed that Monsieur Grandet's name was notmentioned either in the markets or in social conversations at theevening gatherings. To some the fortune of the old wine-grower was anobject of patriotic pride. More than one merchant, more than oneinnkeeper, said to strangers with a certain complacency: "Monsieur, wehave two or three millionaire establishments; but as for MonsieurGrandet, he does not himself know how much he is worth."

　　In 1816 the best reckoners in Saumur estimated the landed property ofthe worthy man at nearly four millions; but as, on an average, he hadmade yearly, from 1793 to 1817, a hundred thousand francs out of thatproperty, it was fair to presume that he possessed in actual money asum nearly equal to the value of his estate. So that when, after agame of boston or an evening discussion on the matter of vines, thetalk fell upon Monsieur Grandet, knowing people said: "Le PereGrandet? le Pere Grandet must have at least five or six millions.""You are cleverer than I am; I have never been able to find out theamount," answered Monsieur Cruchot or Monsieur des Grassins, wheneither chanced to overhear the remark.

　　If some Parisian mentioned Rothschild or Monsieur Lafitte, the peopleof Saumur asked if he were as rich as Monsieur Grandet. When theParisian, with a smile, tossed them a disdainful affirmative, theylooked at each other and shook their heads with an incredulous air. Solarge a fortune covered with a golden mantle all the actions of thisman. If in early days some peculiarities of his life gave occasion forlaughter or ridicule, laughter and ridicule had long since died away.His least important actions had the authority of results repeatedlyshown. His speech, his clothing, his gestures, the blinking of hiseyes, were law to the country-side, where every one, after studyinghim as a naturalist studies the result of instinct in the loweranimals, had come to understand the deep mute wisdom of his slightestactions.

　　"It will be a hard winter," said one; "Pere Grandet has put on his furgloves."

　　"Pere Grandet is buying quantities of staves; there will be plenty ofwine this year."

　　Monsieur Grandet never bought either bread or meat. His farmerssupplied him weekly with a sufficiency of capons, chickens, eggs,butter, and his tithe of wheat. He owned a mill; and the tenant wasbound, over and above his rent, to take a certain quantity of grainand return him the flour and bran. La Grande Nanon, his only servant,though she was no longer young, baked the bread of the householdherself every Saturday. Monsieur Grandet arranged with kitchen-gardeners who were his tenants to supply him with vegetables. As tofruits, he gathered such quantities that he sold the greater part inthe market. His fire-wood was cut from his own hedgerows or taken fromthe half-rotten old sheds which he built at the corners of his fields,and whose planks the farmers carted into town for him, all cut up, andobligingly stacked in his wood-house, receiving in return his thanks.His only known expenditures were for the consecrated bread, theclothing of his wife and daughter, the hire of their chairs in church,the wages of la Grand Nanon, the tinning of the saucepans, lights,taxes, repairs on his buildings, and the costs of his variousindustries. He had six hundred acres of woodland, lately purchased,which he induced a neighbor's keeper to watch, under the promise of anindemnity. After the acquisition of this property he ate game for thefirst time.

　　Monsieur Grandet's manners were very simple. He spoke little. Heusually expressed his meaning by short sententious phrases uttered ina soft voice. After the Revolution, the epoch at which he first cameinto notice, the good man stuttered in a wearisome way as soon as hewas required to speak at length or to maintain an argument. Thisstammering, the incoherence of his language, the flux of words inwhich he drowned his thought, his apparent lack of logic, attributedto defects of education, were in reality assumed, and will besufficiently explained by certain events in the following history.Four sentences, precise as algebraic formulas, sufficed him usually tograsp and solve all difficulties of life and commerce: "I don't know;I cannot; I will not; I will see about it." He never said yes, or no,and never committed himself to writing. If people talked to him helistened coldly, holding his chin in his right hand and resting hisright elbow in the back of his left hand, forming in his own mindopinions on all matters, from which he never receded. He reflectedlong before making any business agreement. When his opponent, aftercareful conversation, avowed the secret of his own purposes, confidentthat he had secured his listener's assent, Grandet answered: "I candecide nothing without consulting my wife." His wife, whom he hadreduced to a state of helpless slavery, was a useful screen to him inbusiness. He went nowhere among friends; he neither gave nor accepteddinners; he made no stir or noise, seeming to economize in everything,even movement. He never disturbed or disarranged the things of otherpeople, out of respect for the rights of property. Nevertheless, inspite of his soft voice, in spite of his circumspect bearing, thelanguage and habits of a coarse nature came to the surface, especiallyin his own home, where he controlled himself less than elsewhere.Physically, Grandet was a man five feet high, thick-set, square-built,with calves twelve inches in circumference, knotted knee-joints, andbroad shoulders; his face was round, tanned, and pitted by the small-pox; his chin was straight, his lips had no curves, his teeth werewhite; his eyes had that calm, devouring expression which peopleattribute to the basilisk; his forehead, full of transverse wrinkles,was not without certain significant protuberances; his yellow-grayishhair was said to be silver and gold by certain young people who didnot realize the impropriety of making a jest about Monsieur Grandet.His nose, thick at the end, bore a veined wen, which the common peoplesaid, not without reason, was full of malice. The whole countenanceshowed a dangerous cunning, an integrity without warmth, the egotismof a man long used to concentrate every feeling upon the enjoyments ofavarice and upon the only human being who was anything whatever tohim,--his daughter and sole heiress, Eugenie. Attitude, manners,bearing, everything about him, in short, testified to that belief inhimself which the habit of succeeding in all enterprises never failsto give to a man.

　　Thus, though his manners were unctuous and soft outwardly, MonsieurGrandet's nature was of iron. His dress never varied; and those whosaw him to-day saw him such as he had been since 1791. His stout shoeswere tied with leathern thongs; he wore, in all weathers, thickwoollen stockings, short breeches of coarse maroon cloth with silverbuckles, a velvet waistcoat, in alternate stripes of yellow and puce,buttoned squarely, a large maroon coat with wide flaps, a blackcravat, and a quaker's hat. His gloves, thick as those of a gendarme,lasted him twenty months; to preserve them, he always laid themmethodically on the brim of his hat in one particular spot. Saumurknew nothing further about this personage.

　　Only six individuals had a right of entrance to Monsieur Grandet'shouse. The most important of the first three was a nephew of MonsieurCruchot. Since his appointment as president of the Civil courts ofSaumur this young man had added the name of Bonfons to that ofCruchot. He now signed himself C. de Bonfons. Any litigant so ill-advised as to call him Monsieur Cruchot would soon be made to feel hisfolly in court. The magistrate protected those who called him Monsieurle president, but he favored with gracious smiles those who addressedhim as Monsieur de Bonfons. Monsieur le president was thirty-threeyears old, and possessed the estate of Bonfons (Boni Fontis), worthseven thousand francs a year; he expected to inherit the property ofhis uncle the notary and that of another uncle, the Abbe Cruchot, adignitary of the chapter of Saint-Martin de Tours, both of whom werethought to be very rich. These three Cruchots, backed by a goodlynumber of cousins, and allied to twenty families in the town, formed aparty, like the Medici in Florence; like the Medici, the Cruchots hadtheir Pazzi.

　　Madame des Grassins, mother of a son twenty-three years of age, cameassiduously to play cards with Madame Grandet, hoping to marry herdear Adolphe to Mademoiselle Eugenie. Monsieur des Grassins, thebanker, vigorously promoted the schemes of his wife by means of secretservices constantly rendered to the old miser, and always arrived intime upon the field of battle. The three des Grassins likewise hadtheir adherents, their cousins, their faithful allies. On the Cruchotside the abbe, the Talleyrand of the family, well backed-up by hisbrother the notary, sharply contested every inch of ground with hisfemale adversary, and tried to obtain the rich heiress for his nephewthe president.

　　This secret warfare between the Cruchots and des Grassins, the prizethereof being the hand in marriage of Eugenie Grandet, kept thevarious social circles of Saumur in violent agitation. WouldMademoiselle Grandet marry Monsieur le president or Monsieur Adolphedes Grassins? To this problem some replied that Monsieur Grandet wouldnever give his daughter to the one or to the other. The old cooper,eaten up with ambition, was looking, they said, for a peer of France,to whom an income of three hundred thousand francs would make all thepast, present, and future casks of the Grandets acceptable. Othersreplied that Monsieur and Madame des Grassins were nobles, andexceedingly rich; that Adolphe was a personable young fellow; and thatunless the old man had a nephew of the pope at his beck and call, sucha suitable alliance ought to satisfy a man who came from nothing,--aman whom Saumur remembered with an adze in his hand, and who had,moreover, worn the /bonnet rouge/. Certain wise heads called attentionto the fact that Monsieur Cruchot de Bonfons had the right of entry tothe house at all times, whereas his rival was received only onSundays. Others, however, maintained that Madame des Grassins was moreintimate with the women of the house of Grandet than the Cruchotswere, and could put into their minds certain ideas which would lead,sooner or later, to success. To this the former retorted that the AbbeCruchot was the most insinuating man in the world: pit a woman againsta monk, and the struggle was even. "It is diamond cut diamond," said aSaumur wit.

　　The oldest inhabitants, wiser than their fellows, declared that theGrandets knew better than to let the property go out of the family,and that Mademoiselle Eugenie Grandet of Saumur would be married tothe son of Monsieur Grandet of Paris, a wealthy wholesale wine-merchant. To this the Cruchotines and the Grassinists replied: "In thefirst place, the two brothers have seen each other only twice inthirty years; and next, Monsieur Grandet of Paris has ambitiousdesigns for his son. He is mayor of an arrondissement, a deputy,colonel of the National Guard, judge in the commercial courts; hedisowns the Grandets of Saumur, and means to ally himself with someducal family,--ducal under favor of Napoleon." In short, was thereanything not said of an heiress who was talked of through acircumference of fifty miles, and even in the public conveyances fromAngers to Blois, inclusively!

　　At the beginning of 1811, the Cruchotines won a signal advantage overthe Grassinists. The estate of Froidfond, remarkable for its park, itsmansion, its farms, streams, ponds, forests, and worth about threemillions, was put up for sale by the young Marquis de Froidfond, whowas obliged to liquidate his possessions. Maitre Cruchot, thepresident, and the abbe, aided by their adherents, were able toprevent the sale of the estate in little lots. The notary concluded abargain with the young man for the whole property, payable in gold,persuading him that suits without number would have to be broughtagainst the purchasers of small lots before he could get the money forthem; it was better, therefore, to sell the whole to Monsieur Grandet,who was solvent and able to pay for the estate in ready money. Thefine marquisate of Froidfond was accordingly conveyed down the gulletof Monsieur Grandet, who, to the great astonishment of Saumur, paidfor it, under proper discount, with the usual formalities.This affair echoed from Nantes to Orleans. Monsieur Grandet tookadvantage of a cart returning by way of Froidfond to go and see hischateau. Having cast a master's eye over the whole property, hereturned to Saumur, satisfied that he had invested his money at fiveper cent, and seized by the stupendous thought of extending andincreasing the marquisate of Froidfond by concentrating all hisproperty there. Then, to fill up his coffers, now nearly empty, heresolved to thin out his woods and his forests, and to sell off thepoplars in the meadows.

　　II

　　It is now easy to understand the full meaning of the term, "the houseof Monsieur Grandet,"--that cold, silent, pallid dwelling, standingabove the town and sheltered by the ruins of the ramparts. The twopillars and the arch, which made the porte-cochere on which the dooropened, were built, like the house itself, of tufa,--a white stonepeculiar to the shores of the Loire, and so soft that it lasts hardlymore than two centuries. Numberless irregular holes, capriciouslybored or eaten out by the inclemency of the weather, gave anappearance of the vermiculated stonework of French architecture to thearch and the side walls of this entrance, which bore some resemblanceto the gateway of a jail. Above the arch was a long bas-relief, inhard stone, representing the four seasons, the faces already crumblingaway and blackened. This bas-relief was surmounted by a projectingplinth, upon which a variety of chance growths had sprung up,--yellowpellitory, bindweed, convolvuli, nettles, plantain, and even a littlecherry-tree, already grown to some height.

　　The door of the archway was made of solid oak, brown, shrunken, andsplit in many places; though frail in appearance, it was firmly heldin place by a system of iron bolts arranged in symmetrical patterns. Asmall square grating, with close bars red with rust, filled up themiddle panel and made, as it were, a motive for the knocker, fastenedto it by a ring, which struck upon the grinning head of a huge nail.This knocker, of the oblong shape and kind which our ancestors called/jaquemart/, looked like a huge note of exclamation; an antiquary whoexamined it attentively might have found indications of the figure,essentially burlesque, which it once represented, and which long usagehad now effaced. Through this little grating--intended in olden timesfor the recognition of friends in times of civil war--inquisitivepersons could perceive, at the farther end of the dark and slimyvault, a few broken steps which led to a garden, picturesquely shut inby walls that were thick and damp, and through which oozed a moisturethat nourished tufts of sickly herbage. These walls were the ruins ofthe ramparts, under which ranged the gardens of several neighboringhouses.

　　The most important room on the ground-floor of the house was a largehall, entered directly from beneath the vault of the porte-cochere.Few people know the importance of a hall in the little towns of Anjou,Touraine, and Berry. The hall is at one and the same time antechamber,salon, office, boudoir, and dining-room; it is the theatre of domesticlife, the common living-room. There the barber of the neighborhoodcame, twice a year, to cut Monsieur Grandet's hair; there the farmers,the cure, the under-prefect, and the miller's boy came on business.This room, with two windows looking on the street, was entirely ofwood. Gray panels with ancient mouldings covered the walls from top tobottom; the ceiling showed all its beams, which were likewise paintedgray, while the space between them had been washed over in white, nowyellow with age. An old brass clock, inlaid with arabesques, adornedthe mantel of the ill-cut white stone chimney-piece, above which was agreenish mirror, whose edges, bevelled to show the thickness of theglass, reflected a thread of light the whole length of a gothic framein damascened steel-work. The two copper-gilt candelabra whichdecorated the corners of the chimney-piece served a double purpose: bytaking off the side-branches, each of which held a socket, the mainstem--which was fastened to a pedestal of bluish marble tipped withcopper--made a candlestick for one candle, which was sufficient forordinary occasions. The chairs, antique in shape, were covered withtapestry representing the fables of La Fontaine; it was necessary,however, to know that writer well to guess at the subjects, for thefaded colors and the figures, blurred by much darning, were difficultto distinguish.

　　At the four corners of the hall were closets, or rather buffets,surmounted by dirty shelves. An old card-table in marquetry, of whichthe upper part was a chess-board, stood in the space between the twowindows. Above this table was an oval barometer with a black borderenlivened with gilt bands, on which the flies had so licentiouslydisported themselves that the gilding had become problematical. On thepanel opposite to the chimney-piece were two portraits in pastel,supposed to represent the grandfather of Madame Grandet, old Monsieurde la Bertelliere, as a lieutenant in the French guard, and thedeceased Madame Gentillet in the guise of a shepherdess. The windowswere draped with curtains of red /gros de Tours/ held back by silkencords with ecclesiastical tassels. This luxurious decoration, littlein keeping with the habits of Monsieur Grandet, had been, togetherwith the steel pier-glass, the tapestries, and the buffets, which wereof rose-wood, included in the purchase of the house.

　　By the window nearest to the door stood a straw chair, whose legs wereraised on castors to lift its occupant, Madame Grandet, to a heightfrom which she could see the passers-by. A work-table of stainedcherry-wood filled up the embrasure, and the little armchair ofEugenie Grandet stood beside it. In this spot the lives had flowedpeacefully onward for fifteen years, in a round of constant work fromthe month of April to the month of November. On the first day of thelatter month they took their winter station by the chimney. Not untilthat day did Grandet permit a fire to be lighted; and on the thirty-first of March it was extinguished, without regard either to thechills of the early spring or to those of a wintry autumn. A foot-warmer, filled with embers from the kitchen fire, which la GrandeNanon contrived to save for them, enabled Madame and MademoiselleGrandet to bear the chilly mornings and evenings of April and October.Mother and daughter took charge of the family linen, and spent theirdays so conscientiously upon a labor properly that of working-women,that if Eugenie wished to embroider a collar for her mother she wasforced to take the time from sleep, and deceive her father to obtainthe necessary light. For a long time the miser had given out thetallow candle to his daughter and la Grande Nanon just as he gave outevery morning the bread and other necessaries for the dailyconsumption.

　　La Grande Nanon was perhaps the only human being capable of acceptingwillingly the despotism of her master. The whole town envied Monsieurand Madame Grandet the possession of her. La Grande Nanon, so calledon account of her height, which was five feet eight inches, had livedwith Monsieur Grandet for thirty-five years. Though she received onlysixty francs a year in wages, she was supposed to be one of therichest serving-women in Saumur. Those sixty francs, accumulatingthrough thirty-five years, had recently enabled her to invest fourthousand francs in an annuity with Maitre Cruchot. This result of herlong and persistent economy seemed gigantic. Every servant in thetown, seeing that the poor sexagenarian was sure of bread for her oldage, was jealous of her, and never thought of the hard slavery throughwhich it had been won.

　　At twenty-two years of age the poor girl had been unable to find asituation, so repulsive was her face to almost every one. Yet thefeeling was certainly unjust: the face would have been much admired onthe shoulders of a grenadier of the guard; but all things, so theysay, should be in keeping. Forced to leave a farm where she kept thecows, because the dwelling-house was burned down, she came to Saumurto find a place, full of the robust courage that shrinks from nolabor. Le Pere Grandet was at that time thinking of marriage and aboutto set up his household. He espied the girl, rejected as she was fromdoor to door. A good judge of corporeal strength in his trade as acooper, he guessed the work that might be got out of a female creatureshaped like a Hercules, as firm on her feet as an oak sixty years oldon its roots, strong in the hips, square in the back, with the handsof a cartman and an honesty as sound as her unblemished virtue.Neither the warts which adorned her martial visage, nor the red-bricktints of her skin, nor the sinewy arms, nor the ragged garments of laGrande Nanon, dismayed the cooper, who was at that time still of anage when the heart shudders. He fed, shod, and clothed the poor girl,gave her wages, and put her to work without treating her too roughly.Seeing herself thus welcomed, la Grande Nanon wept secretly tears ofjoy, and attached herself in all sincerity to her master, who fromthat day ruled her and worked her with feudal authority. Nanon dideverything. She cooked, she made the lye, she washed the linen in theLoire and brought it home on her shoulders; she got up early, she wentto bed late; she prepared the food of the vine-dressers during theharvest, kept watch upon the market-people, protected the property ofher master like a faithful dog, and even, full of blind confidence,obeyed without a murmur his most absurd exactions.

　　In the famous year of 1811, when the grapes were gathered withunheard-of difficulty, Grandet resolved to give Nanon his old watch,--the first present he had made her during twenty years of service.Though he turned over to her his old shoes (which fitted her), it isimpossible to consider that quarterly benefit as a gift, for the shoeswere always thoroughly worn-out. Necessity had made the poor girl soniggardly that Grandet had grown to love her as we love a dog, andNanon had let him fasten a spiked collar round her throat, whosespikes no longer pricked her. If Grandet cut the bread with rather toomuch parsimony, she made no complaint; she gaily shared the hygienicbenefits derived from the severe regime of the household, in which noone was ever ill. Nanon was, in fact, one of the family; she laughedwhen Grandet laughed, felt gloomy or chilly, warmed herself, andtoiled as he did. What pleasant compensations there were in suchequality! Never did the master have occasion to find fault with theservant for pilfering the grapes, nor for the plums and nectarineseaten under the trees. "Come, fall-to, Nanon!" he would say in yearswhen the branches bent under the fruit and the farmers were obliged togive it to the pigs.

　　To the poor peasant who in her youth had earned nothing but harshtreatment, to the pauper girl picked up by charity, Grandet'sambiguous laugh was like a sunbeam. Moreover, Nanon's simple heart andnarrow head could hold only one feeling and one idea. For thirty-fiveyears she had never ceased to see herself standing before the wood-yard of Monsieur Grandet, ragged and barefooted, and to hear him say:"What do you want, young one?" Her gratitude was ever new. SometimesGrandet, reflecting that the poor creature had never heard aflattering word, that she was ignorant of all the tender sentimentsinspired by women, that she might some day appear before the throne ofGod even more chaste than the Virgin Mary herself,--Grandet, struckwith pity, would say as he looked at her, "Poor Nanon!" Theexclamation was always followed by an undefinable look cast upon himin return by the old servant. The words, uttered from time to time,formed a chain of friendship that nothing ever parted, and to whicheach exclamation added a link. Such compassion arising in the heart ofthe miser, and accepted gratefully by the old spinster, had somethinginconceivably horrible about it. This cruel pity, recalling, as itdid, a thousand pleasures to the heart of the old cooper, was forNanon the sum total of happiness. Who does not likewise say, "PoorNanon!" God will recognize his angels by the inflexions of theirvoices and by their secret sighs.

　　There were very many households in Saumur where the servants werebetter treated, but where the masters received far less satisfactionin return. Thus it was often said: "What have the Grandets ever doneto make their Grande Nanon so attached to them? She would go throughfire and water for their sake!" Her kitchen, whose barred windowslooked into the court, was always clean, neat, cold,--a true miser'skitchen, where nothing went to waste. When Nanon had washed herdishes, locked up the remains of the dinner, and put out her fire, sheleft the kitchen, which was separated by a passage from the living-room, and went to spin hemp beside her masters. One tallow candlesufficed the family for the evening. The servant slept at the end ofthe passage in a species of closet lighted only by a fan-light. Herrobust health enabled her to live in this hole with impunity; thereshe could hear the slightest noise through the deep silence whichreigned night and day in that dreary house. Like a watch-dog, sheslept with one ear open, and took her rest with a mind alert.A description of the other parts of the dwelling will be foundconnected with the events of this history, though the foregoing sketchof the hall, where the whole luxury of the household appears, mayenable the reader to surmise the nakedness of the upper floors.In 1819, at the beginning of an evening in the middle of November, laGrande Nanon lighted the fire for the first time. The autumn had beenvery fine. This particular day was a fete-day well known to theCruchotines and the Grassinists. The six antagonists, armed at allpoints, were making ready to meet at the Grandets and surpass eachother in testimonials of friendship. That morning all Saumur had seenMadame and Mademoiselle Grandet, accompanied by Nanon, on their way tohear Mass at the parish church, and every one remembered that the daywas the anniversary of Mademoiselle Eugenie's birth. Calculating thehour at which the family dinner would be over, Maitre Cruchot, theAbbe Cruchot, and Monsieur C. de Bonfons hastened to arrive before thedes Grassins, and be the first to pay their compliments toMademoiselle Eugenie. All three brought enormous bouquets, gathered intheir little green-houses. The stalks of the flowers which thepresident intended to present were ingeniously wound round with awhite satin ribbon adorned with gold fringe. In the morning MonsieurGrandet, following his usual custom on the days that commemorated thebirth and the fete of Eugenie, went to her bedside and solemnlypresented her with his paternal gift,--which for the last thirteenyears had consisted regularly of a curious gold-piece. Madame Grandetgave her daughter a winter dress or a summer dress, as the case mightbe. These two dresses and the gold-pieces, of which she received twoothers on New Year's day and on her father's fete-day, gave Eugenie alittle revenue of a hundred crowns or thereabouts, which Grandet lovedto see her amass. Was it not putting his money from one strong-box toanother, and, as it were, training the parsimony of his heiress? fromwhom he sometimes demanded an account of her treasure (formerlyincreased by the gifts of the Bertellieres), saying: "It is to be yourmarriage dozen."

　　The "marriage dozen" is an old custom sacredly preserved and still inforce in many parts of central France. In Berry and in Anjou, when ayoung girl marries, her family, or that of the husband, must give hera purse, in which they place, according to their means, twelve pieces,or twelve dozen pieces, or twelve hundred pieces of gold. The poorestshepherd-girl never marries without her dozen, be it only a dozencoppers. They still tell in Issoudun of a certain "dozen" presented toa rich heiress, which contained a hundred and forty-four /portugaisesd'or/. Pope Clement VII., uncle of Catherine de' Medici, gave her whenhe married her to Henri II. a dozen antique gold medals of pricelessvalue.

　　During dinner the father, delighted to see his Eugenie looking well ina new gown, exclaimed: "As it is Eugenie's birthday let us have afire; it will be a good omen."

　　"Mademoiselle will be married this year, that's certain," said laGrande Nanon, carrying away the remains of the goose,--the pheasant oftradesmen.

　　"I don't see any one suitable for her in Saumur," said Madame Grandet,glancing at her husband with a timid look which, considering heryears, revealed the conjugal slavery under which the poor womanlanguished.

　　Grandet looked at his daughter and exclaimed gaily,--

　　"She is twenty-three years old to-day, the child; we must soon beginto think of it."

　　Eugenie and her mother silently exchanged a glance of intelligence.Madame Grandet was a dry, thin woman, as yellow as a quince, awkward,slow, one of those women who are born to be down-trodden. She had bigbones, a big nose, a big forehead, big eyes, and presented at firstsight a vague resemblance to those mealy fruits that have neithersavor nor succulence. Her teeth were black and few in number, hermouth was wrinkled, her chin long and pointed. She was an excellentwoman, a true la Bertelliere. L'abbe Cruchot found occasionalopportunity to tell her that she had not done ill; and she believedhim. Angelic sweetness, the resignation of an insect tortured bychildren, a rare piety, a good heart, an unalterable equanimity ofsoul, made her universally pitied and respected. Her husband nevergave her more than six francs at a time for her personal expenses.Ridiculous as it may seem, this woman, who by her own fortune and hervarious inheritances brought Pere Grandet more than three hundredthousand francs, had always felt so profoundly humiliated by herdependence and the slavery in which she lived, against which thegentleness of her spirit prevented her from revolting, that she hadnever asked for one penny or made a single remark on the deeds whichMaitre Cruchot brought for her signature. This foolish secret pride,this nobility of soul perpetually misunderstood and wounded byGrandet, ruled the whole conduct of the wife.

　　Madame Grandet was attired habitually in a gown of greenish levantinesilk, endeavoring to make it last nearly a year; with it she wore alarge kerchief of white cotton cloth, a bonnet made of plaited strawssewn together, and almost always a black-silk apron. As she seldomleft the house she wore out very few shoes. She never asked anythingfor herself. Grandet, seized with occasional remorse when heremembered how long a time had elapsed since he gave her the last sixfrancs, always stipulated for the "wife's pin-money" when he sold hisyearly vintage. The four or five louis presented by the Belgian or theDutchman who purchased the wine were the chief visible signs of MadameGrandet's annual revenues. But after she had received the five louis,her husband would often say to her, as though their purse were held incommon: "Can you lend me a few sous?" and the poor woman, glad to beable to do something for a man whom her confessor held up to her asher lord and master, returned him in the course of the winter severalcrowns out of the "pin-money." When Grandet drew from his pocket thefive-franc piece which he allowed monthly for the minor expenses,--thread, needles, and toilet,--of his daughter, he never failed to sayas he buttoned his breeches' pocket: "And you, mother, do you wantanything?"

　　"My friend," Madame Grandet would answer, moved by a sense of maternaldignity, "we will see about that later."

　　Wasted dignity! Grandet thought himself very generous to his wife.Philosophers who meet the like of Nanon, of Madame Grandet, ofEugenie, have surely a right to say that irony is at the bottom of theways of Providence.

　　After the dinner at which for the first time allusion had been made toEugenie's marriage, Nanon went to fetch a bottle of black-currantratafia from Monsieur Grandet's bed-chamber, and nearly fell as shecame down the stairs.

　　"You great stupid!" said her master; "are you going to tumble aboutlike other people, hey?"

　　"Monsieur, it was that step on your staircase which has given way.""She is right," said Madame Grandet; "it ought to have been mendedlong ago. Yesterday Eugenie nearly twisted her ankle."

　　"Here," said Grandet to Nanon, seeing that she looked quite pale, "asit is Eugenie's birthday, and you came near falling, take a littleglass of ratafia to set you right."

　　"Faith! I've earned it," said Nanon; "most people would have brokenthe bottle; but I'd sooner have broken my elbow holding it up high.""Poor Nanon!" said Grandet, filling a glass.

　　"Did you hurt yourself?" asked Eugenie, looking kindly at her."No, I didn't fall; I threw myself back on my haunches."

　　"Well! as it is Eugenie's birthday," said Grandet, "I'll have the stepmended. You people don't know how to set your foot in the corner wherethe wood is still firm."

　　Grandet took the candle, leaving his wife, daughter, and servantwithout any other light than that from the hearth, where the flameswere lively, and went into the bakehouse to fetch planks, nails, andtools.

　　"Can I help you?" cried Nanon, hearing him hammer on the stairs."No, no! I'm an old hand at it," answered the former cooper.At the moment when Grandet was mending his worm-eaten staircase andwhistling with all his might, in remembrance of the days of his youth,the three Cruchots knocked at the door.

　　"Is it you, Monsieur Cruchot?" asked Nanon, peeping through the littlegrating.

　　"Yes," answered the president.

　　Nanon opened the door, and the light from the hearth, reflected on theceiling, enabled the three Cruchots to find their way into the room."Ha! you've come a-greeting," said Nanon, smelling the flowers."Excuse me, messieurs," cried Grandet, recognizing their voices; "I'llbe with you in a moment. I'm not proud; I am patching up a step on mystaircase."

　　"Go on, go on, Monsieur Grandet; a man's house is his castle," saidthe president sententiously.

　　Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet rose. The president, profiting by thedarkness, said to Eugenie:

　　"Will you permit me, mademoiselle, to wish you, on this the day ofyour birth, a series of happy years and the continuance of the healthwhich you now enjoy?"

　　He offered her a huge bouquet of choice flowers which were rare inSaumur; then, taking the heiress by the elbows, he kissed her on eachside of her neck with a complacency that made her blush. Thepresident, who looked like a rusty iron nail, felt that his courtshipwas progressing.

　　"Don't stand on ceremony," said Grandet, entering. "How well you dothings on fete-days, Monsieur le president!"

　　"When it concerns mademoiselle," said the abbe, armed with his ownbouquet, "every day is a fete-day for my nephew."

　　The abbe kissed Eugenie's hand. As for Maitre Cruchot, he boldlykissed her on both cheeks, remarking: "How we sprout up, to be sure!Every year is twelve months."

　　As he replaced the candlestick beside the clock, Grandet, who neverforgot his own jokes, and repeated them to satiety when he thoughtthem funny, said,--

　　"As this is Eugenie's birthday let us illuminate."

　　He carefully took off the branches of the candelabra, put a socket oneach pedestal, took from Nanon a new tallow candle with paper twistedround the end of it, put it into the hollow, made it firm, lit it, andthen sat down beside his wife, looking alternately at his friends, hisdaughter, and the two candles. The Abbe Cruchot, a plump, puffy littleman, with a red wig plastered down and a face like an old femalegambler, said as he stretched out his feet, well shod in stout shoeswith silver buckles: "The des Grassins have not come?"

　　"Not yet," said Grandet.

　　"But are they coming?" asked the old notary, twisting his face, whichhad as many holes as a collander, into a queer grimace.

　　"I think so," answered Madame Grandet.

　　"Are your vintages all finished?" said Monsieur de Bonfons to Grandet."Yes, all of them," said the old man, rising to walk up and down theroom, his chest swelling with pride as he said the words, "all ofthem." Through the door of the passage which led to the kitchen he sawla Grande Nanon sitting beside her fire with a candle and preparing tospin there, so as not to intrude among the guests.

　　"Nanon," he said, going into the passage, "put out that fire and thatcandle, and come and sit with us. Pardieu! the hall is big enough forall."

　　"But monsieur, you are to have the great people."

　　"Are not you as good as they? They are descended from Adam, and so areyou."

　　Grandet came back to the president and said,--

　　"Have you sold your vintage?"

　　"No, not I; I shall keep it. If the wine is good this year, it will bebetter two years hence. The proprietors, you know, have made anagreement to keep up the price; and this year the Belgians won't getthe better of us. Suppose they are sent off empty-handed for once,faith! they'll come back."

　　"Yes, but let us mind what we are about," said Grandet in a tone whichmade the president tremble.

　　"Is he driving some bargain?" thought Cruchot.

　　At this moment the knocker announced the des Grassins family, andtheir arrival interrupted a conversation which had begun betweenMadame Grandet and the abbe.

　　Madame des Grassins was one of those lively, plump little women, withpink-and-white skins, who, thanks to the claustral calm of theprovinces and the habits of a virtuous life, keep their youth untilthey are past forty. She was like the last rose of autumn,--pleasantto the eye, though the petals have a certain frostiness, and theirperfume is slight. She dressed well, got her fashions from Paris, setthe tone to Saumur, and gave parties. Her husband, formerly aquartermaster in the Imperial guard, who had been desperately woundedat Austerlitz, and had since retired, still retained, in spite of hisrespect for Grandet, the seeming frankness of an old soldier."Good evening, Grandet," he said, holding out his hand and affecting asort of superiority, with which he always crushed the Cruchots."Mademoiselle," he added, turning to Eugenie, after bowing to MadameGrandet, "you are always beautiful and good, and truly I do not knowwhat to wish you." So saying, he offered her a little box which hisservant had brought and which contained a Cape heather,--a flowerlately imported into Europe and very rare.

　　Madame des Grassins kissed Eugenie very affectionately, pressed herhand, and said: "Adolphe wishes to make you my little offering."A tall, blond young man, pale and slight, with tolerable manners andseemingly rather shy, although he had just spent eight or ten thousandfrancs over his allowance in Paris, where he had been sent to studylaw, now came forward and kissed Eugenie on both cheeks, offering hera workbox with utensils in silver-gilt,--mere show-case trumpery, inspite of the monogram E.G. in gothic letters rather well engraved,which belonged properly to something in better taste. As she openedit, Eugenie experienced one of those unexpected and perfect delightswhich make a young girl blush and quiver and tremble with pleasure.She turned her eyes to her father as if to ask permission to acceptit, and Monsieur Grandet replied: "Take it, my daughter," in a tonewhich would have made an actor illustrious.

　　The three Cruchots felt crushed as they saw the joyous, animated lookcast upon Adolphe des Grassins by the heiress, to whom such richeswere unheard-of. Monsieur des Grassins offered Grandet a pinch ofsnuff, took one himself, shook off the grains as they fell on theribbon of the Legion of honor which was attached to the button-hole ofhis blue surtout; then he looked at the Cruchots with an air thatseemed to say, "Parry that thrust if you can!" Madame des Grassinscast her eyes on the blue vases which held the Cruchot bouquets,looking at the enemy's gifts with the pretended interest of asatirical woman. At this delicate juncture the Abbe Cruchot left thecompany seated in a circle round the fire and joined Grandet at thelower end of the hall. As the two men reached the embrasure of thefarthest window the priest said in the miser's ear: "Those peoplethrow money out of the windows."

　　"What does that matter if it gets into my cellar?" retorted the oldwine-grower.

　　"If you want to give gilt scissors to your daughter, you have themeans," said the abbe.

　　"I give her something better than scissors," answered Grandet."My nephew is a blockhead," thought the abbe as he looked at thepresident, whose rumpled hair added to the ill grace of his browncountenance. "Couldn't he have found some little trifle which costmoney?"

　　"We will join you at cards, Madame Grandet," said Madame des Grassins."We might have two tables, as we are all here."

　　"As it is Eugenie's birthday you had better play loto all together,"said Pere Grandet: "the two young ones can join"; and the old cooper,who never played any game, motioned to his daughter and Adolphe."Come, Nanon, set the tables."

　　"We will help you, Mademoiselle Nanon," said Madame des Grassinsgaily, quite joyous at the joy she had given Eugenie.

　　"I have never in my life been so pleased," the heiress said to her; "Ihave never seen anything so pretty."

　　"Adolphe brought it from Paris, and he chose it," Madame des Grassinswhispered in her ear.

　　"Go on! go on! damned intriguing thing!" thought the president. "Ifyou ever have a suit in court, you or your husband, it shall go hardwith you."

　　The notary, sitting in his corner, looked calmly at the abbe, sayingto himself: "The des Grassins may do what they like; my property andmy brother's and that of my nephew amount in all to eleven hundredthousand francs. The des Grassins, at the most, have not half that;besides, they have a daughter. They may give what presents they like;heiress and presents too will be ours one of these days."At half-past eight in the evening the two card-tables were set out.Madame des Grassins succeeded in putting her son beside Eugenie. Theactors in this scene, so full of interest, commonplace as it seems,were provided with bits of pasteboard striped in many colors andnumbered, and with counters of blue glass, and they appeared to belistening to the jokes of the notary, who never drew a number withoutmaking a remark, while in fact they were all thinking of MonsieurGrandet's millions. The old cooper, with inward self-conceit, wascontemplating the pink feathers and the fresh toilet of Madame desGrassins, the martial head of the banker, the faces of Adolphe, thepresident, the abbe, and the notary, saying to himself:--"They are all after my money. Hey! neither the one nor the other shallhave my daughter; but they are useful--useful as harpoons to fishwith."

　　This family gaiety in the old gray room dimly lighted by two tallowcandles; this laughter, accompanied by the whirr of Nanon's spinning-wheel, sincere only upon the lips of Eugenie or her mother; thistriviality mingled with important interests; this young girl, who,like certain birds made victims of the price put upon them, was nowlured and trapped by proofs of friendship of which she was the dupe,--all these things contributed to make the scene a melancholy comedy. Isit not, moreover, a drama of all times and all places, though herebrought down to its simplest expression? The figure of Grandet,playing his own game with the false friendship of the two families andgetting enormous profits from it, dominates the scene and throws lightupon it. The modern god,--the only god in whom faith is preserved,--money, is here, in all its power, manifested in a single countenance.The tender sentiments of life hold here but a secondary place; onlythe three pure, simple hearts of Nanon, of Eugenie, and of her motherwere inspired by them. And how much of ignorance there was in thesimplicity of these poor women! Eugenie and her mother knew nothing ofGrandet's wealth; they could only estimate the things of life by theglimmer of their pale ideas, and they neither valued nor despisedmoney, because they were accustomed to do without it. Their feelings,bruised, though they did not know it, but ever-living, were the secretspring of their existence, and made them curious exceptions in themidst of these other people whose lives were purely material.Frightful condition of the human race! there is no one of its joysthat does not come from some species of ignorance.

　　At the moment when Madame Grandet had won a loto of sixteen sous,--thelargest ever pooled in that house,--and while la Grande Nanon waslaughing with delight as she watched madame pocketing her riches, theknocker resounded on the house-door with such a noise that the womenall jumped in their chairs.

　　"There is no man in Saumur who would knock like that," said thenotary.

　　"How can they bang in that way!" exclaimed Nanon; "do they want tobreak in the door?"

　　"Who the devil is it?" cried Grandet.

　　III

　　Nanon took one of the candles and went to open the door, followed byher master.

　　"Grandet! Grandet!" cried his wife, moved by a sudden impulse of fear,and running to the door of the room.

　　All the players looked at each other.

　　"Suppose we all go?" said Monsieur des Grassins; "that knock strikesme as evil-intentioned."

　　Hardly was Monsieur des Grassins allowed to see the figure of a youngman, accompanied by a porter from the coach-office carrying two largetrunks and dragging a carpet-bag after him, than Monsieur Grandetturned roughly on his wife and said,--

　　"Madame Grandet, go back to your loto; leave me to speak withmonsieur."

　　Then he pulled the door quickly to, and the excited players returnedto their seats, but did not continue the game.

　　"Is it any one belonging to Saumur, Monsieur des Grassins?" asked hiswife.

　　"No, it is a traveller."

　　"He must have come from Paris."

　　"Just so," said the notary, pulling out his watch, which was twoinches thick and looked like a Dutch man-of-war; "it's nine o'clock;the diligence of the Grand Bureau is never late."

　　"Is the gentleman young?" inquired the Abbe Cruchot.

　　"Yes," answered Monsieur des Grassins, "and he has brought luggagewhich must weigh nearly three tons."

　　"Nanon does not come back," said Eugenie.

　　"It must be one of your relations," remarked the president."Let us go on with our game," said Madame Grandet gently. "I know fromMonsieur Grandet's tone of voice that he is annoyed; perhaps he wouldnot like to find us talking of his affairs."

　　"Mademoiselle," said Adolphe to his neighbor, "it is no doubt yourcousin Grandet,--a very good-looking young man; I met him at the ballof Monsieur de Nucingen." Adolphe did not go on, for his mother trodon his toes; and then, asking him aloud for two sous to put on herstake, she whispered: "Will you hold your tongue, you great goose!"At this moment Grandet returned, without la Grande Nanon, whose steps,together with those of the porter, echoed up the staircase; and he wasfollowed by the traveller who had excited such curiosity and so filledthe lively imaginations of those present that his arrival at thisdwelling, and his sudden fall into the midst of this assembly, canonly be likened to that of a snail into a beehive, or the introductionof a peacock into some village poultry-yard.

　　"Sit down near the fire," said Grandet.

　　Before seating himself, the young stranger saluted the assembledcompany very gracefully. The men rose to answer by a courteousinclination, and the women made a ceremonious bow.

　　"You are cold, no doubt, monsieur," said Madame Grandet; "you have,perhaps, travelled from--"

　　"Just like all women!" said the old wine-grower, looking up from aletter he was reading. "Do let monsieur rest himself!"

　　"But, father, perhaps monsieur would like to take something," saidEugenie.

　　"He has got a tongue," said the old man sternly.

　　The stranger was the only person surprised by this scene; all theothers were well-used to the despotic ways of the master. However,after the two questions and the two replies had been exchanged, thenewcomer rose, turned his back towards the fire, lifted one foot so asto warm the sole of its boot, and said to Eugenie,--

　　"Thank you, my cousin, but I dined at Tours. And," he added, lookingat Grandet, "I need nothing; I am not even tired."

　　"Monsieur has come from the capital?" asked Madame des Grassins.Monsieur Charles,--such was the name of the son of Monsieur Grandet ofParis,--hearing himself addressed, took a little eye-glass, suspendedby a chain from his neck, applied it to his right eye to examine whatwas on the table, and also the persons sitting round it. He ogledMadame des Grassins with much impertinence, and said to her, after hehad observed all he wished,--

　　"Yes, madame. You are playing at loto, aunt," he added. "Do not let meinterrupt you, I beg; go on with your game: it is too amusing toleave."

　　"I was certain it was the cousin," thought Madame des Grassins,casting repeated glances at him.

　　"Forty-seven!" cried the old abbe. "Mark it down, Madame des Grassins.Isn't that your number?"

　　Monsieur des Grassins put a counter on his wife's card, who satwatching first the cousin from Paris and then Eugenie, withoutthinking of her loto, a prey to mournful presentiments. From time totime the young the heiress glanced furtively at her cousin, and thebanker's wife easily detected a /crescendo/ of surprise and curiosityin her mind.

　　Monsieur Charles Grandet, a handsome young man of twenty-two,presented at this moment a singular contrast to the worthyprovincials, who, considerably disgusted by his aristocratic manners,were all studying him with sarcastic intent. This needs anexplanation. At twenty-two, young people are still so near childhoodthat they often conduct themselves childishly. In all probability, outof every hundred of them fully ninety-nine would have behavedprecisely as Monsieur Charles Grandet was now behaving.

　　Some days earlier than this his father had told him to go and spendseveral months with his uncle at Saumur. Perhaps Monsieur Grandet wasthinking of Eugenie. Charles, sent for the first time in his life intothe provinces, took a fancy to make his appearance with thesuperiority of a man of fashion, to reduce the whole arrondissement todespair by his luxury, and to make his visit an epoch, importing intothose country regions all the refinements of Parisian life. In short,to explain it in one word, he mean to pass more time at Saumur inbrushing his nails than he ever thought of doing in Paris, and toassume the extra nicety and elegance of dress which a young man offashion often lays aside for a certain negligence which in itself isnot devoid of grace. Charles therefore brought with him a completehunting-costume, the finest gun, the best hunting-knife in theprettiest sheath to be found in all Paris. He brought his wholecollection of waistcoats. They were of all kinds,--gray, black, white,scarabaeus-colored: some were shot with gold, some spangled, some/chined/; some were double-breasted and crossed like a shawl, otherswere straight in the collar; some had turned-over collars, somebuttoned up to the top with gilt buttons. He brought every variety ofcollar and cravat in fashion at that epoch. He brought two ofBuisson's coats and all his finest linen He brought his pretty goldtoilet-set,--a present from his mother. He brought all his dandyknick-knacks, not forgetting a ravishing little desk presented to himby the most amiable of women,--amiable for him, at least,--a fine ladywhom he called Annette and who at this moment was travelling,matrimonially and wearily, in Scotland, a victim to certain suspicionswhich required a passing sacrifice of happiness; in the desk was muchpretty note-paper on which to write to her once a fortnight.In short, it was as complete a cargo of Parisian frivolities as it waspossible for him to get together,--a collection of all the implementsof husbandry with which the youth of leisure tills his life, from thelittle whip which helps to begin a duel, to the handsomely chasedpistols which end it. His father having told him to travel alone andmodestly, he had taken the coupe of the diligence all to himself,rather pleased at not having to damage a delightful travelling-carriage ordered for a journey on which he was to meet his Annette,the great lady who, etc.,--whom he intended to rejoin at Baden in thefollowing June. Charles expected to meet scores of people at hisuncle's house, to hunt in his uncle's forests,--to live, in short, theusual chateau life; he did not know that his uncle was in Saumur, andhad only inquired about him incidentally when asking the way toFroidfond. Hearing that he was in town, he supposed that he shouldfind him in a suitable mansion.

　　In order that he might make a becoming first appearance before hisuncle either at Saumur or at Froidfond, he had put on his most eleganttravelling attire, simple yet exquisite,--"adorable," to use the wordwhich in those days summed up the special perfections of a man or athing. At Tours a hairdresser had re-curled his beautiful chestnutlocks; there he changed his linen and put on a black satin cravat,which, combined with a round shirt-collar, framed his fair and smilingcountenance agreeably. A travelling great-coat, only half buttoned up,nipped in his waist and disclosed a cashmere waistcoat crossed infront, beneath which was another waistcoat of white material. Hiswatch, negligently slipped into a pocket, was fastened by a short goldchain to a buttonhole. His gray trousers, buttoned up at the sides,were set off at the seams with patterns of black silk embroidery. Hegracefully twirled a cane, whose chased gold knob did not mar thefreshness of his gray gloves. And to complete all, his cap was inexcellent taste. None but a Parisian, and a Parisian of the upperspheres, could thus array himself without appearing ridiculous; noneother could give the harmony of self-conceit to all these fopperies,which were carried off, however, with a dashing air,--the air of ayoung man who has fine pistols, a sure aim, and Annette.

　　Now if you wish to understand the mutual amazement of the provincialparty and the young Parisian; if you would clearly see the brilliancewhich the traveller's elegance cast among the gray shadows of the roomand upon the faces of this family group,--endeavor to picture to yourminds the Cruchots. All three took snuff, and had long ceased torepress the habit of snivelling or to remove the brown blotches whichstrewed the frills of their dingy shirts and the yellowing creases oftheir crumpled collars. Their flabby cravats were twisted into ropesas soon as they wound them about their throats. The enormous quantityof linen which allowed these people to have their clothing washed onlyonce in six months, and to keep it during that time in the depths oftheir closets, also enabled time to lay its grimy and decaying stainsupon it. There was perfect unison of ill-grace and senility aboutthem; their faces, as faded as their threadbare coats, as creased astheir trousers, were worn-out, shrivelled-up, and puckered. As for theothers, the general negligence of their dress, which was incompleteand wanting in freshness,--like the toilet of all country places,where insensibly people cease to dress for others and come to thinkseriously of the price of a pair of gloves,--was in keeping with thenegligence of the Cruchots. A horror of fashion was the only point onwhich the Grassinists and the Cruchotines agreed.

　　When the Parisian took up his eye-glass to examine the strangeaccessories of this dwelling,--the joists of the ceiling, the color ofthe woodwork, and the specks which the flies had left there insufficient number to punctuate the "Moniteur" and the "Encyclopaediaof Sciences,"--the loto-players lifted their noses and looked at himwith as much curiosity as they might have felt about a giraffe.Monsieur des Grassins and his son, to whom the appearance of a man offashion was not wholly unknown, were nevertheless as much astonishedas their neighbors, whether it was that they fell under theindefinable influence of the general feeling, or that they reallyshared it as with satirical glances they seemed to say to theircompatriots,--

　　"That is what you see in Paris!"

　　They were able to examine Charles at their leisure without fearing todisplease the master of the house. Grandet was absorbed in the longletter which he held in his hand; and to read it he had taken the onlycandle upon the card-table, paying no heed to his guests or theirpleasure. Eugenie, to whom such a type of perfection, whether of dressor of person, was absolutely unknown, thought she beheld in her cousina being descended from seraphic spheres. She inhaled with delight thefragrance wafted from the graceful curls of that brilliant head. Shewould have liked to touch the soft kid of the delicate gloves. Sheenvied Charles his small hands, his complexion, the freshness andrefinement of his features. In short,--if it is possible to sum up theeffect this elegant being produced upon an ignorant young girlperpetually employed in darning stockings or in mending her father'sclothes, and whose life flowed on beneath these unclean rafters,seeing none but occasional passers along the silent street,--thisvision of her cousin roused in her soul an emotion of delicate desirelike that inspired in a young man by the fanciful pictures of womendrawn by Westall for the English "Keepsakes," and that engraved by theFindens with so clever a tool that we fear, as we breathe upon thepaper, that the celestial apparitions may be wafted away. Charles drewfrom his pocket a handkerchief embroidered by the great lady nowtravelling in Scotland. As Eugenie saw this pretty piece of work, donein the vacant hours which were lost to love, she looked at her cousinto see if it were possible that he meant to make use of it. Themanners of the young man, his gestures, the way in which he took uphis eye-glass, his affected superciliousness, his contemptuous glanceat the coffer which had just given so much pleasure to the richheiress, and which he evidently regarded as without value, or even asridiculous,--all these things, which shocked the Cruchots and the desGrassins, pleased Eugenie so deeply that before she slept she dreamedlong dreams of her phoenix cousin.

　　The loto-numbers were drawn very slowly, and presently the game camesuddenly to an end. La Grand Nanon entered and said aloud: "Madame, Iwant the sheets for monsieur's bed."

　　Madame Grandet followed her out. Madame des Grassins said in a lowvoice: "Let us keep our sous and stop playing." Each took his or hertwo sous from the chipped saucer in which they had been put; then theparty moved in a body toward the fire.

　　"Have you finished your game?" said Grandet, without looking up fromhis letter.

　　"Yes, yes!" replied Madame des Grassins, taking a seat near Charles.Eugenie, prompted by a thought often born in the heart of a young girlwhen sentiment enters it for the first time, left the room to go andhelp her mother and Nanon. Had an able confessor then questioned hershe would, no doubt, have avowed to him that she thought neither ofher mother nor of Nanon, but was pricked by a poignant desire to lookafter her cousin's room and concern herself with her cousin; to supplywhat might be needed, to remedy any forgetfulness, to see that all wasdone to make it, as far as possible, suitable and elegant; and, infact, she arrived in time to prove to her mother and Nanon thateverything still remained to be done. She put into Nanon's head thenotion of passing a warming-pan between the sheets. She herselfcovered the old table with a cloth and requested Nanon to change itevery morning; she convinced her mother that it was necessary to lighta good fire, and persuaded Nanon to bring up a great pile of wood intothe corridor without saying anything to her father. She ran to get,from one of the corner-shelves of the hall, a tray of old lacquerwhich was part of the inheritance of the late Monsieur de laBertelliere, catching up at the same time a six-sided crystal goblet,a little tarnished gilt spoon, an antique flask engraved with cupids,all of which she put triumphantly on the corner of her cousin'schimney-piece. More ideas surged through her head in one quarter of anhour than she had ever had since she came into the world."Mamma," she said, "my cousin will never bear the smell of a tallowcandle; suppose we buy a wax one?" And she darted, swift as a bird, toget the five-franc piece which she had just received for her monthlyexpenses. "Here, Nanon," she cried, "quick!"

　　"What will your father say?" This terrible remonstrance was uttered byMadame Grandet as she beheld her daughter armed with an old Sevressugar-basin which Grandet had brought home from the chateau ofFroidfond. "And where will you get the sugar? Are you crazy?""Mamma, Nanon can buy some sugar as well as the candle."

　　"But your father?"

　　"Surely his nephew ought not to go without a glass of /eau sucree/?Besides, he will not notice it."

　　"Your father sees everything," said Madame Grandet, shaking her head.Nanon hesitated; she knew her master.

　　"Come, Nanon, go,--because it is my birthday."

　　Nanon gave a loud laugh as she heard the first little jest her youngmistress had ever made, and then obeyed her.

　　While Eugenie and her mother were trying to embellish the bedroomassigned by Monsieur Grandet for his nephew, Charles himself was theobject of Madame des Grassins' attentions; to all appearances she wassetting her cap at him.

　　"You are very courageous, monsieur," she said to the young dandy, "toleave the pleasures of the capital at this season and take up yourabode in Saumur. But if we do not frighten you away, you will findthere are some amusements even here."

　　She threw him the ogling glance of the provinces, where women put somuch prudence and reserve into their eyes that they impart to them theprudish concupiscence peculiar to certain ecclesiastics to whom allpleasure is either a theft or an error. Charles was so completely outof his element in this abode, and so far from the vast chateau and thesumptuous life with which his fancy had endowed his uncle, that as helooked at Madame des Grassins he perceived a dim likeness to Parisianfaces. He gracefully responded to the species of invitation addressedto him, and began very naturally a conversation, in which Madame desGrassins gradually lowered her voice so as to bring it into harmonywith the nature of the confidences she was making. With her, as withCharles, there was the need of conference; so after a few momentsspent in coquettish phrases and a little serious jesting, the cleverprovincial said, thinking herself unheard by the others, who werediscussing the sale of wines which at that season filled the heads ofevery one in Saumur,--

　　"Monsieur if you will do us the honor to come and see us, you willgive as much pleasure to my husband as to myself. Our salon is theonly one in Saumur where you will find the higher business circlesmingling with the nobility. We belong to both societies, who meet atour house simply because they find it amusing. My husband--I say itwith pride--is as much valued by the one class as by the other. Wewill try to relieve the monotony of your visit here. If you stay allthe time with Monsieur Grandet, good heavens! what will become of you?Your uncle is a sordid miser who thinks of nothing but his vines; youraunt is a pious soul who can't put two ideas together; and your cousinis a little fool, without education, perfectly common, no fortune, whowill spend her life in darning towels."

　　"She is really very nice, this woman," thought Charles Grandet as heduly responded to Madame des Grassins' coquetries.

　　"It seems to me, wife, that you are taking possession of monsieur,"said the stout banker, laughing.

　　On this remark the notary and the president said a few words that weremore or less significant; but the abbe, looking at them slyly, broughttheir thoughts to a focus by taking a pinch of snuff and saying as hehanded round his snuff-box: "Who can do the honors of Saumur formonsieur so well as madame?"

　　"Ah! what do you mean by that, monsieur l'abbe?" demanded Monsieur desGrassins.

　　"I mean it in the best possible sense for you, for madame, for thetown of Saumur, and for monsieur," said the wily old man, turning toCharles.

　　The Abbe Cruchot had guessed the conversation between Charles andMadame des Grassins without seeming to pay attention to it."Monsieur," said Adolphe to Charles with an air which he tried to makefree and easy, "I don't know whether you remember me, but I had thehonor of dancing as your /vis-a-vis/ at a ball given by the Baron deNucingen, and--"

　　"Perfectly; I remember perfectly, monsieur," answered Charles, pleasedto find himself the object of general attention.

　　"Monsieur is your son?" he said to Madame des Grassins.

　　The abbe looked at her maliciously.

　　"Yes, monsieur," she answered.

　　"Then you were very young when you were in Paris?" said Charles,addressing Adolphe.

　　"You must know, monsieur," said the abbe, "that we send them toBabylon as soon as they are weaned."

　　Madame des Grassins examined the abbe with a glance of extremepenetration.

　　"It is only in the provinces," he continued, "that you will find womenof thirty and more years as fresh as madame, here, with a son about totake his degree. I almost fancy myself back in the days when the youngmen stood on chairs in the ball-room to see you dance, madame," saidthe abbe, turning to his female adversary. "To me, your triumphs arebut of yesterday--"

　　"The old rogue!" thought Madame Grassins; "can he have guessed myintentions?"

　　"It seems that I shall have a good deal of success in Saumur," thoughtCharles as he unbuttoned his great-coat, put a hand into hiswaistcoat, and cast a glance into the far distance, to imitate theattitude which Chantrey has given to Lord Byron.

　　The inattention of Pere Grandet, or, to speak more truly, thepreoccupation of mind into which the reading of the letter had plungedhim, did not escape the vigilance of the notary and the president, whotried to guess the contents of the letter by the almost imperceptiblemotions of the miser's face, which was then under the full light ofthe candle. He maintained the habitual calm of his features withevident difficulty; we may, in fact, picture to ourselves thecountenance such a man endeavored to preserve as he read the fatalletter which here follows:--

　　My Brother,--It is almost twenty-three years since we have seen

　　each other. My marriage was the occasion of our last interview,

　　after which we parted, and both of us were happy. Assuredly I

　　could not then foresee that you would one day be the prop of the

　　family whose prosperity you then predicted.

　　When you hold this letter within your hands I shall be no longer

　　living. In the position I now hold I cannot survive the disgrace

　　of bankruptcy. I have waited on the edge of the gulf until the

　　last moment, hoping to save myself. The end has come, I must sink

　　into it. The double bankruptcies of my broker and of Roguin, my

　　notary, have carried off my last resources and left me nothing. I

　　have the bitterness of owing nearly four millions, with assets not

　　more than twenty-five per cent in value to pay them. The wines in

　　my warehouses suffer from the fall in prices caused by the

　　abundance and quality of your vintage. In three days Paris will

　　cry out: "Monsieur Grandet was a knave!" and I, an honest man,

　　shall be lying in my winding-sheet of infamy. I deprive my son of

　　a good name, which I have stained, and the fortune of his mother,

　　which I have lost. He knows nothing of all this,--my unfortunate

　　child whom I idolize! We parted tenderly. He was ignorant,

　　happily, that the last beatings of my heart were spent in that

　　farewell. Will he not some day curse me? My brother, my brother!

　　the curses of our children are horrible; they can appeal against

　　ours, but theirs are irrevocable. Grandet, you are my elder

　　brother, you owe me your protection; act for me so that Charles

　　may cast no bitter words upon my grave! My brother, if I were

　　writing with my blood, with my tears, no greater anguish could I

　　put into this letter,--nor as great, for then I should weep, I

　　should bleed, I should die, I should suffer no more, but now I

　　suffer and look at death with dry eyes.

　　From henceforth you are my son's father; he has no relations, as

　　you well know, on his mother's side. Why did I not consider social

　　prejudices? Why did I yield to love? Why did I marry the natural

　　daughter of a great lord? Charles has no family. Oh, my unhappy

　　son! my son! Listen, Grandet! I implore nothing for myself,--

　　besides, your property may not be large enough to carry a mortgage

　　of three millions,--but for my son! Brother, my suppliant hands

　　are clasped as I think of you; behold them! Grandet, I confide my

　　son to you in dying, and I look at the means of death with less

　　pain as I think that you will be to him a father. He loved me

　　well, my Charles; I was good to him, I never thwarted him; he will

　　not curse me. Ah, you see! he is gentle, he is like his mother, he

　　will cause you no grief. Poor boy! accustomed to all the

　　enjoyments of luxury, he knows nothing of the privations to which

　　you and I were condemned by the poverty of our youth. And I leave

　　him ruined! alone! Yes, all my friends will avoid him, and it is I

　　who have brought this humiliation upon him! Would that I had the

　　force to send him with one thrust into the heavens to his mother's

　　side! Madness! I come back to my disaster--to his. I send him to

　　you that you may tell him in some fitting way of my death, of his

　　future fate. Be a father to him, but a good father. Do not tear

　　him all at once from his idle life, it would kill him. I beg him

　　on my knees to renounce all rights that, as his mother's heir, he

　　may have on my estate. But the prayer is superfluous; he is

　　honorable, and he will feel that he must not appear among my

　　creditors. Bring him to see this at the right time; reveal to him

　　the hard conditions of the life I have made for him: and if he

　　still has tender thoughts of me, tell him in my name that all is

　　not lost for him. Yes, work, labor, which saved us both, may give

　　him back the fortune of which I have deprived him; and if he

　　listens to his father's voice as it reaches him from the grave, he

　　will go the Indies. My brother, Charles is an upright and

　　courageous young man; give him the wherewithal to make his

　　venture; he will die sooner than not repay you the funds which you

　　may lend him. Grandet! if you will not do this, you will lay up

　　for yourself remorse. Ah, should my child find neither tenderness

　　nor succor in you, I would call down the vengeance of God upon

　　your cruelty!

　　If I had been able to save something from the wreck, I might have

　　had the right to leave him at least a portion of his mother's

　　property; but my last monthly payments have absorbed everything. I

　　did not wish to die uncertain of my child's fate; I hoped to feel

　　a sacred promise in a clasp of your hand which might have warmed

　　my heart: but time fails me. While Charles is journeying to you I

　　shall be preparing my assignment. I shall endeavor to show by the

　　order and good faith of my accounts that my disaster comes neither

　　from a faulty life nor from dishonesty. It is for my son's sake

　　that I strive to do this.

　　Farewell, my brother! May the blessing of God be yours for the

　　generous guardianship I lay upon you, and which, I doubt not, you

　　will accept. A voice will henceforth and forever pray for you in

　　that world where we must all go, and where I am now as you read

　　these lines.

　　Victor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet.

　　"So you are talking?" said Pere Grandet as he carefully folded theletter in its original creases and put it into his waistcoat-pocket.He looked at his nephew with a humble, timid air, beneath which he hidhis feelings and his calculations. "Have you warmed yourself?" he saidto him.

　　"Thoroughly, my dear uncle."

　　"Well, where are the women?" said his uncle, already forgetting thathis nephew was to sleep at the house. At this moment Eugenie andMadame Grandet returned.

　　"Is the room all ready?" said Grandet, recovering his composure."Yes, father."

　　"Well then, my nephew, if you are tired, Nanon shall show you yourroom. It isn't a dandy's room; but you will excuse a poor wine-growerwho never has a penny to spare. Taxes swallow up everything.""We do not wish to intrude, Grandet," said the banker; "you may wantto talk to your nephew, and therefore we will bid you good-night."At these words the assembly rose, and each made a parting bow inkeeping with his or her own character. The old notary went to the doorto fetch his lantern and came back to light it, offering to accompanythe des Grassins on their way. Madame des Grassins had not foreseenthe incident which brought the evening prematurely to an end, herservant therefore had not arrived.

　　"Will you do me the honor to take my arm, madame?" said the abbe."Thank you, monsieur l'abbe, but I have my son," she answered dryly."Ladies cannot compromise themselves with me," said the abbe."Take Monsieur Cruchot's arm," said her husband.

　　The abbe walked off with the pretty lady so quickly that they weresoon some distance in advance of the caravan.

　　"That is a good-looking young man, madame," he said, pressing her arm."Good-by to the grapes, the vintage is done. It is all over with us.We may as well say adieu to Mademoiselle Grandet. Eugenie will belongto the dandy. Unless this cousin is enamoured of some Parisian woman,your son Adolphe will find another rival in--"

　　"Not at all, monsieur l'abbe. This young man cannot fail to see thatEugenie is a little fool,--a girl without the least freshness. Did younotice her to-night? She was as yellow as a quince."

　　"Perhaps you made the cousin notice it?"

　　"I did not take the trouble--"

　　"Place yourself always beside Eugenie, madame, and you need never takethe trouble to say anything to the young man against his cousin; hewill make his own comparisons, which--"

　　"Well, he has promised to dine with me the day after to-morrow.""Ah! if you only /would/, madame--" said the abbe.

　　"What is it that you wish me to do, monsieur l'abbe? Do you mean tooffer me bad advice? I have not reached the age of thirty-nine,without a stain upon my reputation, thank God! to compromise myselfnow, even for the empire of the Great Mogul. You and I are of an agewhen we both know the meaning of words. For an ecclesiastic, youcertainly have ideas that are very incongruous. Fie! it is worthy ofFaublas!"

　　"You have read Faublas?"

　　"No, monsieur l'abbe; I meant to say the /Liaisons dangereuses/.""Ah! that book is infinitely more moral," said the abbe, laughing."But you make me out as wicked as a young man of the present day; Ionly meant--"

　　"Do you dare to tell me you were not thinking of putting wicked thingsinto my head? Isn't it perfectly clear? If this young man--who I admitis very good-looking--were to make love to me, he would not think ofhis cousin. In Paris, I know, good mothers do devote themselves inthis way to the happiness and welfare of their children; but we livein the provinces, monsieur l'abbe."

　　"Yes, madame."

　　"And," she continued, "I do not want, and Adolphe himself would notwant, a hundred millions brought at such a price."

　　"Madame, I said nothing about a hundred millions; that temptationmight be too great for either of us to withstand. Only, I do thinkthat an honest woman may permit herself, in all honor, certainharmless little coquetries, which are, in fact, part of her socialduty and which--"

　　"Do you think so?"

　　"Are we not bound, madame, to make ourselves agreeable to each other?--Permit me to blow my nose.--I assure you, madame," he resumed, "thatthe young gentleman ogled you through his glass in a more flatteringmanner than he put on when he looked at me; but I forgive him fordoing homage to beauty in preference to old age--"

　　"It is quite apparent," said the president in his loud voice, "thatMonsieur Grandet of Paris has sent his son to Saumur with extremelymatrimonial intentions."

　　"But in that case the cousin wouldn't have fallen among us like acannon-ball," answered the notary.

　　"That doesn't prove anything," said Monsieur des Grassins; "the oldmiser is always making mysteries."

　　"Des Grassins, my friend, I have invited the young man to dinner. Youmust go and ask Monsieur and Madame de Larsonniere and the du Hautoys,with the beautiful demoiselle du Hautoy, of course. I hope she will beproperly dressed; that jealous mother of hers does make such a frightof her! Gentlemen, I trust that you will all do us the honor to come,"she added, stopping the procession to address the two Cruchots."Here you are at home, madame," said the notary.

　　After bowing to the three des Grassins, the three Cruchots returnedhome, applying their provincial genius for analysis to studying, underall its aspects, the great event of the evening, which undoubtedlychanged the respective positions of Grassinists and Cruchotines. Theadmirable common-sense which guided all the actions of these greatmachinators made each side feel the necessity of a momentary allianceagainst a common enemy. Must they not mutually hinder Eugenie fromloving her cousin, and the cousin from thinking of Eugenie? Could theParisian resist the influence of treacherous insinuations, soft-spokencalumnies, slanders full of faint praise and artless denials, whichshould be made to circle incessantly about him and deceive him?IV

　　When the four relations were left alone, Monsieur Grandet said to hisnephew,--

　　"We must go to bed. It is too late to talk about the matters whichhave brought you here; to-morrow we will take a suitable moment. Webreakfast at eight o'clock; at midday we eat a little fruit or a bitof bread, and drink a glass of white wine; and we dine, like theParisians, at five o'clock. That's the order of the day. If you liketo go and see the town and the environs you are free to do so. Youwill excuse me if my occupations do not permit me to accompany you.You may perhaps hear people say that I am rich,--Monsieur Grandetthis, Monsieur Grandet that. I let them talk; their gossip does nothurt my credit. But I have not a penny; I work in my old age like anapprentice whose worldly goods are a bad plane and two good arms.Perhaps you'll soon know yourself what a franc costs when you have gotto sweat for it. Nanon, where are the candles?"

　　"I trust, my nephew, that you will find all you want," said MadameGrandet; "but if you should need anything else, you can call Nanon.""My dear aunt, I shall need nothing; I have, I believe, broughteverything with me. Permit me to bid you good-night, and my youngcousin also."

　　Charles took a lighted wax candle from Nanon's hand,--an Anjou candle,very yellow in color, and so shopworn that it looked like tallow anddeceived Monsieur Grandet, who, incapable of suspecting its presenceunder his roof, did not perceive this magnificence.

　　"I will show you the way," he said.

　　Instead of leaving the hall by the door which opened under thearchway, Grandet ceremoniously went through the passage which dividedthe hall from the kitchen. A swing-door, furnished with a large ovalpane of glass, shut this passage from the staircase, so as to fend offthe cold air which rushed through it. But the north wind whistled nonethe less keenly in winter, and, in spite of the sand-bags at thebottom of the doors of the living-room, the temperature within couldscarcely be kept at a proper height. Nanon went to bolt the outerdoor; then she closed the hall and let loose a wolf-dog, whose barkwas so strangled that he seemed to have laryngitis. This animal, notedfor his ferocity, recognized no one but Nanon; the two untutoredchildren of the fields understood each other.

　　When Charles saw the yellow, smoke-stained walls of the well of thestaircase, where each worm-eaten step shook under the heavy foot-fallof his uncle, his expectations began to sober more and more. Hefancied himself in a hen-roost. His aunt and cousin, to whom he turnedan inquiring look, were so used to the staircase that they did notguess the cause of his amazement, and took the glance for anexpression of friendliness, which they answered by a smile that madehim desperate.

　　"Why the devil did my father send me to such a place?" he said tohimself.

　　When they reached the first landing he saw three doors painted inEtruscan red and without casings,--doors sunk in the dusty walls andprovided with iron bars, which in fact were bolts, each ending withthe pattern of a flame, as did both ends of the long sheath of thelock. The first door at the top of the staircase, which opened into aroom directly above the kitchen, was evidently walled up. In fact, theonly entrance to that room was through Grandet's bedchamber; the roomitself was his office. The single window which lighted it, on the sideof the court, was protected by a lattice of strong iron bars. No one,not even Madame Grandet, had permission to enter it. The old man choseto be alone, like an alchemist in his laboratory. There, no doubt,some hiding-place had been ingeniously constructed; there the title-deeds of property were stored; there hung the scales on which to weighthe louis; there were devised, by night and secretly, the estimates,the profits, the receipts, so that business men, finding Grandetprepared at all points, imagined that he got his cue from fairies ordemons; there, no doubt, while Nanon's loud snoring shook the rafters,while the wolf-dog watched and yawned in the courtyard, while Madameand Mademoiselle Grandet were quietly sleeping, came the old cooper tocuddle, to con over, to caress and clutch and clasp his gold. Thewalls were thick, the screens sure. He alone had the key of thislaboratory, where--so people declared--he studied the maps on whichhis fruit-trees were marked, and calculated his profits to a vine, andalmost to a twig.

　　The door of Eugenie's chamber was opposite to the walled-up entranceto this room. At the other end of the landing were the appartements ofthe married pair, which occupied the whole front of the house. MadameGrandet had a room next to that of Eugenie, which was entered througha glass door. The master's chamber was separated from that of his wifeby a partition, and from the mysterious strong-room by a thick wall.Pere Grandet lodged his nephew on the second floor, in the highmansarde attic which was above his own bedroom, so that he might hearhim if the young man took it into his head to go and come. WhenEugenie and her mother reached the middle of the landing they kissedeach other for good-night; then with a few words of adieu to Charles,cold upon the lips, but certainly very warm in the heart of the younggirl, they withdrew into their own chambers.

　　"Here you are in your room, my nephew," said Pere Grandet as he openedthe door. "If you need to go out, call Nanon; without her, beware! thedog would eat you up without a word. Sleep well. Good-night. Ha! why,they have made you a fire!" he cried.

　　At this moment Nanon appeared with the warming pan.

　　"Here's something more!" said Monsieur Grandet. "Do you take my nephewfor a lying-in woman? Carry off your brazier, Nanon!"

　　"But, monsieur, the sheets are damp, and this gentleman is as delicateas a woman."

　　"Well, go on, as you've taken it into your head," said Grandet,pushing her by the shoulders; "but don't set things on fire." Sosaying, the miser went down-stairs, grumbling indistinct sentences.Charles stood aghast in the midst of his trunks. After casting hiseyes on the attic-walls covered with that yellow paper sprinkled withbouquets so well known in dance-houses, on the fireplace of ribbedstone whose very look was chilling, on the chairs of yellow wood withvarnished cane seats that seemed to have more than the usual fourangles, on the open night-table capacious enough to hold a smallsergeant-at-arms, on the meagre bit of rag-carpet beside the bed, onthe tester whose cloth valance shook as if, devoured by moths, it wasabout to fall, he turned gravely to la Grande Nanon and said,--"Look here! my dear woman, just tell me, am I in the house of MonsieurGrandet, formerly mayor of Saumur, and brother to Monsieur Grandet ofParis?"

　　"Yes, monsieur; and a very good, a very kind, a very perfectgentleman. Shall I help you to unpack your trunks?"

　　"Faith! yes, if you will, my old trooper. Didn't you serve in themarines of the Imperial Guard?"

　　"Ho, ho, ho!" laughed Nanon. "What's that,--the marines of the guard?Is it salt? Does it go in the water?"

　　"Here, get me my dressing-gown out of that valise; there's the key."Nanon was wonder-struck by the sight of a dressing-gown made of greensilk, brocaded with gold flowers of an antique design.

　　"Are you going to put that on to go to bed with?" she asked."Yes."

　　"Holy Virgin! what a beautiful altar-cloth it would make for theparish church! My dear darling monsieur, give it to the church, andyou'll save your soul; if you don't, you'll lose it. Oh, how nice youlook in it! I must call mademoiselle to see you."

　　"Come, Nanon, if Nanon you are, hold your tongue; let me go to bed.I'll arrange my things to-morrow. If my dressing-gown pleases you somuch, you shall save your soul. I'm too good a Christian not to giveit to you when I go away, and you can do what you like with it."Nanon stood rooted to the ground, gazing at Charles and unable to putfaith into his words.

　　"Good night, Nanon."

　　"What in the world have I come here for?" thought Charles as he wentto sleep. "My father is not a fool; my journey must have some object.Pshaw! put off serious thought till the morrow, as some Greek idiotsaid."

　　"Blessed Virgin! how charming he is, my cousin!" Eugenie was saying,interrupting her prayers, which that night at least were neverfinished.

　　Madame Grandet had no thoughts at all as she went to bed. She heardthe miser walking up and down his room through the door ofcommunication which was in the middle of the partition. Like all timidwomen, she had studied the character of her lord. Just as the petrelforesees the storm, she knew by imperceptible signs when an inwardtempest shook her husband; and at such times, to use an expression ofher own, she "feigned dead."

　　Grandet gazed at the door lined with sheet-iron which he lately put tohis sanctum, and said to himself,--

　　"What a crazy idea of my brother to bequeath his son to me! A finelegacy! I have not fifty francs to give him. What are fifty francs toa dandy who looked at my barometer as if he meant to make firewood ofit!"

　　In thinking over the consequences of that legacy of anguish Grandetwas perhaps more agitated than his brother had been at the moment ofwriting it.

　　"I shall have that golden robe," thought Nanon, who went to sleeptricked out in her altar-cloth, dreaming for the first time in herlife of flowers, embroidery, and damask, just as Eugenie was dreamingof love.

　　*****

　　In the pure and monotonous life of young girls there comes a delicioushour when the sun sheds its rays into their soul, when the flowersexpress their thoughts, when the throbbings of the heart send upwardto the brain their fertilizing warmth and melt all thoughts into avague desire,--day of innocent melancholy and of dulcet joys! Whenbabes begin to see, they smile; when a young girl first perceives thesentiment of nature, she smiles as she smiled when an infant. If lightis the first love of life, is not love a light to the heart? Themoment to see within the veil of earthly things had come for Eugenie.An early riser, like all provincial girls, she was up betimes and saidher prayers, and then began the business of dressing,--a businesswhich henceforth was to have a meaning. First she brushed and smoothedher chestnut hair and twisted its heavy masses to the top of her headwith the utmost care, preventing the loose tresses from straying, andgiving to her head a symmetry which heightened the timid candor of herface; for the simplicity of these accessories accorded well with theinnocent sincerity of its lines. As she washed her hands again andagain in the cold water which hardened and reddened the skin, shelooked at her handsome round arms and asked herself what her cousindid to make his hands so softly white, his nails so delicately curved.She put on new stockings and her prettiest shoes. She laced her corsetstraight, without skipping a single eyelet. And then, wishing for thefirst time in her life to appear to advantage, she felt the joy ofhaving a new gown, well made, which rendered her attractive.As she finished her toilet the clock of the parish church struck thehour; to her astonishment, it was only seven. The desire of havingplenty of time for dressing carefully had led her to get up too early.Ignorant of the art of retouching every curl and studying everyeffect, Eugenie simply crossed her arms, sat down by the window, andlooked at the court-yard, the narrow garden, and the high terracedwalls that over-topped it: a dismal, hedged-in prospect, yet notwholly devoid of those mysterious beauties which belong to solitary oruncultivated nature. Near the kitchen was a well surrounded by a curb,with a pulley fastened to a bent iron rod clasped by a vine whoseleaves were withered, reddened, and shrivelled by the season. Fromthence the tortuous shoots straggled to the wall, clutched it, and ranthe whole length of the house, ending near the wood-pile, where thelogs were ranged with as much precision as the books in a library. Thepavement of the court-yard showed the black stains produced in time bylichens, herbage, and the absence of all movement or friction. Thethick walls wore a coating of green moss streaked with waving brownlines, and the eight stone steps at the bottom of the court-yard whichled up to the gate of the garden were disjointed and hidden beneathtall plants, like the tomb of a knight buried by his widow in the daysof the Crusades. Above a foundation of moss-grown, crumbling stoneswas a trellis of rotten wood, half fallen from decay; over themclambered and intertwined at will a mass of clustering creepers. Oneach side of the latticed gate stretched the crooked arms of twostunted apple-trees. Three parallel walks, gravelled and separatedfrom each other by square beds, where the earth was held in by box-borders, made the garden, which terminated, beneath a terrace of theold walls, in a group of lindens. At the farther end were raspberry-bushes; at the other, near the house, an immense walnut-tree droopedits branches almost into the window of the miser's sanctum.A clear day and the beautiful autumnal sun common to the banks of theLoire was beginning to melt the hoar-frost which the night had laid onthese picturesque objects, on the walls, and on the plants whichswathed the court-yard. Eugenie found a novel charm in the aspect ofthings lately so insignificant to her. A thousand confused thoughtscame to birth in her mind and grew there, as the sunbeams grew withoutalong the wall. She felt that impulse of delight, vague, inexplicable,which wraps the moral being as a cloud wraps the physical body. Herthoughts were all in keeping with the details of this strangelandscape, and the harmonies of her heart blended with the harmoniesof nature. When the sun reached an angle of the wall where the "Venus-hair" of southern climes drooped its thick leaves, lit with thechanging colors of a pigeon's breast, celestial rays of hope illuminedthe future to her eyes, and thenceforth she loved to gaze upon thatpiece of wall, on its pale flowers, its blue harebells, its wiltingherbage, with which she mingled memories as tender as those ofchildhood. The noise made by each leaf as it fell from its twig in thevoid of that echoing court gave answer to the secret questionings ofthe young girl, who could have stayed there the livelong day withoutperceiving the flight of time. Then came tumultuous heavings of thesoul. She rose often, went to her glass, and looked at herself, as anauthor in good faith looks at his work to criticise it and blame it inhis own mind.

　　"I am not beautiful enough for him!" Such was Eugenie's thought,--ahumble thought, fertile in suffering. The poor girl did not do herselfjustice; but modesty, or rather fear, is among the first of love'svirtues. Eugenie belonged to the type of children with sturdyconstitutions, such as we see among the lesser bourgeoisie, whosebeauties always seem a little vulgar; and yet, though she resembledthe Venus of Milo, the lines of her figure were ennobled by the softerChristian sentiment which purifies womanhood and gives it adistinction unknown to the sculptors of antiquity. She had an enormoushead, with the masculine yet delicate forehead of the Jupiter ofPhidias, and gray eyes, to which her chaste life, penetrating fullyinto them, carried a flood of light. The features of her round face,formerly fresh and rosy, were at one time swollen by the small-pox,which destroyed the velvet texture of the skin, though it kindly leftno other traces, and her cheek was still so soft and delicate that hermother's kiss made a momentary red mark upon it. Her nose was somewhattoo thick, but it harmonized well with the vermilion mouth, whoselips, creased in many lines, were full of love and kindness. Thethroat was exquisitely round. The bust, well curved and carefullycovered, attracted the eye and inspired reverie. It lacked, no doubt,the grace which a fitting dress can bestow; but to a connoisseur thenon-flexibility of her figure had its own charm. Eugenie, tall andstrongly made, had none of the prettiness which pleases the masses;but she was beautiful with a beauty which the spirit recognizes, andnone but artists truly love. A painter seeking here below for a typeof Mary's celestial purity, searching womankind for those proud modesteyes which Raphael divined, for those virgin lines, often due tochances of conception, which the modesty of Christian life alone canbestow or keep unchanged,--such a painter, in love with his ideal,would have found in the face of Eugenie the innate nobleness that isignorant of itself; he would have seen beneath the calmness of thatbrow a world of love; he would have felt, in the shape of the eyes, inthe fall of the eyelids, the presence of the nameless something thatwe call divine. Her features, the contour of her head, which noexpression of pleasure had ever altered or wearied, were like thelines of the horizon softly traced in the far distance across thetranquil lakes. That calm and rosy countenance, margined with lightlike a lovely full-blown flower, rested the mind, held the eye, andimparted the charm of the conscience that was there reflected. Eugeniewas standing on the shore of life where young illusions flower, wheredaisies are gathered with delights ere long to be unknown; and thusshe said, looking at her image in the glass, unconscious as yet oflove: "I am too ugly; he will not notice me."

　　Then she opened the door of her chamber which led to the staircase,and stretched out her neck to listen for the household noises. "He isnot up," she thought, hearing Nanon's morning cough as the good soulwent and came, sweeping out the halls, lighting her fire, chaining thedog, and speaking to the beasts in the stable. Eugenie at once wentdown and ran to Nanon, who was milking the cow.

　　"Nanon, my good Nanon, make a little cream for my cousin's breakfast.""Why, mademoiselle, you should have thought of that yesterday," saidNanon, bursting into a loud peal of laughter. "I can't make cream.Your cousin is a darling, a darling! oh, that he is! You should haveseen him in his dressing-gown, all silk and gold! I saw him, I did! Hewears linen as fine as the surplice of monsieur le cure.""Nanon, please make us a /galette/."

　　"And who'll give me wood for the oven, and flour and butter for thecakes?" said Nanon, who in her function of prime-minister to Grandetassumed at times enormous importance in the eyes of Eugenie and hermother. "Mustn't rob the master to feast the cousin. You ask him forbutter and flour and wood: he's your father, perhaps he'll give yousome. See! there he is now, coming to give out the provisions."Eugenie escaped into the garden, quite frightened as she heard thestaircase shaking under her father's step. Already she felt theeffects of that virgin modesty and that special consciousness ofhappiness which lead us to fancy, not perhaps without reason, that ourthoughts are graven on our foreheads and are open to the eyes of all.Perceiving for the first time the cold nakedness of her father'shouse, the poor girl felt a sort of rage that she could not put it inharmony with her cousin's elegance. She felt the need of doingsomething for him,--what, she did not know. Ingenuous and truthful,she followed her angelic nature without mistrusting her impressions orher feelings. The mere sight of her cousin had wakened within her thenatural yearnings of a woman,--yearnings that were the more likely todevelop ardently because, having reached her twenty-third year, shewas in the plenitude of her intelligence and her desires. For thefirst time in her life her heart was full of terror at the sight ofher father; in him she saw the master of the fate, and she fanciedherself guilty of wrong-doing in hiding from his knowledge certainthoughts. She walked with hasty steps, surprised to breathe a purerair, to feel the sun's rays quickening her pulses, to absorb fromtheir heat a moral warmth and a new life. As she turned over in hermind some stratagem by which to get the cake, a quarrel--an event asrare as the sight of swallows in winter--broke out between la GrandeNanon and Grandet. Armed with his keys, the master had come to doleout provisions for the day's consumption.

　　"Is there any bread left from yesterday?" he said to Nanon."Not a crumb, monsieur."

　　Grandet took a large round loaf, well floured and moulded in one ofthe flat baskets which they use for baking in Anjou, and was about tocut it, when Nanon said to him,--

　　"We are five, to-day, monsieur."

　　"That's true," said Grandet, "but your loaves weigh six pounds;there'll be some left. Besides, these young fellows from Paris don'teat bread, you'll see."

　　"Then they must eat /frippe/?" said Nanon.

　　/Frippe/ is a word of the local lexicon of Anjou, and means anyaccompaniment of bread, from butter which is spread upon it, thecommonest kind of /frippe/, to peach preserve, the most distinguishedof all the /frippes/; those who in their childhood have licked the/frippe/ and left the bread, will comprehend the meaning of Nanon'sspeech.

　　"No," answered Grandet, "they eat neither bread nor /frippe/; they aresomething like marriageable girls."

　　After ordering the meals for the day with his usual parsimony, thegoodman, having locked the closets containing the supplies, was aboutto go towards the fruit-garden, when Nanon stopped him to say,--"Monsieur, give me a little flour and some butter, and I'll make a/galette/ for the young ones."

　　"Are you going to pillage the house on account of my nephew?""I wasn't thinking any more of your nephew than I was of your dog,--not more than you think yourself; for, look here, you've only forkedout six bits of sugar. I want eight."

　　"What's all this, Nanon? I have never seen you like this before. Whathave you got in your head? Are you the mistress here? You sha'n't havemore than six pieces of sugar."

　　"Well, then, how is your nephew to sweeten his coffee?"

　　"With two pieces; I'll go without myself."

　　"Go without sugar at your age! I'd rather buy you some out of my ownpocket."

　　"Mind your own business."

　　In spite of the recent fall in prices, sugar was still in Grandet'seyes the most valuable of all the colonial products; to him it wasalways six francs a pound. The necessity of economizing it, acquiredunder the Empire, had grown to be the most inveterate of his habits.All women, even the greatest ninnies, know how to dodge and dodge toget their ends; Nanon abandoned the sugar for the sake of getting the/galette/.

　　"Mademoiselle!" she called through the window, "do you want some/galette/?"

　　"No, no," answered Eugenie.

　　"Come, Nanon," said Grandet, hearing his daughter's voice. "See here."He opened the cupboard where the flour was kept, gave her a cupful,and added a few ounces of butter to the piece he had already cut off."I shall want wood for the oven," said the implacable Nanon."Well, take what you want," he answered sadly; "but in that case youmust make us a fruit-tart, and you'll cook the whole dinner in theoven. In that way you won't need two fires."

　　"Goodness!" cried Nanon, "you needn't tell me that."

　　Grandet cast a look that was well-nigh paternal upon his faithfuldeputy.

　　"Mademoiselle," she cried, when his back was turned, "we shall havethe /galette/."

　　Pere Grandet returned from the garden with the fruit and arranged aplateful on the kitchen-table.

　　"Just see, monsieur," said Nanon, "what pretty boots your nephew has.What leather! why it smells good! What does he clean it with, Iwonder? Am I to put your egg-polish on it?"

　　"Nanon, I think eggs would injure that kind of leather. Tell him youdon't know how to black morocco; yes, that's morocco. He will get yousomething himself in Saumur to polish those boots with. I have heardthat they put sugar into the blacking to make it shine."

　　"They look good to eat," said the cook, putting the boots to her nose."Bless me! if they don't smell like madame's eau-de-cologne. Ah! howfunny!"

　　"Funny!" said her master. "Do you call it funny to put more money intoboots than the man who stands in them is worth?"

　　"Monsieur," she said, when Grandet returned the second time, afterlocking the fruit-garden, "won't you have the /pot-au-feu/ put on onceor twice a week on account of your nephew?"

　　"Yes."

　　"Am I to go to the butcher's?"

　　"Certainly not. We will make the broth of fowls; the farmers willbring them. I shall tell Cornoiller to shoot some crows; they make thebest soup in the world."

　　"Isn't it true, monsieur, that crows eat the dead?"

　　"You are a fool, Nanon. They eat what they can get, like the rest ofthe world. Don't we all live on the dead? What are legacies?"Monsieur Grandet, having no further orders to give, drew out hiswatch, and seeing that he had half an hour to dispose of beforebreakfast, he took his hat, went and kissed his daughter, and said toher:

　　"Do you want to come for a walk in the fields, down by the Loire? Ihave something to do there."

　　Eugenie fetched her straw bonnet, lined with pink taffeta; then thefather and daughter went down the winding street to the shore."Where are you going at this early hour?" said Cruchot, the notary,meeting them.

　　"To see something," answered Grandet, not duped by the matutinalappearance of his friend.

　　When Pere Grandet went to "see something," the notary knew byexperience there was something to be got by going with him; so hewent.

　　"Come, Cruchot," said Grandet, "you are one of my friends. I'll showyou what folly it is to plant poplar-trees on good ground.""Do you call the sixty thousand francs that you pocketed for thosethat were in your fields down by the Loire, folly?" said MaitreCruchot, opening his eyes with amazement. "What luck you have had! Tocut down your trees at the very time they ran short of white-wood atNantes, and to sell them at thirty francs!"

　　Eugenie listened, without knowing that she approached the most solemnmoment of her whole life, and that the notary was about to bring downupon her head a paternal and supreme sentence. Grandet had now reachedthe magnificent fields which he owned on the banks of the Loire, wherethirty workmen were employed in clearing away, filling up, andlevelling the spots formerly occupied by the poplars.

　　"Maitre Cruchot, see how much ground this tree once took up! Jean," hecried to a laborer, "m-m-measure with your r-r-rule, b-both ways.""Four times eight feet," said the man.

　　"Thirty-two feet lost," said Grandet to Cruchot. "I had three hundredpoplars in this one line, isn't that so? Well, then, three h-h-hundredtimes thir-thirty-two lost m-m-me five hundred in h-h-hay; add twiceas much for the side rows,--fifteen hundred; the middle rows as muchmore. So we may c-c-call it a th-thousand b-b-bales of h-h-hay--""Very good," said Cruchot, to help out his friend; "a thousand balesare worth about six hundred francs."

　　"Say t-t-twelve hundred, be-c-cause there's three or four hundredfrancs on the second crop. Well, then, c-c-calculate that t-twelvethousand francs a year for f-f-forty years with interest c-c-comesto--"

　　"Say sixty thousand francs," said the notary.

　　"I am willing; c-c-comes t-t-to sixty th-th-thousand. Very good,"continued Grandet, without stuttering: "two thousand poplars fortyyears old will only yield me fifty thousand francs. There's a loss. Ihave found that myself," said Grandet, getting on his high horse."Jean, fill up all the holes except those at the bank of the river;there you are to plant the poplars I have bought. Plant 'em there, andthey'll get nourishment from the government," he said, turning toCruchot, and giving a slight motion to the wen on his nose, whichexpressed more than the most ironical of smiles.

　　"True enough; poplars should only be planted on poor soil," saidCruchot, amazed at Grandet's calculations.

　　"Y-y-yes, monsieur," answered the old man satirically.

　　Eugenie, who was gazing at the sublime scenery of the Loire, andpaying no attention to her father's reckonings, presently turned anear to the remarks of Cruchot when she heard him say,--

　　"So you have brought a son-in-law from Paris. All Saumur is talkingabout your nephew. I shall soon have the marriage-contract to draw up,hey! Pere Grandet?"

　　"You g-g-got up very early to t-t-tell me that," said Grandet,accompanying the remark with a motion of his wen. "Well, oldc-c-comrade, I'll be frank, and t-t-tell you what you want t-t-toknow. I would rather, do you see, f-f-fling my daughter into the Loirethan g-g-give her to her c-c-cousin. You may t-t-tell that everywhere,--no, never mind; let the world t-t-talk."

　　This answer dazzled and blinded the young girl with sudden light. Thedistant hopes upspringing in her heart bloomed suddenly, became real,tangible, like a cluster of flowers, and she saw them cut down andwilting on the earth. Since the previous evening she had attachedherself to Charles by those links of happiness which bind soul tosoul; from henceforth suffering was to rivet them. Is it not the nobledestiny of women to be more moved by the dark solemnities of griefthan by the splendors of fortune? How was it that fatherly feeling haddied out of her father's heart? Of what crime had Charles been guilty?Mysterious questions! Already her dawning love, a mystery so profound,was wrapping itself in mystery. She walked back trembling in all herlimbs; and when she reached the gloomy street, lately so joyous toher, she felt its sadness, she breathed the melancholy which time andevents had printed there. None of love's lessons lacked. A few stepsfrom their own door she went on before her father and waited at thethreshold. But Grandet, who saw a newspaper in the notary's hand,stopped short and asked,--

　　"How are the Funds?"

　　"You never listen to my advice, Grandet," answered Cruchot. "Buy soon;you will still make twenty per cent in two years, besides getting anexcellent rate of interest,--five thousand a year for eighty thousandfrancs fifty centimes."

　　"We'll see about that," answered Grandet, rubbing his chin."Good God!" exclaimed the notary.

　　"Well, what?" cried Grandet; and at the same moment Cruchot put thenewspaper under his eyes and said:

　　"Read that!"

　　"Monsieur Grandet, one of the most respected merchants in Paris,

　　blew his brains out yesterday, after making his usual appearance

　　at the Bourse. He had sent his resignation to the president of the

　　Chamber of Deputies, and had also resigned his functions as a

　　judge of the commercial courts. The failures of Monsieur Roguin

　　and Monsieur Souchet, his broker and his notary, had ruined him.

　　The esteem felt for Monsieur Grandet and the credit he enjoyed

　　were nevertheless such that he might have obtained the necessary

　　assistance from other business houses. It is much to be regretted

　　that so honorable a man should have yielded to momentary despair,"

　　etc.

　　"I knew it," said the old wine-grower to the notary.

　　The words sent a chill of horror through Maitre Cruchot, who,notwithstanding his impassibility as a notary, felt the cold runningdown his spine as he thought that Grandet of Paris had possiblyimplored in vain the millions of Grandet of Saumur.

　　"And his son, so joyous yesterday--"

　　"He knows nothing as yet," answered Grandet, with the same composure."Adieu! Monsieur Grandet," said Cruchot, who now understood the stateof the case, and went off to reassure Monsieur de Bonfons.On entering, Grandet found breakfast ready. Madame Grandet, roundwhose neck Eugenie had flung her arms, kissing her with the quickeffusion of feeling often caused by secret grief, was already seatedin her chair on castors, knitting sleeves for the coming winter."You can begin to eat," said Nanon, coming downstairs four steps at atime; "the young one is sleeping like a cherub. Isn't he a darlingwith his eyes shut? I went in and I called him: no answer.""Let him sleep," said Grandet; "he'll wake soon enough to hear ill-tidings."

　　"What is it?" asked Eugenie, putting into her coffee the two littlebits of sugar weighing less than half an ounce which the old miseramused himself by cutting up in his leisure hours. Madame Grandet, whodid not dare to put the question, gazed at her husband.

　　"His father has blown his brains out."

　　"My uncle?" said Eugenie.

　　"Poor young man!" exclaimed Madame Grandet.

　　"Poor indeed!" said Grandet; "he isn't worth a sou!"

　　"Eh! poor boy, and he's sleeping like the king of the world!" saidNanon in a gentle voice.

　　Eugenie stopped eating. Her heart was wrung, as the young heart iswrung when pity for the suffering of one she loves overflows, for thefirst time, the whole being of a woman. The poor girl wept."What are you crying about? You didn't know your uncle," said herfather, giving her one of those hungry tigerish looks he doubtlessthrew upon his piles of gold.

　　"But, monsieur," said Nanon, "who wouldn't feel pity for the pooryoung man, sleeping there like a wooden shoe, without knowing what'scoming?"

　　"I didn't speak to you, Nanon. Hold your tongue!"

　　Eugenie learned at that moment that the woman who loves must be ableto hide her feelings. She did not answer.

　　"You will say nothing to him about it, Ma'ame Grandet, till I return,"said the old man. "I have to go and straighten the line of my hedgealong the high-road. I shall be back at noon, in time for the secondbreakfast, and then I will talk with my nephew about his affairs. Asfor you, Mademoiselle Eugenie, if it is for that dandy you are crying,that's enough, child. He's going off like a shot to the Indies. Youwill never see him again."

　　The father took his gloves from the brim of his hat, put them on withhis usual composure, pushed them in place by shoving the fingers ofboth hands together, and went out.

　　"Mamma, I am suffocating!" cried Eugenie when she was alone with hermother; "I have never suffered like this."

　　Madame Grandet, seeing that she turned pale, opened the window and lether breathe fresh air.

　　"I feel better!" said Eugenie after a moment.

　　This nervous excitement in a nature hitherto, to all appearance, calmand cold, reacted on Madame Grandet; she looked at her daughter withthe sympathetic intuition with which mothers are gifted for theobjects of their tenderness, and guessed all. In truth the life of theHungarian sisters, bound together by a freak of nature, could scarcelyhave been more intimate than that of Eugenie and her mother,--alwaystogether in the embrasure of that window, and sleeping together in thesame atmosphere.

　　"My poor child!" said Madame Grandet, taking Eugenie's head and layingit upon her bosom.

　　At these words the young girl raised her head, questioned her motherby a look, and seemed to search out her inmost thought.

　　"Why send him to the Indies?" she said. "If he is unhappy, ought henot to stay with us? Is he not our nearest relation?"

　　"Yes, my child, it seems natural; but your father has his reasons: wemust respect them."

　　The mother and daughter sat down in silence, the former upon herraised seat, the latter in her little armchair, and both took up theirwork. Swelling with gratitude for the full heart-understanding hermother had given her, Eugenie kissed the dear hand, saying,--"How good you are, my kind mamma!"

　　The words sent a glow of light into the motherly face, worn andblighted as it was by many sorrows.

　　"You like him?" asked Eugenie.

　　Madame Grandet only smiled in reply. Then, after a moment's silence,she said in a low voice: "Do you love him already? That is wrong.""Wrong?" said Eugenie. "Why is it wrong? You are pleased with him,Nanon is pleased with him; why should he not please me? Come, mamma,let us set the table for his breakfast."

　　She threw down her work, and her mother did the same, saying, "Foolishchild!" But she sanctioned the child's folly by sharing it. Eugeniecalled Nanon.

　　"What do you want now, mademoiselle?"

　　"Nanon, can we have cream by midday?"

　　"Ah! midday, to be sure you can," answered the old servant."Well, let him have his coffee very strong; I heard Monsieur desGrassins say that they make the coffee very strong in Paris. Put in agreat deal."

　　"Where am I to get it?"

　　"Buy some."

　　"Suppose monsieur meets me?"

　　"He has gone to his fields."

　　"I'll run, then. But Monsieur Fessard asked me yesterday if the Magihad come to stay with us when I bought the wax candle. All the townwill know our goings-on."

　　"If your father finds it out," said Madame Grandet, "he is capable ofbeating us."

　　"Well, let him beat us; we will take his blows on our knees."Madame Grandet for all answer raised her eyes to heaven. Nanon put onher hood and went off. Eugenie got out some clean table-linen, andwent to fetch a few bunches of grapes which she had amused herself byhanging on a string across the attic; she walked softly along thecorridor, so as not to waken her cousin, and she could not helplistening at the door to his quiet breathing.

　　"Sorrow is watching while he sleeps," she thought.

　　She took the freshest vine-leaves and arranged her dish of grapes ascoquettishly as a practised house-keeper might have done, and placedit triumphantly on the table. She laid hands on the pears counted outby her father, and piled them in a pyramid mixed with leaves. She wentand came, and skipped and ran. She would have liked to lay undercontribution everything in her father's house; but the keys were inhis pocket. Nanon came back with two fresh eggs. At sight of themEugenie almost hugged her round the neck.

　　"The farmer from Lande had them in his basket. I asked him for them,and he gave them to me, the darling, for nothing, as an attention!"VAfter two hours' thought and care, during which Eugenie jumped uptwenty times from her work to see if the coffee were boiling, or to goand listen to the noise her cousin made in dressing, she succeeded inpreparing a simple little breakfast, very inexpensive, but which,nevertheless, departed alarmingly from the inveterate customs of thehouse. The midday breakfast was always taken standing. Each took aslice of bread, a little fruit or some butter, and a glass of wine. AsEugenie looked at the table drawn up near the fire with an arm-chairplaced before her cousin's plate, at the two dishes of fruit, the egg-cup, the bottle of white wine, the bread, and the sugar heaped up in asaucer, she trembled in all her limbs at the mere thought of the lookher father would give her if he should come in at that moment. Sheglanced often at the clock to see if her cousin could breakfast beforethe master's return.

　　"Don't be troubled, Eugenie; if your father comes in, I will take itall upon myself," said Madame Grandet.

　　Eugenie could not repress a tear.

　　"Oh, my good mother!" she cried, "I have never loved you enough."Charles, who had been tramping about his room for some time, singingto himself, now came down. Happily, it was only eleven o'clock. Thetrue Parisian! he had put as much dandyism into his dress as if hewere in the chateau of the noble lady then travelling in Scotland. Hecame into the room with the smiling, courteous manner so becoming toyouth, which made Eugenie's heart beat with mournful joy. He had takenthe destruction of his castles in Anjou as a joke, and came up to hisaunt gaily.

　　"Have you slept well, dear aunt? and you, too, my cousin?""Very well, monsieur; did you?" said Madame Grandet.

　　"I? perfectly."

　　"You must be hungry, cousin," said Eugenie; "will you take your seat?""I never breakfast before midday; I never get up till then. However, Ifared so badly on the journey that I am glad to eat something at once.Besides--" here he pulled out the prettiest watch Breguet ever made."Dear me! I am early, it is only eleven o'clock!"

　　"Early?" said Madame Grandet.

　　"Yes; but I wanted to put my things in order. Well, I shall be glad tohave anything to eat,--anything, it doesn't matter what, a chicken, apartridge."

　　"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed Nanon, overhearing the words.

　　"A partridge!" whispered Eugenie to herself; she would gladly havegiven the whole of her little hoard for a partridge.

　　"Come and sit down," said his aunt.

　　The young dandy let himself drop into an easy-chair, just as a prettywoman falls gracefully upon a sofa. Eugenie and her mother tookordinary chairs and sat beside him, near the fire.

　　"Do you always live here?" said Charles, thinking the room uglier bydaylight than it had seemed the night before.

　　"Always," answered Eugenie, looking at him, "except during thevintage. Then we go and help Nanon, and live at the Abbaye desNoyers."

　　"Don't you ever take walks?"

　　"Sometimes on Sunday after vespers, when the weather is fine," saidMadame Grandet, "we walk on the bridge, or we go and watch thehaymakers."

　　"Have you a theatre?"

　　"Go to the theatre!" exclaimed Madame Grandet, "see a play! Why,monsieur, don't you know it is a mortal sin?"

　　"See here, monsieur," said Nanon, bringing in the eggs, "here are yourchickens,--in the shell."

　　"Oh! fresh eggs," said Charles, who, like all people accustomed toluxury, had already forgotten about his partridge, "that is delicious:now, if you will give me the butter, my good girl."

　　"Butter! then you can't have the /galette/."

　　"Nanon, bring the butter," cried Eugenie.

　　The young girl watched her cousin as he cut his sippets, with as muchpleasure as a grisette takes in a melodrama where innocence and virtuetriumph. Charles, brought up by a charming mother, improved, andtrained by a woman of fashion, had the elegant, dainty, foppishmovements of a coxcomb. The compassionate sympathy and tenderness of ayoung girl possess a power that is actually magnetic; so that Charles,finding himself the object of the attentions of his aunt and cousin,could not escape the influence of feelings which flowed towards him,as it were, and inundated him. He gave Eugenie a bright, caressinglook full of kindness,--a look which seemed itself a smile. Heperceived, as his eyes lingered upon her, the exquisite harmony offeatures in the pure face, the grace of her innocent attitude, themagic clearness of the eyes, where young love sparkled and desireshone unconsciously.

　　"Ah! my dear cousin, if you were in full dress at the Opera, I assureyou my aunt's words would come true,--you would make the men committhe mortal sin of envy, and the women the sin of jealousy."The compliment went to Eugenie's heart and set it beating, though shedid not understand its meaning.

　　"Oh! cousin," she said, "you are laughing at a poor little countrygirl."

　　"If you knew me, my cousin, you would know that I abhor ridicule; itwithers the heart and jars upon all my feelings." Here he swallowedhis buttered sippet very gracefully. "No, I really have not enoughmind to make fun of others; and doubtless it is a great defect. InParis, when they want to disparage a man, they say: 'He has a goodheart.' The phrase means: 'The poor fellow is as stupid as arhinoceros.' But as I am rich, and known to hit the bull's-eye atthirty paces with any kind of pistol, and even in the open fields,ridicule respects me."

　　"My dear nephew, that bespeaks a good heart."

　　"You have a very pretty ring," said Eugenie; "is there any harm inasking to see it?"

　　Charles held out his hand after loosening the ring, and Eugenieblushed as she touched the pink nails of her cousin with the tips ofher fingers.

　　"See, mamma, what beautiful workmanship."

　　"My! there's a lot of gold!" said Nanon, bringing in the coffee."What is that?" exclaimed Charles, laughing, as he pointed to anoblong pot of brown earthenware, glazed on the inside, and edged witha fringe of ashes, from the bottom of which the coffee-grounds werebubbling up and falling in the boiling liquid.

　　"It is boiled coffee," said Nanon.

　　"Ah! my dear aunt, I shall at least leave one beneficent trace of myvisit here. You are indeed behind the age! I must teach you to makegood coffee in a Chaptal coffee-pot."

　　He tried to explain the process of a Chaptal coffee-pot.

　　"Gracious! if there are so many things as all that to do," said Nanon,"we may as well give up our lives to it. I shall never make coffeethat way; I know that! Pray, who is to get the fodder for the cowwhile I make the coffee?"

　　"I will make it," said Eugenie.

　　"Child!" said Madame Grandet, looking at her daughter.

　　The word recalled to their minds the sorrow that was about to fallupon the unfortunate young man; the three women were silent, andlooked at him with an air of commiseration that caught his attention."Is anything the matter, my cousin?" he said.

　　"Hush!" said Madame Grandet to Eugenie, who was about to answer; "youknow, my daughter, that your father charged us not to speak tomonsieur--"

　　"Say Charles," said young Grandet.

　　"Ah! you are called Charles? What a beautiful name!" cried Eugenie.Presentiments of evil are almost always justified. At this momentNanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie, who had all three been thinkingwith a shudder of the old man's return, heard the knock whose echoesthey knew but too well.

　　"There's papa!" said Eugenie.

　　She removed the saucer filled with sugar, leaving a few pieces on thetable-cloth; Nanon carried off the egg-cup; Madame Grandet sat up likea frightened hare. It was evidently a panic, which amazed Charles, whowas wholly unable to understand it.

　　"Why! what is the matter?" he asked.

　　"My father has come," answered Eugenie.

　　"Well, what of that?"

　　Monsieur Grandet entered the room, threw his keen eye upon the table,upon Charles, and saw the whole thing.

　　"Ha! ha! so you have been making a feast for your nephew; very good,very good, very good indeed!" he said, without stuttering. "When thecat's away, the mice will play."

　　"Feast!" thought Charles, incapable of suspecting or imagining therules and customs of the household.

　　"Give me my glass, Nanon," said the master

　　Eugenie brought the glass. Grandet drew a horn-handled knife with abig blade from his breeches' pocket, cut a slice of bread, took asmall bit of butter, spread it carefully on the bread, and ate itstanding. At this moment Charlie was sweetening his coffee. PereGrandet saw the bits of sugar, looked at his wife, who turned pale,and made three steps forward; he leaned down to the poor woman's earand said,--

　　"Where did you get all that sugar?"

　　"Nanon fetched it from Fessard's; there was none."

　　It is impossible to picture the profound interest the three women tookin this mute scene. Nanon had left her kitchen and stood looking intothe room to see what would happen. Charles, having tasted his coffee,found it bitter and glanced about for the sugar, which Grandet hadalready put away.

　　"What do you want?" said his uncle.

　　"The sugar."

　　"Put in more milk," answered the master of the house; "your coffeewill taste sweeter."

　　Eugenie took the saucer which Grandet had put away and placed it onthe table, looking calmly at her father as she did so. Most assuredly,the Parisian woman who held a silken ladder with her feeble arms tofacilitate the flight of her lover, showed no greater courage thanEugenie displayed when she replaced the sugar upon the table. Thelover rewarded his mistress when she proudly showed him her beautifulbruised arm, and bathed every swollen vein with tears and kisses tillit was cured with happiness. Charles, on the other hand, never so muchas knew the secret of the cruel agitation that shook and bruised theheart of his cousin, crushed as it was by the look of the old miser."You are not eating your breakfast, wife."

　　The poor helot came forward with a piteous look, cut herself a pieceof bread, and took a pear. Eugenie boldly offered her father somegrapes, saying,--

　　"Taste my preserves, papa. My cousin, you will eat some, will you not?I went to get these pretty grapes expressly for you."

　　"If no one stops them, they will pillage Saumur for you, nephew. Whenyou have finished, we will go into the garden; I have something totell you which can't be sweetened."

　　Eugenie and her mother cast a look on Charles whose meaning the youngman could not mistake.

　　"What is it you mean, uncle? Since the death of my poor mother"--atthese words his voice softened--"no other sorrow can touch me.""My nephew, who knows by what afflictions God is pleased to try us?"said his aunt.

　　"Ta, ta, ta, ta," said Grandet, "there's your nonsense beginning. I amsorry to see those white hands of yours, nephew"; and he showed theshoulder-of-mutton fists which Nature had put at the end of his ownarms. "There's a pair of hands made to pick up silver pieces. You'vebeen brought up to put your feet in the kid out of which we make thepurses we keep our money in. A bad look-out! Very bad!"

　　"What do you mean, uncle? I'll be hanged if I understand a single wordof what you are saying."

　　"Come!" said Grandet.

　　The miser closed the blade of his knife with a snap, drank the last ofhis wine, and opened the door.

　　"My cousin, take courage!"

　　The tone of the young girl struck terror to Charles's heart, and hefollowed his terrible uncle, a prey to disquieting thoughts. Eugenie,her mother, and Nanon went into the kitchen, moved by irresistiblecuriosity to watch the two actors in the scene which was about to takeplace in the garden, where at first the uncle walked silently ahead ofthe nephew. Grandet was not at all troubled at having to tell Charlesof the death of his father; but he did feel a sort of compassion inknowing him to be without a penny, and he sought for some phrase orformula by which to soften the communication of that cruel truth. "Youhave lost your father," seemed to him a mere nothing to say; fathersdie before their children. But "you are absolutely without means,"--all the misfortunes of life were summed up in those words! Grandetwalked round the garden three times, the gravel crunching under hisheavy step.

　　In the crucial moments of life our minds fasten upon the localitywhere joys or sorrows overwhelm us. Charles noticed with minuteattention the box-borders of the little garden, the yellow leaves asthey fluttered down, the dilapidated walls, the gnarled fruit-trees,--picturesque details which were destined to remain forever in hismemory, blending eternally, by the mnemonics that belong exclusivelyto the passions, with the recollections of this solemn hour."It is very fine weather, very warm," said Grandet, drawing a longbreath.

　　"Yes, uncle; but why--"

　　"Well, my lad," answered his uncle, "I have some bad news to give you.Your father is ill--"

　　"Then why am I here?" said Charles. "Nanon," he cried, "order post-horses! I can get a carriage somewhere?" he added, turning to hisuncle, who stood motionless.

　　"Horses and carriages are useless," answered Grandet, looking atCharles, who remained silent, his eyes growing fixed. "Yes, my poorboy, you guess the truth,--he is dead. But that's nothing; there issomething worse: he blew out his brains."

　　"My father!"

　　"Yes, but that's not the worst; the newspapers are all talking aboutit. Here, read that."

　　Grandet, who had borrowed the fatal article from Cruchot, thrust thepaper under his nephew's eyes. The poor young man, still a child,still at an age when feelings wear no mask, burst into tears."That's good!" thought Grandet; "his eyes frightened me. He'll be allright if he weeps,--That is not the worst, my poor nephew," he saidaloud, not noticing whether Charles heard him, "that is nothing; youwill get over it: but--"

　　"Never, never! My father! Oh, my father!"

　　"He has ruined you, you haven't a penny."

　　"What does that matter? My father! Where is my father?"

　　His sobs resounded horribly against those dreary walls andreverberated in the echoes. The three women, filled with pity, weptalso; for tears are often as contagious as laughter. Charles, withoutlistening further to his uncle, ran through the court and up thestaircase to his chamber, where he threw himself across the bed andhid his face in the sheets, to weep in peace for his lost parents."The first burst must have its way," said Grandet, entering theliving-room, where Eugenie and her mother had hastily resumed theirseats and were sewing with trembling hands, after wiping their eyes."But that young man is good for nothing; his head is more taken upwith the dead than with his money."

　　Eugenie shuddered as she heard her father's comment on the most sacredof all griefs. From that moment she began to judge him. Charles'ssobs, though muffled, still sounded through the sepulchral house; andhis deep groans, which seemed to come from the earth beneath, onlyceased towards evening, after growing gradually feebler.

　　"Poor young man!" said Madame Grandet.

　　Fatal exclamation! Pere Grandet looked at his wife, at Eugenie, and atthe sugar-bowl. He recollected the extraordinary breakfast preparedfor the unfortunate youth, and he took a position in the middle of theroom.

　　"Listen to me," he said, with his usual composure. "I hope that youwill not continue this extravagance, Madame Grandet. I don't give youMY money to stuff that young fellow with sugar."

　　"My mother had nothing to do with it," said Eugenie; "it was I who--""Is it because you are of age," said Grandet, interrupting hisdaughter, "that you choose to contradict me? Remember, Eugenie--""Father, the son of your brother ought to receive from us--""Ta, ta, ta, ta!" exclaimed the cooper on four chromatic tones; "theson of my brother this, my nephew that! Charles is nothing at all tous; he hasn't a farthing, his father has failed; and when this dandyhas cried his fill, off he goes from here. I won't have himrevolutionize my household."

　　"What is 'failing,' father?" asked Eugenie.

　　"To fail," answered her father, "is to commit the most dishonorableaction that can disgrace a man."

　　"It must be a great sin," said Madame Grandet, "and our brother may bedamned."

　　"There, there, don't begin with your litanies!" said Grandet,shrugging his shoulders. "To fail, Eugenie," he resumed, "is to commita theft which the law, unfortunately, takes under its protection.People have given their property to Guillaume Grandet trusting to hisreputation for honor and integrity; he has made away with it all, andleft them nothing but their eyes to weep with. A highway robber isbetter than a bankrupt: the one attacks you and you can defendyourself, he risks his own life; but the other--in short, Charles isdishonored."

　　The words rang in the poor girl's heart and weighed it down with theirheavy meaning. Upright and delicate as a flower born in the depths ofa forest, she knew nothing of the world's maxims, of its deceitfularguments and specious sophisms; she therefore believed the atrociousexplanation which her father gave her designedly, concealing thedistinction which exists between an involuntary failure and anintentional one.

　　"Father, could you not have prevented such a misfortune?""My brother did not consult me. Besides, he owes four millions.""What is a 'million,' father?" she asked, with the simplicity of achild which thinks it can find out at once all that it wants to know."A million?" said Grandet, "why, it is a million pieces of twenty souseach, and it takes five twenty sous pieces to make five francs.""Dear me!" cried Eugenie, "how could my uncle possibly have had fourmillions? Is there any one else in France who ever had so manymillions?" Pere Grandet stroked his chin, smiled, and his wen seemedto dilate. "But what will become of my cousin Charles?"

　　"He is going off to the West Indies by his father's request, and hewill try to make his fortune there."

　　"Has he got the money to go with?"

　　"I shall pay for his journey as far as--yes, as far as Nantes."Eugenie sprang into his arms.

　　"Oh, father, how good you are!"

　　She kissed him with a warmth that almost made Grandet ashamed ofhimself, for his conscience galled him a little.

　　"Will it take much time to amass a million?" she asked.

　　"Look here!" said the old miser, "you know what a napoleon is? Well,it takes fifty thousand napoleons to make a million."

　　"Mamma, we must say a great many /neuvaines/ for him."

　　"I was thinking so," said Madame Grandet.

　　"That's the way, always spending my money!" cried the father. "Do youthink there are francs on every bush?"

　　At this moment a muffled cry, more distressing than all the others,echoed through the garrets and struck a chill to the hearts of Eugenieand her mother.

　　"Nanon, go upstairs and see that he does not kill himself," saidGrandet. "Now, then," he added, looking at his wife and daughter, whohad turned pale at his words, "no nonsense, you two! I must leave you;I have got to see about the Dutchmen who are going away to-day. Andthen I must find Cruchot, and talk with him about all this."He departed. As soon as he had shut the door Eugenie and her motherbreathed more freely. Until this morning the young girl had never feltconstrained in the presence of her father; but for the last few hoursevery moment wrought a change in her feelings and ideas.

　　"Mamma, how many louis are there in a cask of wine?"

　　"Your father sells his from a hundred to a hundred and fifty francs,sometimes two hundred,--at least, so I've heard say."

　　"Then papa must be rich?"

　　"Perhaps he is. But Monsieur Cruchot told me he bought Froidfond twoyears ago; that may have pinched him."

　　Eugenie, not being able to understand the question of her father'sfortune, stopped short in her calculations.

　　"He didn't even see me, the darling!" said Nanon, coming back from hererrand. "He's stretched out like a calf on his bed and crying like theMadeleine, and that's a blessing! What's the matter with the poor dearyoung man!"

　　"Let us go and console him, mamma; if any one knocks, we can comedown."

　　Madame Grandet was helpless against the sweet persuasive tones of herdaughter's voice. Eugenie was sublime: she had become a woman. Thetwo, with beating hearts, went up to Charles's room. The door wasopen. The young man heard and saw nothing; plunged in grief, he onlyuttered inarticulate cries.

　　"How he loves his father!" said Eugenie in a low voice.

　　In the utterance of those words it was impossible to mistake the hopesof a heart that, unknown to itself, had suddenly become passionate.Madame Grandet cast a mother's look upon her daughter, and thenwhispered in her ear,--

　　"Take care, you will love him!"

　　"Love him!" answered Eugenie. "Ah! if you did but know what my fathersaid to Monsieur Cruchot."

　　Charles turned over, and saw his aunt and cousin.

　　"I have lost my father, my poor father! If he had told me his secrettroubles we might have worked together to repair them. My God! my poorfather! I was so sure I should see him again that I think I kissed himquite coldly--"

　　Sobs cut short the words.

　　"We will pray for him," said Madame Grandet. "Resign yourself to thewill of God."

　　"Cousin," said Eugenie, "take courage! Your loss is irreparable;therefore think only of saving your honor."

　　With the delicate instinct of a woman who intuitively puts her mindinto all things, even at the moment when she offers consolation,Eugenie sought to cheat her cousin's grief by turning his thoughtsinward upon himself.

　　"My honor?" exclaimed the young man, tossing aside his hair with animpatient gesture as he sat up on his bed and crossed his arms. "Ah!that is true. My uncle said my father had failed." He uttered a heart-rending cry, and hid his face in his hands. "Leave me, leave me,cousin! My God! my God! forgive my father, for he must have sufferedsorely!"

　　There was something terribly attractive in the sight of this youngsorrow, sincere without reasoning or afterthought. It was a virgingrief which the simple hearts of Eugenie and her mother were fitted tocomprehend, and they obeyed the sign Charles made them to leave him tohimself. They went downstairs in silence and took their accustomedplaces by the window and sewed for nearly an hour without exchanging aword. Eugenie had seen in the furtive glance that she cast about theyoung man's room--that girlish glance which sees all in the twinklingof an eye--the pretty trifles of his dressing-case, his scissors, hisrazors embossed with gold. This gleam of luxury across her cousin'sgrief only made him the more interesting to her, possibly by way ofcontrast. Never before had so serious an event, so dramatic a sight,touched the imaginations of these two passive beings, hitherto sunk inthe stillness and calm of solitude.

　　"Mamma," said Eugenie, "we must wear mourning for my uncle.""Your father will decide that," answered Madame Grandet.

　　They relapsed into silence. Eugenie drew her stitches with a uniformmotion which revealed to an observer the teeming thoughts of hermeditation. The first desire of the girl's heart was to share hercousin's mourning.

　　VI

　　About four o'clock an abrupt knock at the door struck sharply on theheart of Madame Grandet.

　　"What can have happened to your father?" she said to her daughter.Grandet entered joyously. After taking off his gloves, he rubbed hishands hard enough to take off their skin as well, if his epidermis hadnot been tanned and cured like Russia leather,--saving, of course, theperfume of larch-trees and incense. Presently his secret escaped him."Wife," he said, without stuttering, "I've trapped them all! Our wineis sold! The Dutch and the Belgians have gone. I walked about themarket-place in front of their inn, pretending to be doing nothing.That Belgian fellow--you know who I mean--came up to me. The owners ofall the good vineyards have kept back their vintages, intending towait; well, I didn't hinder them. The Belgian was in despair; I sawthat. In a minute the bargain was made. He takes my vintage at twohundred francs the puncheon, half down. He paid me in gold; the notesare drawn. Here are six louis for you. In three months wines will havefallen."

　　These words, uttered in a quiet tone of voice, were nevertheless sobitterly sarcastic that the inhabitants of Saumur, grouped at thismoment in the market-place and overwhelmed by the news of the saleGrandet had just effected, would have shuddered had they heard them.Their panic would have brought the price of wines down fifty per centat once.

　　"Did you have a thousand puncheons this year, father?"

　　"Yes, little one."

　　That term applied to his daughter was the superlative expression ofthe old miser's joy.

　　"Then that makes two hundred thousand pieces of twenty sous each?""Yes, Mademoiselle Grandet."

　　"Then, father, you can easily help Charles."

　　The amazement, the anger, the stupefaction of Belshazzar when he sawthe /Mene-Tekel-Upharsin/ before his eyes is not to be compared withthe cold rage of Grandet, who, having forgotten his nephew, now foundhim enshrined in the heart and calculations of his daughter."What's this? Ever since that dandy put foot in MY house everythinggoes wrong! You behave as if you had the right to buy sugar-plums andmake feasts and weddings. I won't have that sort of thing. I hope Iknow my duty at my time of life! I certainly sha'n't take lessons frommy daughter, or from anybody else. I shall do for my nephew what it isproper to do, and you have no need to poke your nose into it. As foryou, Eugenie," he added, facing her, "don't speak of this again, orI'll send you to the Abbaye des Noyers with Nanon, see if I don't; andno later than to-morrow either, if you disobey me! Where is thatfellow, has he come down yet?"

　　"No, my friend," answered Madame Grandet.

　　"What is he doing then?"

　　"He is weeping for his father," said Eugenie.

　　Grandet looked at his daughter without finding a word to say; afterall, he was a father. He made a couple of turns up and down the room,and then went hurriedly to his secret den to think over an investmenthe was meditating in the public Funds. The thinning out of his twothousand acres of forest land had yielded him six hundred thousandfrancs: putting this sum to that derived from the sale of his poplarsand to his other gains for the last year and for the current year, hehad amassed a total of nine hundred thousand francs, without countingthe two hundred thousand he had got by the sale just concluded. Thetwenty per cent which Cruchot assured him would gain in a short timefrom the Funds, then quoted at seventy, tempted him. He figured outhis calculation on the margin of the newspaper which gave the accountof his brother's death, all the while hearing the moans of his nephew,but without listening to them. Nanon came and knocked on the wall tosummon him to dinner. On the last step of the staircase he was sayingto himself as he came down,--

　　"I'll do it; I shall get eight per cent interest. In two years I shallhave fifteen hundred thousand francs, which I will then draw out ingood gold,--Well, where's my nephew?"

　　"He says he doesn't want anything to eat," answered Nanon; "that's notgood for him."

　　"So much saved," retorted her master.

　　"That's so," she said.

　　"Bah! he won't cry long. Hunger drives the wolves out of the woods."The dinner was eaten in silence.

　　"My good friend," said Madame Grandet, when the cloth was removed, "wemust put on mourning."

　　"Upon my word, Madame Grandet! what will you invent next to spendmoney on? Mourning is in the heart, and not in the clothes.""But mourning for a brother is indispensable; and the Church commandsus to--"

　　"Buy your mourning out of your six louis. Give me a hat-band; that'senough for me."

　　Eugenie raised her eyes to heaven without uttering a word. Hergenerous instincts, slumbering and long repressed but now suddenly andfor the first time awakened, were galled at every turn. The eveningpassed to all appearance like a thousand other evenings of theirmonotonous life, yet it was certainly the most horrible. Eugenie sewedwithout raising her head, and did not use the workbox which Charleshad despised the night before. Madame Grandet knitted her sleeves.Grandet twirled his thumbs for four hours, absorbed in calculationswhose results were on the morrow to astonish Saumur. No one came tovisit the family that day. The whole town was ringing with the news ofthe business trick just played by Grandet, the failure of his brother,and the arrival of his nephew. Obeying the desire to gossip over theirmutual interests, all the upper and middle-class wine-growers inSaumur met at Monsieur des Grassins, where terrible imprecations werebeing fulminated against the ex-mayor. Nanon was spinning, and thewhirr of her wheel was the only sound heard beneath the gray raftersof that silent hall.

　　"We don't waste our tongues," she said, showing her teeth, as largeand white as peeled almonds.

　　"Nothing should be wasted," answered Grandet, rousing himself from hisreverie. He saw a perspective of eight millions in three years, and hewas sailing along that sheet of gold. "Let us go to bed. I will bid mynephew good-night for the rest of you, and see if he will takeanything."

　　Madame Grandet remained on the landing of the first storey to hear theconversation that was about to take place between the goodman and hisnephew. Eugenie, bolder than her mother, went up two stairs."Well, nephew, you are in trouble. Yes, weep, that's natural. A fatheris a father; but we must bear our troubles patiently. I am a gooduncle to you, remember that. Come, take courage! Will you have alittle glass of wine?" (Wine costs nothing in Saumur, and they offerit as tea is offered in China.) "Why!" added Grandet, "you have got nolight! That's bad, very bad; you ought to see what you are about," andhe walked to the chimney-piece. "What's this?" he cried. "A waxcandle! How the devil did they filch a wax candle? The spendthriftswould tear down the ceilings of my house to boil the fellow's eggs."Hearing these words, mother and daughter slipped back into their roomsand burrowed in their beds, with the celerity of frightened micegetting back to their holes.

　　"Madame Grandet, have you found a mine?" said the man, coming into thechamber of his wife.

　　"My friend, wait; I am saying my prayers," said the poor mother in atrembling voice.

　　"The devil take your good God!" growled Grandet in reply.Misers have no belief in a future life; the present is their all inall. This thought casts a terrible light upon our present epoch, inwhich, far more than at any former period, money sways the laws andpolitics and morals.  Institutions, books, men, and dogmas, allconspire to undermine belief in a future life,--a belief upon whichthe social edifice has rested for eighteen hundred years. The grave,as a means of transition, is little feared in our day. The future,which once opened to us beyond the requiems, has now been importedinto the present. To obtain /per fas et nefas/ a terrestrial paradiseof luxury and earthly enjoyment, to harden the heart and macerate thebody for the sake of fleeting possessions, as the martyrs oncesuffered all things to reach eternal joys, this is now the universalthought--a thought written everywhere, even in the very laws which askof the legislator, "What do you pay?" instead of asking him, "What doyou think?" When this doctrine has passed down from the bourgeoisie tothe populace, where will this country be?

　　"Madame Grandet, have you done?" asked the old man.

　　"My friend, I am praying for you."

　　"Very good! Good-night; to-morrow morning we will have a talk."The poor woman went to sleep like a schoolboy who, not having learnedhis lessons, knows he will see his master's angry face on the morrow.At the moment when, filled with fear, she was drawing the sheet aboveher head that she might stifle hearing, Eugenie, in her night-gown andwith naked feet, ran to her side and kissed her brow.

　　"Oh! my good mother," she said, "to-morrow I will tell him it was I.""No; he would send you to Noyers. Leave me to manage it; he cannot eatme."

　　"Do you hear, mamma?"

　　"What?"

　　"/He/ is weeping still."

　　"Go to bed, my daughter; you will take cold in your feet: the floor isdamp."

　　*****

　　Thus passed the solemn day which was destined to weight upon the wholelife of the rich and poor heiress, whose sleep was never again to beso calm, nor yet so pure, as it had been up to this moment. It oftenhappens that certain actions of human life seem, literally speaking,improbable, though actual. Is not this because we constantly omit toturn the stream of psychological light upon our impulsivedeterminations, and fail to explain the subtile reasons, mysteriouslyconceived in our minds, which impelled them? Perhaps Eugenie's deeppassion should be analyzed in its most delicate fibres; for it became,scoffers might say, a malady which influenced her whole existence.Many people prefer to deny results rather than estimate the force ofties and links and bonds, which secretly join one fact to another inthe moral order. Here, therefore, Eugenie's past life will offer toobservers of human nature an explanation of her naive want ofreflection and the suddenness of the emotions which overflowed hersoul. The more tranquil her life had been, the more vivid was herwomanly pity, the more simple-minded were the sentiments now developedin her soul.

　　Made restless by the events of the day, she woke at intervals tolisten to her cousin, thinking she heard the sighs which still echoedin her heart. Sometimes she saw him dying of his trouble, sometimesshe dreamed that he fainted from hunger. Towards morning she wascertain that she heard a startling cry. She dressed at once and ran,in the dawning light, with a swift foot to her cousin's chamber, thedoor of which he had left open. The candle had burned down to thesocket. Charles, overcome by nature, was sleeping, dressed and sittingin an armchair beside the bed, on which his head rested; he dreamed asmen dream on an empty stomach. Eugenie might weep at her ease; shemight admire the young and handsome face blotted with grief, the eyesswollen with weeping, that seemed, sleeping as they were, to wellforth tears. Charles felt sympathetically the young girl's presence;he opened his eyes and saw her pitying him.

　　"Pardon me, my cousin," he said, evidently not knowing the hour northe place in which he found himself.

　　"There are hearts who hear you, cousin, and /we/ thought you mightneed something. You should go to bed; you tire yourself by sittingthus."

　　"That is true."

　　"Well, then, adieu!"

　　She escaped, ashamed and happy at having gone there. Innocence alonecan dare to be so bold. Once enlightened, virtue makes hercalculations as well as vice. Eugenie, who had not trembled beside hercousin, could scarcely stand upon her legs when she regained herchamber. Her ignorant life had suddenly come to an end; she reasoned,she rebuked herself with many reproaches.

　　"What will he think of me? He will think that I love him!"That was what she most wished him to think. An honest love has its ownprescience, and knows that love begets love. What an event for thispoor solitary girl thus to have entered the chamber of a young man!Are there not thoughts and actions in the life of love which tocertain souls bear the full meaning of the holiest espousals? An hourlater she went to her mother and dressed her as usual. Then they bothcame down and sat in their places before the window waiting forGrandet, with that cruel anxiety which, according to the individualcharacter, freezes the heart or warms it, shrivels or dilates it, whena scene is feared, a punishment expected,--a feeling so natural thateven domestic animals possess it, and whine at the slightest pain ofpunishment, though they make no outcry when they inadvertently hurtthemselves. The goodman came down; but he spoke to his wife with anabsent manner, kissed Eugenie, and sat down to table without appearingto remember his threats of the night before.

　　"What has become of my nephew? The lad gives no trouble.""Monsieur, he is asleep," answered Nanon.

　　"So much the better; he won't want a wax candle," said Grandet in ajeering tone.

　　This unusual clemency, this bitter gaiety, struck Madame Grandet withamazement, and she looked at her husband attentively. The goodman--here it may be well to explain that in Touraine, Anjou, Pitou, andBretagne the word "goodman," already used to designate Grandet, isbestowed as often upon harsh and cruel men as upon those of kindlytemperament, when either have reached a certain age; the title meansnothing on the score of individual gentleness--the goodman took hishat and gloves, saying as he went out,--

　　"I am going to loiter about the market-place and find Cruchot.""Eugenie, your father certainly has something on his mind."Grandet, who was a poor sleeper, employed half his nights in thepreliminary calculations which gave such astonishing accuracy to hisviews and observations and schemes, and secured to them the unfailingsuccess at sight of which his townsmen stood amazed. All human poweris a compound of time and patience. Powerful beings will and wait. Thelife of a miser is the constant exercise of human power put to theservice of self. It rests on two sentiments only,--self-love and self-interest; but self-interest being to a certain extent compact andintelligent self-love, the visible sign of real superiority, itfollows that self-love and self-interest are two parts of the samewhole,--egotism. From this arises, perhaps, the excessive curiosityshown in the habits of a miser's life whenever they are put before theworld. Every nature holds by a thread to those beings who challengeall human sentiments by concentrating all in one passion. Where is theman without desire? and what social desire can be satisfied withoutmoney?

　　Grandet unquestionably "had something on his mind," to use his wife'sexpression. There was in him, as in all misers, a persistent cravingto play a commercial game with other men and win their money legally.To impose upon other people was to him a sign of power, a perpetualproof that he had won the right to despise those feeble beings whosuffer themselves to be preyed upon in this world. Oh! who has evertruly understood the lamb lying peacefully at the feet of God?--touching emblem of all terrestrial victims, myth of their future,suffering and weakness glorified! This lamb it is which the miserfattens, puts in his fold, slaughters, cooks, eats, and then despises.The pasture of misers is compounded of money and disdain. During thenight Grandet's ideas had taken another course, which was the reasonof his sudden clemency. He had hatched a plot by which to trick theParisians, to decoy and dupe and snare them, to drive them into atrap, and make them go and come and sweat and hope and turn pale,--aplot by which to amuse himself, the old provincial cooper, sittingthere beneath his gloomy rafters, or passing up and down the rottenstaircase of his house in Saumur. His nephew filled his mind. Hewished to save the honor of his dead brother without the cost of apenny to the son or to himself. His own funds he was about to investfor three years; he had therefore nothing further to do than to managehis property in Saumur. He needed some nutriment for his maliciousactivity, and he found it suddenly in his brother's failure. Feelingnothing to squeeze between his own paws, he resolved to crush theParisians in behalf of Charles, and to play the part of a good brotheron the cheapest terms. The honor of the family counted for so littlein this scheme that his good intentions might be likened to theinterest a gambler takes in seeing a game well played in which he hasno stake. The Cruchots were a necessary part of his plan; but he wouldnot seek them,--he resolved to make them come to him, and to lead upthat very evening to a comedy whose plot he had just conceived, whichshould make him on the morrow an object of admiration to the wholetown without its costing him a single penny.

　　In her father's absence Eugenie had the happiness of busying herselfopenly with her much-loved cousin, of spending upon him fearlessly thetreasures of her pity,--woman's sublime superiority, the sole shedesires to have recognized, the sole she pardons man for letting herassume. Three or four times the young girl went to listen to hercousin's breathing, to know if he were sleeping or awake; then, whenhe had risen, she turned her thoughts to the cream, the eggs, thefruits, the plates, the glasses,--all that was a part of his breakfastbecame the object of some special care. At length she ran lightly upthe old staircase to listen to the noise her cousin made. Was hedressing? Did he still weep? She reached the door.

　　"My cousin!"

　　"Yes, cousin."

　　"Will you breakfast downstairs, or in your room?"

　　"Where you like."

　　"How do you feel?"

　　"Dear cousin, I am ashamed of being hungry."

　　This conversation, held through the closed door, was like an episodein a poem to Eugenie.

　　"Well, then, we will bring your breakfast to your own room, so as notto annoy my father."

　　She ran to the kitchen with the swiftness and lightness of a bird."Nanon, go and do his room!"

　　That staircase, so often traversed, which echoed to the slightestnoise, now lost its decaying aspect in the eyes of Eugenie. It grewluminous; it had a voice and spoke to her; it was young like herself,--young like the love it was now serving. Her mother, her kind,indulgent mother, lent herself to the caprices of the child's love,and after the room was put in order, both went to sit with the unhappyyouth and keep him company. Does not Christian charity makeconsolation a duty? The two women drew a goodly number of littlesophistries from their religion wherewith to justify their conduct.Charles was made the object of the tenderest and most loving care. Hissaddened heart felt the sweetness of the gentle friendship, theexquisite sympathy which these two souls, crushed under perpetualrestraint, knew so well how to display when, for an instant, they wereleft unfettered in the regions of suffering, their natural sphere.Claiming the right of relationship, Eugenie began to fold the linenand put in order the toilet articles which Charles had brought; thusshe could marvel at her ease over each luxurious bauble and thevarious knick-knacks of silver or chased gold, which she held long inher hand under a pretext of examining them. Charles could not seewithout emotion the generous interest his aunt and cousin felt in him;he knew society in Paris well enough to feel assured that, placed ashe now was, he would find all hearts indifferent or cold. Eugenie thusappeared to him in the splendor of a special beauty, and fromthenceforth he admired the innocence of life and manners which theprevious evening he had been inclined to ridicule. So when Eugenietook from Nanon the bowl of coffee and cream, and began to pour it outfor her cousin with the simplicity of real feeling, giving him akindly glance, the eyes of the Parisian filled with tears; he took herhand and kissed it.

　　"What troubles you?" she said.

　　"Oh! these are tears of gratitude," he answered.

　　Eugenie turned abruptly to the chimney-piece to take the candlesticks."Here, Nanon, carry them away!" she said.

　　When she looked again towards her cousin she was still blushing, buther looks could at least deceive, and did not betray the excess of joywhich innundated her heart; yet the eyes of both expressed the samesentiment as their souls flowed together in one thought,--the futurewas theirs. This soft emotion was all the more precious to Charles inthe midst of his heavy grief because it was wholly unexpected. Thesound of the knocker recalled the women to their usual station.Happily they were able to run downstairs with sufficient rapidity tobe seated at their work when Grandet entered; had he met them underthe archway it would have been enough to rouse his suspicions. Afterbreakfast, which the goodman took standing, the keeper from Froidfond,to whom the promised indemnity had never yet been paid, made hisappearance, bearing a hare and some partridges shot in the park, witheels and two pike sent as tribute by the millers.

　　"Ha, ha! poor Cornoiller; here he comes, like fish in Lent. Is allthat fit to eat?"

　　"Yes, my dear, generous master; it has been killed two days.""Come, Nanon, bestir yourself," said Grandet; "take these things,they'll do for dinner. I have invited the two Cruchots."

　　Nanon opened her eyes, stupid with amazement, and looked at everybodyin the room.

　　"Well!" she said, "and how am I to get the lard and the spices?""Wife," said Grandet, "give Nanon six francs, and remind me to getsome of the good wine out of the cellar."

　　"Well, then, Monsieur Grandet," said the keeper, who had come preparedwith an harangue for the purpose of settling the question of theindemnity, "Monsieur Grandet--"

　　"Ta, ta, ta, ta!" said Grandet; "I know what you want to say. You area good fellow; we will see about it to-morrow, I'm too busy to-day.Wife, give him five francs," he added to Madame Grandet as hedecamped.

　　The poor woman was only too happy to buy peace at the cost of elevenfrancs. She knew that Grandet would let her alone for a fortnightafter he had thus taken back, franc by franc, the money he had givenher.

　　"Here, Cornoiller," she said, slipping ten francs into the man's hand,"some day we will reward your services."

　　Cornoiller could say nothing, so he went away.

　　"Madame," said Nanon, who had put on her black coif and taken herbasket, "I want only three francs. You keep the rest; it'll go fastenough somehow."

　　"Have a good dinner, Nanon; my cousin will come down," said Eugenie."Something very extraordinary is going on, I am certain of it," saidMadame Grandet. "This is only the third time since our marriage thatyour father has given a dinner."

　　*****

　　About four o'clock, just as Eugenie and her mother had finishedsetting the table for six persons, and after the master of the househad brought up a few bottles of the exquisite wine which provincialscherish with true affection, Charles came down into the hall. Theyoung fellow was pale; his gestures, the expression of his face, hisglance, and the tones of his voice, all had a sadness which was fullof grace. He was not pretending grief, he truly suffered; and the veilof pain cast over his features gave him an interesting air dear to theheart of women. Eugenie loved him the more for it. Perhaps she feltthat sorrow drew him nearer to her. Charles was no longer the rich anddistinguished young man placed in a sphere far above her, but arelation plunged into frightful misery. Misery begets equality. Womenhave this in common with the angels,--suffering humanity belongs tothem. Charles and Eugenie understood each other and spoke only withtheir eyes; for the poor fallen dandy, orphaned and impoverished, satapart in a corner of the room, and was proudly calm and silent. Yet,from time to time, the gentle and caressing glance of the young girlshone upon him and constrained him away from his sad thoughts, drawinghim with her into the fields of hope and of futurity, where she lovedto hold him at her side.

　　VII

　　At this moment the town of Saumur was more excited about the dinnergiven by Grandet to the Cruchots than it had been the night before atthe sale of his vintage, though that constituted a crime of high-treason against the whole wine-growing community. If the politic oldmiser had given his dinner from the same idea that cost the dog ofAlcibiades his tail, he might perhaps have been called a great man;but the fact is, considering himself superior to a community which hecould trick on all occasions, he paid very little heed to what Saumurmight say.

　　The des Grassins soon learned the facts of the failure and the violentdeath of Guillaume Grandet, and they determined to go to theirclient's house that very evening to commiserate his misfortune andshow him some marks of friendship, with a view of ascertaining themotives which had led him to invite the Cruchots to dinner. Atprecisely five o'clock Monsieur C. de Bonfons and his uncle the notaryarrived in their Sunday clothes. The party sat down to table and beganto dine with good appetites. Grandet was grave, Charles silent,Eugenie dumb, and Madame Grandet did not say more than usual; so thatthe dinner was, very properly, a repast of condolence. When they rosefrom table Charles said to his aunt and uncle,--

　　"Will you permit me to retire? I am obliged to undertake a long andpainful correspondence."

　　"Certainly, nephew."

　　As soon as the goodman was certain that Charles could hear nothing andwas probably deep in his letter-writing, he said, with a dissimulatingglance at his wife,--

　　"Madame Grandet, what we have to talk about will be Latin to you; itis half-past seven; you can go and attend to your household accounts.Good-night, my daughter."

　　He kissed Eugenie, and the two women departed. A scene now took placein which Pere Grandet brought to bear, more than at any other momentof his life, the shrewd dexterity he had acquired in his intercoursewith men, and which had won him from those whose flesh he sometimesbit too sharply the nickname of "the old dog." If the mayor of Saumurhad carried his ambition higher still, if fortunate circumstances,drawing him towards the higher social spheres, had sent him intocongresses where the affairs of nations were discussed, and had hethere employed the genius with which his personal interests hadendowed him, he would undoubtedly have proved nobly useful to hisnative land. Yet it is perhaps equally certain that outside of Saumurthe goodman would have cut a very sorry figure. Possibly there areminds like certain animals which cease to breed when transplanted fromthe climates in which they are born.

　　"M-m-mon-sieur le p-p-president, you said t-t-that b-b-bankruptcy--"The stutter which for years the old miser had assumed when it suitedhim, and which, together with the deafness of which he sometimescomplained in rainy weather, was thought in Saumur to be a naturaldefect, became at this crisis so wearisome to the two Cruchots thatwhile they listened they unconsciously made faces and moved theirlips, as if pronouncing the words over which he was hesitating andstuttering at will. Here it may be well to give the history of thisimpediment of the speech and hearing of Monsieur Grandet. No one inAnjou heard better, or could pronounce more crisply the Frenchlanguage (with an Angevin accent) than the wily old cooper. Some yearsearlier, in spite of his shrewdness, he had been taken in by anIsraelite, who in the course of the discussion held his hand behindhis ear to catch sounds, and mangled his meaning so thoroughly intrying to utter his words that Grandet fell a victim to his humanityand was compelled to prompt the wily Jew with the words and ideas heseemed to seek, to complete himself the arguments of the said Jew, tosay what that cursed Jew ought to have said for himself; in short, tobe the Jew instead of being Grandet. When the cooper came out of thiscurious encounter he had concluded the only bargain of which in thecourse of a long commercial life he ever had occasion to complain. Butif he lost at the time pecuniarily, he gained morally a valuablelesson; later, he gathered its fruits. Indeed, the goodman ended byblessing that Jew for having taught him the art of irritating hiscommercial antagonist and leading him to forget his own thoughts inhis impatience to suggest those over which his tormentor wasstuttering. No affair had ever needed the assistance of deafness,impediments of speech, and all the incomprehensible circumlocutionswith which Grandet enveloped his ideas, as much as the affair now inhand. In the first place, he did not mean to shoulder theresponsibility of his own scheme; in the next, he was determined toremain master of the conversation and to leave his real intentions indoubt.

　　"M-m-monsieur de B-B-Bonfons,"--for the second time in three yearsGrandet called the Cruchot nephew Monsieur de Bonfons; the presidentfelt he might consider himself the artful old fellow's son-in-law,--"you-ou said th-th-that b-b-bankruptcy c-c-could, in some c-c-cases,b-b-be p-p-prevented b-b-by--"

　　"By the courts of commerce themselves. It is done constantly," saidMonsieur C. de Bonfons, bestriding Grandet's meaning, or thinking heguessed it, and kindly wishing to help him out with it. "Listen.""Y-yes," said Grandet humbly, with the mischievous expression of a boywho is inwardly laughing at his teacher while he pays him the greatestattention.

　　"When a man so respected and important as, for example, your latebrother--"

　　"M-my b-b-brother, yes."

　　"--is threatened with insolvency--"

　　"They c-c-call it in-ins-s-solvency?"

　　"Yes; when his failure is imminent, the court of commerce, to which heis amenable (please follow me attentively), has the power, by adecree, to appoint a receiver. Liquidation, you understand, is not thesame as failure. When a man fails, he is dishonored; but when hemerely liquidates, he remains an honest man."

　　"T-t-that's very d-d-different, if it d-d-doesn't c-c-cost m-m-more,"said Grandet.

　　"But a liquidation can be managed without having recourse to thecourts at all. For," said the president, sniffing a pinch of snuff,"don't you know how failures are declared?"

　　"N-n-no, I n-n-never t-t-thought," answered Grandet.

　　"In the first place," resumed the magistrate, "by filing the schedulein the record office of the court, which the merchant may do himself,or his representative for him with a power of attorney duly certified.In the second place, the failure may be declared under compulsion fromthe creditors. Now if the merchant does not file his schedule, and ifno creditor appears before the courts to obtain a decree of insolvencyagainst the merchant, what happens?"

　　"W-w-what h-h-happens?"

　　"Why, the family of the deceased, his representatives, his heirs, orthe merchant himself, if he is not dead, or his friends if he is onlyhiding, liquidate his business. Perhaps you would like to liquidateyour brother's affairs?"

　　"Ah! Grandet," said the notary, "that would be the right thing to do.There is honor down here in the provinces. If you save your name--forit is your name--you will be a man--"

　　"A noble man!" cried the president, interrupting his uncle."Certainly," answered the old man, "my b-b-brother's name wasG-G-Grandet, like m-m-mine. Th-that's c-c-certain; I d-d-don'td-d-deny it. And th-th-this l-l-liquidation might be, in m-m-manyways, v-v-very advan-t-t-tageous t-t-to the interests of m-m-myn-n-nephew, whom I l-l-love. But I must consider. I don't k-k-know thet-t-tricks of P-P-Paris. I b-b-belong to Sau-m-mur, d-d-don't you see?M-m-my vines, my d-d-drains--in short, I've my own b-b-business. Inever g-g-give n-n-notes. What are n-n-notes? I t-t-take a goodm-m-many, but I have never s-s-signed one. I d-d-don't understand suchthings. I have h-h-heard say that n-n-notes c-c-can be b-b-bought up.""Of course," said the president. "Notes can be bought in the market,less so much per cent. Don't you understand?"

　　Grandet made an ear-trumpet of his hand, and the president repeatedhis words.

　　"Well, then," replied the man, "there's s-s-something to be g-g-gotout of it? I k-know n-nothing at my age about such th-th-things. Il-l-live here and l-l-look after the v-v-vines. The vines g-g-grow,and it's the w-w-wine that p-p-pays. L-l-look after the v-v-vintage,t-t-that's my r-r-rule. My c-c-chief interests are at Froidfond. Ic-c-can't l-l-leave my h-h-house to m-m-muddle myself with ad-d-devilish b-b-business I kn-know n-n-nothing about. You say I oughtto l-l-liquidate my b-b-brother's af-f-fairs, to p-p-prevent thef-f-failure. I c-c-can't be in two p-p-places at once, unless I were alittle b-b-bird, and--"

　　"I understand," cried the notary. "Well, my old friend, you havefriends, old friends, capable of devoting themselves to yourinterests."

　　"All right!" thought Grandet, "make haste and come to the point!""Suppose one of them went to Paris and saw your brother Guillaume'schief creditor and said to him--"

　　"One m-m-moment," interrupted the goodman, "said wh-wh-what? Somethingl-l-like this. Monsieur Gr-Grandet of Saumur this, Monsieur Grandet ofSaumur that. He l-loves his b-b-brother, he loves his n-nephew.Grandet is a g-g-good uncle; he m-m-means well. He has sold hisv-v-vintage. D-d-don't declare a f-f-failure; c-c-call a meeting;l-l-liquidate; and then Gr-Gr-Grandet will see what he c-c-can do.B-b-better liquidate than l-let the l-l-law st-st-stick its n-n-nosein. Hein? isn't it so?"

　　"Exactly so," said the president.

　　"B-because, don't you see, Monsieur de B-Bonfons, a man must l-l-lookb-b-before he l-leaps. If you c-c-can't, you c-c-can't. M-m-must knowall about the m-m-matter, all the resources and the debts, if youd-d-don't want to be r-r-ruined. Hein? isn't it so?"

　　"Certainly," said the president. "I'm of opinion that in a few monthsthe debts might be bought up for a certain sum, and then paid in fullby an agreement. Ha! ha! you can coax a dog a long way if you show hima bit of lard. If there has been no declaration of failure, and youhold a lien on the debts, you come out of the business as white as thedriven snow."

　　"Sn-n-now," said Grandet, putting his hand to his ear, "wh-wh-whatabout s-now?"

　　"But," cried the president, "do pray attend to what I am saying.""I am at-t-tending."

　　"A note is merchandise,--an article of barter which rises and falls inprices. That is a deduction from Jeremy Bentham's theory about usury.That writer has proved that the prejudice which condemned usurers toreprobation was mere folly."

　　"Whew!" ejaculated the goodman.

　　"Allowing that money, according to Bentham, is an article ofmerchandise, and that whatever represents money is equallymerchandise," resumed the president; "allowing also that it isnotorious that the commercial note, bearing this or that signature, isliable to the fluctuation of all commercial values, rises or falls inthe market, is dear at one moment, and is worth nothing at another,the courts decide--ah! how stupid I am, I beg your pardon--I aminclined to think you could buy up your brother's debts for twenty-five per cent."

　　"D-d-did you c-c-call him Je-Je-Jeremy B-Ben?"

　　"Bentham, an Englishman.'

　　"That's a Jeremy who might save us a lot of lamentations in business,"said the notary, laughing.

　　"Those Englishmen s-sometimes t-t-talk sense," said Grandet. "So,ac-c-cording to Ben-Bentham, if my b-b-brother's n-notes are worthn-n-nothing; if Je-Je--I'm c-c-correct, am I not? That seems c-c-clearto my m-m-mind--the c-c-creditors would be--No, would not be; Iunderstand."

　　"Let me explain it all," said the president. "Legally, if you acquirea title to all the debts of the Maison Grandet, your brother or hisheirs will owe nothing to any one. Very good."

　　"Very g-good," repeated Grandet.

　　"In equity, if your brother's notes are negotiated--negotiated, do youclearly understand the term?--negotiated in the market at a reductionof so much per cent in value, and if one of your friends happening tobe present should buy them in, the creditors having sold them of theirown free-will without constraint, the estate of the late Grandet ishonorably released."

　　"That's t-true; b-b-business is b-business," said the cooper."B-b-but, st-still, you know, it is d-d-difficult. I h-have n-nom-m-money and n-no t-t-time."

　　"Yes, but you need not undertake it. I am quite ready to go to Paris(you may pay my expenses, they will only be a trifle). I will see thecreditors and talk with them and get an extension of time, andeverything can be arranged if you will add something to the assets soas to buy up all title to the debts."

　　"We-we'll see about th-that. I c-c-can't and I w-w-won't bind myselfwithout--He who c-c-can't, can't; don't you see?"

　　"That's very true."

　　"I'm all p-p-put ab-b-bout by what you've t-t-told me. This is thef-first t-t-time in my life I have b-been obliged to th-th-think--""Yes, you are not a lawyer."

　　"I'm only a p-p-poor wine-g-grower, and know n-nothing about wh-whatyou have just t-told me; I m-m-must th-think about it."

　　"Very good," said the president, preparing to resume his argument."Nephew!" said the notary, interrupting him in a warning tone."Well, what, uncle?" answered the president.

　　"Let Monsieur Grandet explain his own intentions. The matter inquestion is of the first importance. Our good friend ought to definehis meaning clearly, and--"

　　A loud knock, which announced the arrival of the des Grassins family,succeeded by their entrance and salutations, hindered Cruchot fromconcluding his sentence. The notary was glad of the interruption, forGrandet was beginning to look suspiciously at him, and the wen gavesigns of a brewing storm. In the first place, the notary did not thinkit becoming in a president of the Civil courts to go to Paris andmanipulate creditors and lend himself to an underhand job whichclashed with the laws of strict integrity; moreover, never havingknown old Grandet to express the slightest desire to pay anything, nomatter what, he instinctively feared to see his nephew taking part inthe affair. He therefore profited by the entrance of the des Grassinsto take the nephew by the arm and lead him into the embrasure of thewindow,--

　　"You have said enough, nephew; you've shown enough devotion. Yourdesire to win the girl blinds you. The devil! you mustn't go at ittooth and nail. Let me sail the ship now; you can haul on the braces.Do you think it right to compromise your dignity as a magistrate insuch a--"

　　He stopped, for he heard Monsieur des Grassins saying to the oldcooper as they shook hands,--

　　"Grandet, we have heard of the frightful misfortunes which have justbefallen your family,--the failure of the house of Guillaume Grandetand the death of your brother. We have come to express our grief atthese sad events."

　　"There is but one sad event," said the notary, interrupting thebanker,--"the death of Monsieur Grandet, junior; and he would neverhave killed himself had he thought in time of applying to his brotherfor help. Our old friend, who is honorable to his finger-nails,intends to liquidate the debts of the Maison Grandet of Paris. To savehim the worry of legal proceedings, my nephew, the president, has justoffered to go to Paris and negotiate with the creditors for asatisfactory settlement."

　　These words, corroborated by Grandet's attitude as he stood silentlynursing his chin, astonished the three des Grassins, who had beenleisurely discussing the old man's avarice as they came along, verynearly accusing him of fratricide.

　　"Ah! I was sure of it," cried the banker, looking at his wife. "Whatdid I tell you just now, Madame des Grassins? Grandet is honorable tothe backbone, and would never allow his name to remain under theslightest cloud! Money without honor is a disease. There is honor inthe provinces! Right, very right, Grandet. I'm an old soldier, and Ican't disguise my thoughts; I speak roughly. Thunder! it is sublime!""Th-then s-s-sublime th-things c-c-cost d-dear," answered the goodman,as the banker warmly wrung his hand.

　　"But this, my dear Grandet,--if the president will excuse me,--is apurely commercial matter, and needs a consummate business man. Youragent must be some one fully acquainted with the markets,--withdisbursements, rebates, interest calculations, and so forth. I amgoing to Paris on business of my own, and I can take charge of--""We'll see about t-t-trying to m-m-manage it b-b-between us, under thep-p-peculiar c-c-circumstances, b-b-but without b-b-binding m-m-myselfto anything th-that I c-c-could not do," said Grandet, stuttering;"because, you see, monsieur le president naturally expects me to paythe expenses of his journey."

　　The goodman did not stammer over the last words.

　　"Eh!" cried Madame des Grassins, "why it is a pleasure to go to Paris.I would willingly pay to go myself."

　　She made a sign to her husband, as if to encourage him in cutting theenemy out of the commission, /coute que coute/; then she glancedironically at the two Cruchots, who looked chap-fallen. Grandet seizedthe banker by a button and drew him into a corner of the room."I have a great deal more confidence in you than in the president," hesaid; "besides, I've other fish to fry," he added, wriggling his wen."I want to buy a few thousand francs in the Funds while they are ateighty. They fall, I'm told, at the end of each month. You know allabout these things, don't you?"

　　"Bless me! then, am I to invest enough to give you a few thousandfrancs a year?"

　　"That's not much to begin with. Hush! I don't want any one to know Iam going to play that game. You can make the investment by the end ofthe month. Say nothing to the Cruchots; that'll annoy them. If you arereally going to Paris, we will see if there is anything to be done formy poor nephew."

　　"Well, it's all settled. I'll start to-morrow by the mail-post," saiddes Grassins aloud, "and I will come and take your last directions at--what hour will suit you?"

　　"Five o'clock, just before dinner," said Grandet, rubbing his hands.The two parties stayed on for a short time. Des Grassins said, after apause, striking Grandet on the shoulder,--

　　"It is a good thing to have a relation like him."

　　"Yes, yes; without making a show," said Grandet, "I am a g-goodrelation. I loved my brother, and I will prove it, unless itc-c-costs--"

　　"We must leave you, Grandet," said the banker, interrupting himfortunately before he got to the end of his sentence. "If I hurry mydeparture, I must attend to some matters at once."

　　"Very good, very good! I myself--in c-consequence of what I t-told you--I must retire to my own room and 'd-d-deliberate,' as PresidentCruchot says."

　　"Plague take him! I am no longer Monsieur de Bonfons," thought themagistrate ruefully, his face assuming the expression of a judge boredby an argument.

　　The heads of the two factions walked off together. Neither gave anyfurther thought to the treachery Grandet had been guilty of in themorning against the whole wine-growing community; each tried to fathomwhat the other was thinking about the real intentions of the wily oldman in this new affair, but in vain.

　　"Will you go with us to Madame Dorsonval's?" said des Grassins to thenotary.

　　"We will go there later," answered the president. "I have promised tosay good-evening to Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt, and we will go therefirst, if my uncle is willing."

　　"Farewell for the present!" said Madame des Grassins.

　　When the Cruchots were a few steps off, Adolphe remarked to hisfather,--

　　"Are not they fuming, hein?"

　　"Hold your tongue, my son!" said his mother; "they might hear you.Besides, what you say is not in good taste,--law-school language.""Well, uncle," cried the president when he saw the des Grassinsdisappearing, "I began by being de Bonfons, and I have ended asnothing but Cruchot."

　　"I saw that that annoyed you; but the wind has set fair for the desGrassins. What a fool you are, with all your cleverness! Let them sailoff on Grandet's 'We'll see about it,' and keep yourself quiet, youngman. Eugenie will none the less be your wife."

　　In a few moments the news of Grandet's magnanimous resolve wasdisseminated in three houses at the same moment, and the whole townbegan to talk of his fraternal devotion. Every one forgave Grandet forthe sale made in defiance of the good faith pledged to the community;they admired his sense of honor, and began to laud a generosity ofwhich they had never thought him capable. It is part of the Frenchnature to grow enthusiastic, or angry, or fervent about some meteor ofthe moment. Can it be that collective beings, nationalities, peoples,are devoid of memory?

　　When Pere Grandet had shut the door he called Nanon.

　　"Don't let the dog loose, and don't go to bed; we have work to dotogether. At eleven o'clock Cornoiller will be at the door with thechariot from Froidfond. Listen for him and prevent his knocking; tellhim to come in softly. Police regulations don't allow nocturnalracket. Besides, the whole neighborhood need not know that I amstarting on a journey."

　　So saying, Grandet returned to his private room, where Nanon heard himmoving about, rummaging, and walking to and fro, though with muchprecaution, for he evidently did not wish to wake his wife anddaughter, and above all not to rouse the attention of his nephew, whomhe had begun to anathematize when he saw a thread of light under hisdoor. About the middle of the night Eugenie, intent on her cousin,fancied she heard a cry like that of a dying person. It must beCharles, she thought; he was so pale, so full of despair when she hadseen him last,--could he have killed himself? She wrapped herselfquickly in a loose garment,--a sort of pelisse with a hood,--and wasabout to leave the room when a bright light coming through the chinksof her door made her think of fire. But she recovered herself as sheheard Nanon's heavy steps and gruff voice mingling with the snortingof several horses.

　　"Can my father be carrying off my cousin?" she said to herself,opening her door with great precaution lest it should creak, and yetenough to let her see into the corridor.

　　Suddenly her eye encountered that of her father; and his glance, vagueand unnoticing as it was, terrified her. The goodman and Nanon wereyoked together by a stout stick, each end of which rested on theirshoulders; a stout rope was passed over it, on which was slung a smallbarrel or keg like those Pere Grandet still made in his bakehouse asan amusement for his leisure hours.

　　"Holy Virgin, how heavy it is!" said the voice of Nanon.

　　"What a pity that it is only copper sous!" answered Grandet. "Takecare you don't knock over the candlestick."

　　The scene was lighted by a single candle placed between two rails ofthe staircase.

　　"Cornoiller," said Grandet to his keeper /in partibus/, "have youbrought your pistols?"

　　"No, monsieur. Mercy! what's there to fear for your copper sous?""Oh! nothing," said Pere Grandet.

　　"Besides, we shall go fast," added the man; "your farmers have pickedout their best horses."

　　"Very good. You did not tell them where I was going?"

　　"I didn't know where."

　　"Very good. Is the carriage strong?"

　　"Strong? hear to that, now! Why, it can carry three thousand weight.How much does that old keg weigh?"

　　"Goodness!" exclaimed Nanon. "I ought to know! There's pretty nigheighteen hundred--"

　　"Will you hold your tongue, Nanon! You are to tell my wife I have goneinto the country. I shall be back to dinner. Drive fast, Cornoiller; Imust get to Angers before nine o'clock."

　　The carriage drove off. Nanon bolted the great door, let loose thedog, and went off to bed with a bruised shoulder, no one in theneighborhood suspecting either the departure of Grandet or the objectof his journey. The precautions of the old miser and his reticencewere never relaxed. No one had ever seen a penny in that house, filledas it was with gold. Hearing in the morning, through the gossip of theport, that exchange on gold had doubled in price in consequence ofcertain military preparations undertaken at Nantes, and thatspeculators had arrived at Angers to buy coin, the old wine-grower, bythe simple process of borrowing horses from his farmers, seized thechance of selling his gold and of bringing back in the form oftreasury notes the sum he intended to put into the Funds, havingswelled it considerably by the exchange.

　　VIII

　　"My father has gone," thought Eugenie, who heard all that took placefrom the head of the stairs. Silence was restored in the house, andthe distant rumbling of the carriage, ceasing by degrees, no longerechoed through the sleeping town. At this moment Eugenie heard in herheart, before the sound caught her ears, a cry which pierced thepartitions and came from her cousin's chamber. A line of light, thinas the blade of a sabre, shone through a chink in the door and fellhorizontally on the balusters of the rotten staircase.

　　"He suffers!" she said, springing up the stairs. A second moan broughther to the landing near his room. The door was ajar, she pushed itopen. Charles was sleeping; his head hung over the side of the oldarmchair, and his hand, from which the pen had fallen, nearly touchedthe floor. The oppressed breathing caused by the strained posturesuddenly frightened Eugenie, who entered the room hastily."He must be very tired," she said to herself, glancing at a dozenletters lying sealed upon the table. She read their addresses: "ToMessrs. Farry, Breilmann, & Co., carriage-makers"; "To MonsieurBuisson, tailor," etc.

　　"He has been settling all his affairs, so as to leave France at once,"she thought. Her eyes fell upon two open letters. The words, "My dearAnnette," at the head of one of them, blinded her for a moment. Herheart beat fast, her feet were nailed to the floor.

　　"His dear Annette! He loves! he is loved! No hope! What does he say toher?"

　　These thoughts rushed through her head and heart. She saw the wordseverywhere, even on the bricks of the floor, in letters of fire."Resign him already? No, no! I will not read the letter. I ought to goaway--What if I do read it?"

　　She looked at Charles, then she gently took his head and placed itagainst the back of the chair; he let her do so, like a child which,though asleep, knows its mother's touch and receives, without awaking,her kisses and watchful care. Like a mother Eugenie raised thedrooping hand, and like a mother she gently kissed the chestnut hair--"Dear Annette!" a demon shrieked the words in her ear.

　　"I am doing wrong; but I must read it, that letter," she said. Sheturned away her head, for her noble sense of honor reproached her. Forthe first time in her life good and evil struggled together in herheart. Up to that moment she had never had to blush for any action.Passion and curiosity triumphed. As she read each sentence her heartswelled more and more, and the keen glow which filled her being as shedid so, only made the joys of first love still more precious.

　　My dear Annette,--Nothing could ever have separated us but the

　　great misfortune which has now overwhelmed me, and which no human

　　foresight could have prevented. My father has killed himself; his

　　fortune and mine are irretrievably lost. I am orphaned at an age

　　when, through the nature of my education, I am still a child; and

　　yet I must lift myself as a man out of the abyss into which I am

　　plunged. I have just spent half the night in facing my position.

　　If I wish to leave France an honest man,--and there is no doubt of

　　that,--I have not a hundred francs of my own with which to try my

　　fate in the Indies or in America. Yes, my poor Anna, I must seek

　　my fortune in those deadly climates. Under those skies, they tell

　　me, I am sure to make it. As for remaining in Paris, I cannot do

　　so. Neither my nature nor my face are made to bear the affronts,

　　the neglect, the disdain shown to a ruined man, the son of a

　　bankrupt! Good God! think of owing two millions! I should be

　　killed in a duel the first week; therefore I shall not return

　　there. Your love--the most tender and devoted love which ever

　　ennobled the heart of man--cannot draw me back. Alas! my beloved,

　　I have no money with which to go to you, to give and receive a

　　last kiss from which I might derive some strength for my forlorn

　　enterprise.

　　"Poor Charles! I did well to read the letter. I have gold; I will giveit to him," thought Eugenie.

　　She wiped her eyes, and went on reading.

　　I have never thought of the miseries of poverty. If I have the

　　hundred louis required for the mere costs of the journey, I have

　　not a sou for an outfit. But no, I have not the hundred louis, not

　　even one louis. I don't know that anything will be left after I

　　have paid my debts in Paris. If I have nothing, I shall go quietly

　　to Nantes and ship as a common sailor; and I will begin in the new

　　world like other men who have started young without a sou and

　　brought back the wealth of the Indies. During this long day I have

　　faced my future coolly. It seems more horrible for me than for

　　another, because I have been so petted by a mother who adored me,

　　so indulged by the kindest of fathers, so blessed by meeting, on

　　my entrance into life, with the love of an Anna! The flowers of

　　life are all I have ever known. Such happiness could not last.

　　Nevertheless, my dear Annette, I feel more courage than a careless

　　young man is supposed to feel,--above all a young man used to the

　　caressing ways of the dearest woman in all Paris, cradled in

　　family joys, on whom all things smiled in his home, whose wishes

　　were a law to his father--oh, my father! Annette, he is dead!

　　Well, I have thought over my position, and yours as well. I have

　　grown old in twenty-four hours. Dear Anna, if in order to keep me

　　with you in Paris you were to sacrifice your luxury, your dress,

　　your opera-box, we should even then not have enough for the

　　expenses of my extravagant ways of living. Besides, I would never

　　accept such sacrifices. No, we must part now and forever--"He gives her up! Blessed Virgin! What happiness!"

　　Eugenie quivered with joy. Charles made a movement, and a chill ofterror ran through her. Fortunately, he did not wake, and she resumedher reading.

　　When shall I return? I do not know. The climate of the West Indies

　　ages a European, so they say; especially a European who works

　　hard. Let us think what may happen ten years hence. In ten years

　　your daughter will be eighteen; she will be your companion, your

　　spy. To you society will be cruel, and your daughter perhaps more

　　cruel still. We have seen cases of the harsh social judgment and

　　ingratitude of daughters; let us take warning by them. Keep in the

　　depths of your soul, as I shall in mine, the memory of four years

　　of happiness, and be faithful, if you can, to the memory of your

　　poor friend. I cannot exact such faithfulness, because, do you

　　see, dear Annette, I must conform to the exigencies of my new

　　life; I must take a commonplace view of them and do the best I

　　can. Therefore I must think of marriage, which becomes one of the

　　necessities of my future existence; and I will admit to you that I

　　have found, here in Saumur, in my uncle's house, a cousin whose

　　face, manners, mind, and heart would please you, and who, besides,

　　seems to me--

　　"He must have been very weary to have ceased writing to her," thoughtEugenie, as she gazed at the letter which stopped abruptly in themiddle of the last sentence.

　　Already she defended him. How was it possible that an innocent girlshould perceive the cold-heartedness evinced by this letter? To younggirls religiously brought up, whose minds are ignorant and pure, allis love from the moment they set their feet within the enchantedregions of that passion. They walk there bathed in a celestial lightshed from their own souls, which reflects its rays upon their lover;they color all with the flame of their own emotion and attribute tohim their highest thoughts. A woman's errors come almost always fromher belief in good or her confidence in truth. In Eugenie's simpleheart the words, "My dear Annette, my loved one," echoed like thesweetest language of love; they caressed her soul as, in childhood,the divine notes of the /Venite adoremus/, repeated by the organ,caressed her ear. Moreover, the tears which still lingered on theyoung man's lashes gave signs of that nobility of heart by which younggirls are rightly won. How could she know that Charles, though heloved his father and mourned him truly, was moved far more by paternalgoodness than by the goodness of his own heart? Monsieur and MadameGuillaume Grandet, by gratifying every fancy of their son, andlavishing upon him the pleasures of a large fortune, had kept him frommaking the horrible calculations of which so many sons in Paris becomemore or less guilty when, face to face with the enjoyments of theworld, they form desires and conceive schemes which they see withbitterness must be put off or laid aside during the lifetime of theirparents. The liberality of the father in this instance had shed intothe heart of the son a real love, in which there was no afterthoughtof self-interest.

　　Nevertheless, Charles was a true child of Paris, taught by the customsof society and by Annette herself to calculate everything; already anold man under the mask of youth. He had gone through the frightfuleducation of social life, of that world where in one evening morecrimes are committed in thought and speech than justice ever punishesat the assizes; where jests and clever sayings assassinate the noblestideas; where no one is counted strong unless his mind sees clear: andto see clear in that world is to believe in nothing, neither infeelings, nor in men, nor even in events,--for events are falsified.There, to "see clear" we must weigh a friend's purse daily, learn howto keep ourselves adroitly on the top of the wave, cautiously admirenothing, neither works of art nor glorious actions, and remember thatself-interest is the mainspring of all things here below. Aftercommitting many follies, the great lady--the beautiful Annette--compelled Charles to think seriously; with her perfumed hand among hiscurls, she talked to him of his future position; as she rearranged hislocks, she taught him lessons of worldly prudence; she made himeffeminate and materialized him,--a double corruption, but a delicateand elegant corruption, in the best taste.

　　"You are very foolish, Charles," she would say to him. "I shall have agreat deal of trouble in teaching you to understand the world. Youbehaved extremely ill to Monsieur des Lupeaulx. I know very well he isnot an honorable man; but wait till he is no longer in power, then youmay despise him as much as you like. Do you know what Madame Campanused to tell us?--'My dears, as long as a man is a minister, adorehim; when he falls, help to drag him in the gutter. Powerful, he is asort of god; fallen, he is lower than Marat in the sewer, because heis living, and Marat is dead. Life is a series of combinations, andyou must study them and understand them if you want to keep yourselvesalways in good position.'"

　　Charles was too much a man of the world, his parents had made him toohappy, he had received too much adulation in society, to be possessedof noble sentiments. The grain of gold dropped by his mother into hisheart was beaten thin in the smithy of Parisian society; he had spreadit superficially, and it was worn away by the friction of life.Charles was only twenty-one years old. At that age the freshness ofyouth seems inseparable from candor and sincerity of soul. The voice,the glance, the face itself, seem in harmony with the feelings; andthus it happens that the sternest judge, the most sceptical lawyer,the least complying of usurers, always hesitate to admit decrepitudeof heart or the corruption of worldly calculation while the eyes arestill bathed in purity and no wrinkles seam the brow. Charles, so far,had had no occasion to apply the maxims of Parisian morality; up tothis time he was still endowed with the beauty of inexperience. Andyet, unknown to himself, he had been inoculated with selfishness. Thegerms of Parisian political economy, latent in his heart, wouldassuredly burst forth, sooner or later, whenever the carelessspectator became an actor in the drama of real life.

　　Nearly all young girls succumb to the tender promises such an outwardappearance seems to offer: even if Eugenie had been as prudent andobserving as provincial girls are often found to be, she was notlikely to distrust her cousin when his manners, words, and actionswere still in unison with the aspirations of a youthful heart. A merechance--a fatal chance--threw in her way the last effusions of realfeeling which stirred the young man's soul; she heard as it were thelast breathings of his conscience. She laid down the letter--to her sofull of love--and began smilingly to watch her sleeping cousin; thefresh illusions of life were still, for her at least, upon his face;she vowed to herself to love him always. Then she cast her eyes on theother letter, without attaching much importance to this secondindiscretion; and though she read it, it was only to obtain new proofsof the noble qualities which, like all women, she attributed to theman her heart had chosen.

　　My dear Alphonse,--When you receive this letter I shall be without

　　friends; but let me assure you that while I doubt the friendship

　　of the world, I have never doubted yours. I beg you therefore to

　　settle all my affairs, and I trust to you to get as much as you

　　can out of my possessions. By this time you know my situation. I

　　have nothing left, and I intend to go at once to the Indies. I

　　have just written to all the people to whom I think I owe money,

　　and you will find enclosed a list of their names, as correct as I

　　can make it from memory. My books, my furniture, my pictures, my

　　horses, etc., ought, I think, to pay my debts. I do not wish to

　　keep anything, except, perhaps, a few baubles which might serve as

　　the beginning of an outfit for my enterprise. My dear Alphonse, I

　　will send you a proper power of attorney under which you can make

　　these sales. Send me all my weapons. Keep Briton for yourself;

　　nobody would pay the value of that noble beast, and I would rather

　　give him to you--like a mourning-ring bequeathed by a dying man to

　　his executor. Farry, Breilmann, & Co. built me a very comfortable

　　travelling-carriage, which they have not yet delivered; persuade

　　them to keep it and not ask for any payment on it. If they refuse,

　　do what you can in the matter, and avoid everything that might

　　seem dishonorable in me under my present circumstances. I owe the

　　British Islander six louis, which I lost at cards; don't fail to

　　pay him--

　　"Dear cousin!" whispered Eugenie, throwing down the letter and runningsoftly back to her room, carrying one of the lighted candles. A thrillof pleasure passed over her as she opened the drawer of an old oakcabinet, a fine specimen of the period called the Renaissance, onwhich could still be seen, partly effaced, the famous royalsalamander. She took from the drawer a large purse of red velvet withgold tassels, edged with a tarnished fringe of gold wire,--a relicinherited from her grandmother. She weighed it proudly in her hand,and began with delight to count over the forgotten items of her littlehoard. First she took out twenty /portugaises/, still new, struck inthe reign of John V., 1725, worth by exchange, as her father told her,five /lisbonnines/, or a hundred and sixty-eight francs, sixty-fourcentimes each; their conventional value, however, was a hundred andeighty francs apiece, on account of the rarity and beauty of thecoins, which shone like little suns. Item, five /genovines/, or fivehundred-franc pieces of Genoa; another very rare coin worth eighty-seven francs on exchange, but a hundred francs to collectors. Thesehad formerly belonged to old Monsieur de la Bertelliere. Item, threegold /quadruples/, Spanish, of Philip V., struck in 1729, given to herone by one by Madame Gentillet, who never failed to say, using thesame words, when she made the gift, "This dear little canary, thislittle yellow-boy, is worth ninety-eight francs! Keep it, my prettyone, it will be the flower of your treasure." Item (that which herfather valued most of all, the gold of these coins being twenty-threecarats and a fraction), a hundred Dutch ducats, made in the year 1756,and worth thirteen francs apiece. Item, a great curiosity, a speciesof medal precious to the soul of misers,--three rupees with the signof the Scales, and five rupees with the sign of the Virgin, all inpure gold of twenty-four carats; the magnificent money of the GreatMogul, each of which was worth by mere weight thirty-seven francs,forty centimes, but at least fifty francs to those connoisseurs wholove to handle gold. Item, the napoleon of forty francs received theday before, which she had forgotten to put away in the velvet purse.This treasure was all in virgin coins, true works of art, whichGrandet from time to time inquired after and asked to see, pointingout to his daughter their intrinsic merits,--such as the beauty of themilled edge, the clearness of the flat surface, the richness of thelettering, whose angles were not yet rubbed off.

　　Eugenie gave no thought to these rarities, nor to her father's maniafor them, nor to the danger she incurred in depriving herself of atreasure so dear to him; no, she thought only of her cousin, and soonmade out, after a few mistakes of calculation, that she possessedabout five thousand eight hundred francs in actual value, which mightbe sold for their additional value to collectors for nearly sixthousand. She looked at her wealth and clapped her hands like a happychild forced to spend its overflowing joy in artless movements of thebody. Father and daughter had each counted up their fortune thisnight,--he, to sell his gold; Eugenie to fling hers into the ocean ofaffection. She put the pieces back into the old purse, took it in herhand, and ran upstairs without hesitation. The secret misery of hercousin made her forget the hour and conventional propriety; she wasstrong in her conscience, in her devotion, in her happiness.As she stood upon the threshold of the door, holding the candle in onehand and the purse in the other, Charles woke, caught sight of her,and remained speechless with surprise. Eugenie came forward, put thecandle on the table, and said in a quivering voice:

　　"My cousin, I must beg pardon for a wrong I have done you; but Godwill pardon me--if you--will help me to wipe it out."

　　"What is it?" asked Charles, rubbing his eyes.

　　"I have read those letters."

　　Charles colored.

　　"How did it happen?" she continued; "how came I here? Truly, I do notknow. I am tempted not to regret too much that I have read them; theyhave made me know your heart, your soul, and--"

　　"And what?" asked Charles.

　　"Your plans, your need of a sum--"

　　"My dear cousin--"

　　"Hush, hush! my cousin, not so loud; we must not wake others. See,"she said, opening her purse, "here are the savings of a poor girl whowants nothing. Charles, accept them! This morning I was ignorant ofthe value of money; you have taught it to me. It is but a means, afterall. A cousin is almost a brother; you can surely borrow the purse ofyour sister."

　　Eugenie, as much a woman as a young girl, never dreamed of refusal;but her cousin remained silent.

　　"Oh! you will not refuse?" cried Eugenie, the beatings of whose heartcould be heard in the deep silence.

　　Her cousin's hesitation mortified her; but the sore need of hisposition came clearer still to her mind, and she knelt down."I will never rise till you have taken that gold!" she said. "Mycousin, I implore you, answer me! let me know if you respect me, ifyou are generous, if--"

　　As he heard this cry of noble distress the young man's tears fell uponhis cousin's hands, which he had caught in his own to keep her fromkneeling. As the warm tears touched her, Eugenie sprang to the purseand poured its contents upon the table.

　　"Ah! yes, yes, you consent?" she said, weeping with joy. "Fearnothing, my cousin, you will be rich. This gold will bring youhappiness; some day you shall bring it back to me,--are we notpartners? I will obey all conditions. But you should not attach suchvalue to the gift."

　　Charles was at last able to express his feelings.

　　"Yes, Eugenie; my soul would be small indeed if I did not accept. Andyet,--gift for gift, confidence for confidence."

　　"What do you mean?" she said, frightened.

　　"Listen, dear cousin; I have here--" He interrupted himself to pointout a square box covered with an outer case of leather which was onthe drawers. "There," he continued, "is something as precious to me aslife itself. This box was a present from my mother. All day I havebeen thinking that if she could rise from her grave, she would herselfsell the gold which her love for me lavished on this dressing-case;but were I to do so, the act would seem to me a sacrilege." Eugeniepressed his hand as she heard these last words. "No," he added, aftera slight pause, during which a liquid glance of tenderness passedbetween them, "no, I will neither sell it nor risk its safety on myjourney. Dear Eugenie, you shall be its guardian. Never did friendcommit anything more sacred to another. Let me show it to you."He went to the box, took it from its outer coverings, opened it, andshowed his delighted cousin a dressing-case where the rich workmanshipgave to the gold ornaments a value far above their weight."What you admire there is nothing," he said, pushing a secret springwhich opened a hidden drawer. "Here is something which to me is worththe whole world." He drew out two portraits, masterpieces of MadameMirbel, richly set with pearls.

　　"Oh, how beautiful! Is it the lady to whom you wrote that--""No," he said, smiling; "this is my mother, and here is my father,your aunt and uncle. Eugenie, I beg you on my knees, keep my treasuresafely. If I die and your little fortune is lost, this gold and thesepearls will repay you. To you alone could I leave these portraits; youare worthy to keep them. But destroy them at last, so that they maypass into no other hands." Eugenie was silent. "Ah, yes, say yes! Youconsent?" he added with winning grace.

　　Hearing the very words she had just used to her cousin now addressedto herself, she turned upon him a look of love, her first look ofloving womanhood,--a glance in which there is nearly as much ofcoquetry as of inmost depth. He took her hand and kissed it."Angel of purity! between us two money is nothing, never can beanything. Feeling, sentiment, must be all henceforth."

　　"You are like your mother,--was her voice as soft as yours?""Oh! much softer--"

　　"Yes, for you," she said, dropping her eyelids. "Come, Charles, go tobed; I wish it; you must be tired. Good-night." She gently disengagedher hand from those of her cousin, who followed her to her room,lighting the way. When they were both upon the threshold,--"Ah!" he said, "why am I ruined?"

　　"What matter?--my father is rich; I think so," she answered."Poor child!" said Charles, making a step into her room and leaninghis back against the wall, "if that were so, he would never have letmy father die; he would not let you live in this poor way; he wouldlive otherwise himself."

　　"But he owns Froidfond."

　　"What is Froidfond worth?"

　　"I don't know; but he has Noyers."

　　"Nothing but a poor farm!"

　　"He has vineyards and fields."

　　"Mere nothing," said Charles disdainfully. "If your father had onlytwenty-four thousand francs a year do you suppose you would live inthis cold, barren room?" he added, making a step in advance. "Ah!there you will keep my treasures," he said, glancing at the oldcabinet, as if to hide his thoughts.

　　"Go and sleep," she said, hindering his entrance into the disorderedroom.

　　Charles stepped back, and they bid each other good-night with a mutualsmile.

　　Both fell asleep in the same dream; and from that moment the youthbegan to wear roses with his mourning. The next day, before breakfast,Madame Grandet found her daughter in the garden in company withCharles. The young man was still sad, as became a poor fellow who,plunged in misfortune, measures the depths of the abyss into which hehas fallen, and sees the terrible burden of his whole future life."My father will not be home till dinner-time," said Eugenie,perceiving the anxious look on her mother's face.

　　It was easy to trace in the face and manners of the young girl and inthe singular sweetness of her voice a unison of thought between herand her cousin. Their souls had espoused each other, perhaps beforethey even felt the force of the feelings which bound them together.Charles spent the morning in the hall, and his sadness was respected.Each of the three women had occupations of her own. Grandet had leftall his affairs unattended to, and a number of persons came onbusiness,--the plumber, the mason, the slater, the carpenter, thediggers, the dressers, the farmers; some to drive a bargain aboutrepairs, others to pay their rent or to be paid themselves forservices. Madame Grandet and Eugenie were obliged to go and come andlisten to the interminable talk of all these workmen and country folk.Nanon put away in her kitchen the produce which they brought astribute. She always waited for her master's orders before she knewwhat portion was to be used in the house and what was to be sold inthe market. It was the goodman's custom, like that of a great manycountry gentlemen, to drink his bad wine and eat his spoiled fruit.Towards five in the afternoon Grandet returned from Angers, havingmade fourteen thousand francs by the exchange on his gold, bringinghome in his wallet good treasury-notes which bore interest until theday he should invest them in the Funds. He had left Cornoiller atAngers to look after the horses, which were well-nigh foundered, withorders to bring them home slowly after they were rested.

　　"I have got back from Angers, wife," he said; "I am hungry."Nanon called out to him from the kitchen: "Haven't you eaten anythingsince yesterday?"

　　"Nothing," answered the old man.

　　Nanon brought in the soup. Des Grassins came to take his client'sorders just as the family sat down to dinner. Grandet had not evenobserved his nephew.

　　"Go on eating, Grandet," said the banker; "we can talk. Do you knowwhat gold is worth in Angers? They have come from Nantes after it? Ishall send some of ours."

　　"Don't send any," said Grandet; "they have got enough. We are such oldfriends, I ought to save you from such a loss of time."

　　"But gold is worth thirteen francs fifty centimes."

　　"Say /was/ worth--"

　　"Where the devil have they got any?"

　　"I went to Angers last night," answered Grandet in a low voice.The banker shook with surprise. Then a whispered conversation beganbetween the two, during which Grandet and des Grassins frequentlylooked at Charles. Presently des Grassins gave a start ofastonishment; probably Grandet was then instructing him to invest thesum which was to give him a hundred thousand francs a year in theFunds.

　　"Monsieur Grandet," said the banker to Charles, "I am starting forParis; if you have any commissions--"

　　"None, monsieur, I thank you," answered Charles.

　　"Thank him better than that, nephew. Monsieur is going to settle theaffairs of the house of Guillaume Grandet."

　　"Is there any hope?" said Charles eagerly.

　　"What!" exclaimed his uncle, with well-acted pride, "are you not mynephew? Your honor is ours. Is not your name Grandet?"

　　Charles rose, seized Pere Grandet, kissed him, turned pale, and leftthe room. Eugenie looked at her father with admiration.

　　"Well, good-by, des Grassins; it is all in your hands. Decoy thosepeople as best you can; lead 'em by the nose."

　　The two diplomatists shook hands. The old cooper accompanied thebanker to the front door. Then, after closing it, he came back andplunged into his armchair, saying to Nanon,--

　　"Get me some black-currant ratafia."

　　Too excited, however, to remain long in one place, he got up, lookedat the portrait of Monsieur de la Bertelliere, and began to sing,doing what Nanon called his dancing steps,--

　　"Dans les gardes francaises

　　J'avais un bon papa."

　　Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie looked at each other in silence.The hilarity of the master always frightened them when it reached itsclimax. The evening was soon over. Pere Grandet chose to go to bedearly, and when he went to bed, everybody else was expected to go too;like as when Augustus drank, Poland was drunk. On this occasion Nanon,Charles, and Eugenie were not less tired than the master. As forMadame Grandet, she slept, ate, drank, and walked according to thewill of her husband. However, during the two hours consecrated todigestion, the cooper, more facetious than he had ever been in hislife, uttered a number of his own particular apothegms,--a single oneof which will give the measure of his mind. When he had drunk hisratafia, he looked at his glass and said,--

　　"You have no sooner put your lips to a glass than it is empty! Such islife. You can't have and hold. Gold won't circulate and stay in yourpurse. If it were not for that, life would be too fine."

　　He was jovial and benevolent. When Nanon came with her spinning-wheel,"You must be tired," he said; "put away your hemp."

　　"Ah, bah! then I shall get sleepy," she answered.

　　"Poor Nanon! Will you have some ratafia?"

　　"I won't refuse a good offer; madame makes it a deal better than theapothecaries. What they sell is all drugs."

　　"They put too much sugar," said the master; "you can't taste anythingelse."

　　IX

　　The following day the family, meeting at eight o'clock for the earlybreakfast, made a picture of genuine domestic intimacy. Grief haddrawn Madame Grandet, Eugenie, and Charles /en rapport/; even Nanonsympathized, without knowing why. The four now made one family. As tothe old man, his satisfied avarice and the certainty of soon gettingrid of the dandy without having to pay more than his journey toNantes, made him nearly indifferent to his presence in the house. Heleft the two children, as he called Charles and Eugenie, free toconduct themselves as they pleased, under the eye of Madame Grandet,in whom he had implicit confidence as to all that concerned public andreligious morality. He busied himself in straightening the boundariesof his fields and ditches along the high-road, in his poplar-plantations beside the Loire, in the winter work of his vineyards, andat Froidfond. All these things occupied his whole time.

　　For Eugenie the springtime of love had come. Since the scene at nightwhen she gave her little treasure to her cousin, her heart hadfollowed the treasure. Confederates in the same secret, they looked ateach other with a mutual intelligence which sank to the depth of theirconsciousness, giving a closer communion, a more intimate relation totheir feelings, and putting them, so to speak, beyond the pale ofordinary life. Did not their near relationship warrant the gentlenessin their tones, the tenderness in their glances? Eugenie took delightin lulling her cousin's pain with the pretty childish joys of a new-born love. Are there no sweet similitudes between the birth of loveand the birth of life? Do we not rock the babe with gentle songs andsoftest glances? Do we not tell it marvellous tales of the goldenfuture? Hope herself, does she not spread her radiant wings above itshead? Does it not shed, with infant fickleness, its tears of sorrowand its tears of joy? Does it not fret for trifles, cry for the prettypebbles with which to build its shifting palaces, for the flowersforgotten as soon as plucked? Is it not eager to grasp the comingtime, to spring forward into life? Love is our second transformation.Childhood and love were one and the same thing to Eugenie and toCharles; it was a first passion, with all its child-like play,--themore caressing to their hearts because they now were wrapped insadness. Struggling at birth against the gloom of mourning, their lovewas only the more in harmony with the provincial plainness of thatgray and ruined house. As they exchanged a few words beside the wellin the silent court, or lingered in the garden for the sunset hour,sitting on a mossy seat saying to each other the infinite nothings oflove, or mused in the silent calm which reigned between the house andthe ramparts like that beneath the arches of a church, Charlescomprehended the sanctity of love; for his great lady, his dearAnnette, had taught him only its stormy troubles. At this moment heleft the worldly passion, coquettish, vain, and showy as it was, andturned to the true, pure love. He loved even the house, whose customsno longer seemed to him ridiculous. He got up early in the morningsthat he might talk with Eugenie for a moment before her father came todole out the provisions; when the steps of the old man sounded on thestaircase he escaped into the garden. The small criminality of thismorning /tete-a-tete/ which Nanon pretended not to see, gave to theirinnocent love the lively charm of a forbidden joy.

　　After breakfast, when Grandet had gone to his fields and his otheroccupations, Charles remained with the mother and daughter, finding anunknown pleasure in holding their skeins, in watching them at work, inlistening to their quiet prattle. The simplicity of this half-monasticlife, which revealed to him the beauty of these souls, unknown andunknowing of the world, touched him keenly. He had believed suchmorals impossible in France, and admitted their existence nowhere butin Germany; even so, they seemed to him fabulous, only real in thenovels of Auguste Lafontaine. Soon Eugenie became to him the Margaretof Goethe--before her fall. Day by day his words, his looks enrapturedthe poor girl, who yielded herself up with delicious non-resistance tothe current of love; she caught her happiness as a swimmer seizes theoverhanging branch of a willow to draw himself from the river and lieat rest upon its shore. Did no dread of a coming absence sadden thehappy hours of those fleeting days? Daily some little circumstancereminded them of the parting that was at hand.

　　Three days after the departure of des Grassins, Grandet took hisnephew to the Civil courts, with the solemnity which country peopleattach to all legal acts, that he might sign a deed surrendering hisrights in his father's estate. Terrible renunciation! species ofdomestic apostasy! Charles also went before Maitre Cruchot to make twopowers of attorney,--one for des Grassins, the other for the friendwhom he had charged with the sale of his belongings. After that heattended to all the formalities necessary to obtain a passport forforeign countries; and finally, when he received his simple mourningclothes from Paris, he sent for the tailor of Saumur and sold to himhis useless wardrobe. This last act pleased Grandet exceedingly."Ah! now you look like a man prepared to embark and make yourfortune," he said, when Charles appeared in a surtout of plain blackcloth. "Good! very good!"

　　"I hope you will believe, monsieur," answered his nephew, "that Ishall always try to conform to my situation."

　　"What's that?" said his uncle, his eyes lighting up at a handful ofgold which Charles was carrying.

　　"Monsieur, I have collected all my buttons and rings and othersuperfluities which may have some value; but not knowing any one inSaumur, I wanted to ask you to--"

　　"To buy them?" said Grandet, interrupting him.

　　"No, uncle; only to tell me of an honest man who--"

　　"Give me those things, I will go upstairs and estimate their value; Iwill come back and tell you what it is to a fraction. Jeweller'sgold," examining a long chain, "eighteen or nineteen carats."The goodman held out his huge hand and received the mass of gold,which he carried away.

　　"Cousin," said Grandet, "may I offer you these two buttons? They canfasten ribbons round your wrists; that sort of bracelet is much thefashion just now."

　　"I accept without hesitation," she answered, giving him anunderstanding look.

　　"Aunt, here is my mother's thimble; I have always kept it carefully inmy dressing-case," said Charles, presenting a pretty gold thimble toMadame Grandet, who for many years had longed for one.

　　"I cannot thank you; no words are possible, my nephew," said the poormother, whose eyes filled with tears. "Night and morning in my prayersI shall add one for you, the most earnest of all--for those whotravel. If I die, Eugenie will keep this treasure for you.""They are worth nine hundred and eighty-nine francs, seventy-fivecentimes," said Grandet, opening the door. "To save you the pain ofselling them, I will advance the money--in /livres/."

　　The word /livres/ on the littoral of the Loire signifies that crownprices of six /livres/ are to be accepted as six francs withoutdeduction.

　　"I dared not propose it to you," answered Charles; "but it was mostrepugnant to me to sell my jewels to some second-hand dealer in yourown town. People should wash their dirty linen at home, as Napoleonsaid. I thank you for your kindness."

　　Grandet scratched his ear, and there was a moment's silence."My dear uncle," resumed Charles, looking at him with an uneasy air,as if he feared to wound his feelings, "my aunt and cousin have beenkind enough to accept a trifling remembrance of me. Will you allow meto give you these sleeve-buttons, which are useless to me now? Theywill remind you of a poor fellow who, far away, will always think ofthose who are henceforth all his family."

　　"My lad, my lad, you mustn't rob yourself this way! Let me see, wife,what have you got?" he added, turning eagerly to her. "Ah! a goldthimble. And you, little girl? What! diamond buttons? Yes, I'll acceptyour present, nephew," he answered, shaking Charles by the hand. "But--you must let me--pay--your--yes, your passage to the Indies. Yes, Iwish to pay your passage because--d'ye see, my boy?--in valuing yourjewels I estimated only the weight of the gold; very likely theworkmanship is worth something. So let us settle it that I am to giveyou fifteen hundred francs--in /livres/; Cruchot will lend them to me.I haven't got a copper farthing here,--unless Perrotet, who isbehindhand with his rent, should pay up. By the bye, I'll go and seehim."

　　He took his hat, put on his gloves, and went out.

　　"Then you are really going?" said Eugenie to her cousin, with a sadlook, mingled with admiration.

　　"I must," he said, bowing his head.

　　For some days past, Charles's whole bearing, manners, and speech hadbecome those of a man who, in spite of his profound affliction, feelsthe weight of immense obligations and has the strength to gathercourage from misfortune. He no longer repined, he became a man.Eugenie never augured better of her cousin's character than when shesaw him come down in the plain black clothes which suited well withhis pale face and sombre countenance. On that day the two women put ontheir own mourning, and all three assisted at a Requiem celebrated inthe parish church for the soul of the late Guillaume Grandet.At the second breakfast Charles received letters from Paris and beganto read them.

　　"Well, cousin, are you satisfied with the management of your affairs?"said Eugenie in a low voice.

　　"Never ask such questions, my daughter," said Grandet. "What thedevil! do I tell you my affairs? Why do you poke your nose into yourcousin's? Let the lad alone!"

　　"Oh! I haven't any secrets," said Charles.

　　"Ta, ta, ta, ta, nephew; you'll soon find out that you must hold yourtongue in business."

　　When the two lovers were alone in the garden, Charles said to Eugenie,drawing her down on the old bench beneath the walnut-tree,--"I did right to trust Alphonse; he has done famously. He has managedmy affairs with prudence and good faith. I now owe nothing in Paris.All my things have been sold; and he tells me that he has taken theadvice of an old sea-captain and spent three thousand francs on acommercial outfit of European curiosities which will be sure to be indemand in the Indies. He has sent my trunks to Nantes, where a ship isloading for San Domingo. In five days, Eugenie, we must bid each otherfarewell--perhaps forever, at least for years. My outfit and tenthousand francs, which two of my friends send me, are a very smallbeginning. I cannot look to return for many years. My dear cousin, donot weight your life in the scales with mine; I may perish; some goodmarriage may be offered to you--"

　　"Do you love me?" she said.

　　"Oh, yes! indeed, yes!" he answered, with a depth of tone thatrevealed an equal depth of feeling.

　　"I shall wait, Charles--Good heavens! there is my father at hiswindow," she said, repulsing her cousin, who leaned forward to kissher.

　　She ran quickly under the archway. Charles followed her. When she sawhim, she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the swing-door; then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eugenie reached thecorner near Nanon's den, in the darkest end of the passage. ThereCharles caught her hand and drew her to his heart. Passing his armabout her waist, he made her lean gently upon him. Eugenie no longerresisted; she received and gave the purest, the sweetest, and yet,withal, the most unreserved of kisses.

　　"Dear Eugenie, a cousin is better than a brother, for he can marryyou," said Charles.

　　"So be it!" cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair.

　　The two lovers, alarmed, fled into the hall, where Eugenie took up herwork and Charles began to read the litanies of the Virgin in MadameGrandet's prayer-book.

　　"Mercy!" cried Nanon, "now they're saying their prayers."As soon as Charles announced his immediate departure, Grandetbestirred himself to testify much interest in his nephew. He becamevery liberal of all that cost him nothing; took pains to find apacker; declared the man asked too much for his cases; insisted onmaking them himself out of old planks; got up early in the morning tofit and plane and nail together the strips, out of which he made, tohis own satisfaction, some strong cases, in which he packed allCharles's effects; he also took upon himself to send them by boat downthe Loire, to insure them, and get them to Nantes in proper time.After the kiss taken in the passage, the hours fled for Eugenie withfrightful rapidity. Sometimes she thought of following her cousin.Those who have known that most endearing of all passions,--the onewhose duration is each day shortened by time, by age, by mortalillness, by human chances and fatalities,--they will understand thepoor girl's tortures. She wept as she walked in the garden, now sonarrow to her, as indeed the court, the house, the town all seemed.She launched in thought upon the wide expanse of the ocean he wasabout to traverse. At last the eve of his departure came. Thatmorning, in the absence of Grandet and of Nanon, the precious casewhich contained the two portraits was solemnly installed in the onlydrawer of the old cabinet which could be locked, where the now emptyvelvet purse was lying. This deposit was not made without a goodlynumber of tears and kisses. When Eugenie placed the key within herbosom she had no courage to forbid the kiss with which Charles sealedthe act.

　　"It shall never leave that place, my friend," she said.

　　"Then my heart will be always there."

　　"Ah! Charles, it is not right," she said, as though she blamed him."Are we not married?" he said. "I have thy promise,--then take mine.""Thine; I am thine forever!" they each said, repeating the words twiceover.

　　No promise made upon this earth was ever purer. The innocent sincerityof Eugenie had sanctified for a moment the young man's love.On the morrow the breakfast was sad. Nanon herself, in spite of thegold-embroidered robe and the Jeannette cross bestowed by Charles, hadtears in her eyes.

　　"The poor dear monsieur who is going on the seas--oh, may God guidehim!"

　　At half-past ten the whole family started to escort Charles to thediligence for Nantes. Nanon let loose the dog, locked the door, andinsisted on carrying the young man's carpet-bag. All the tradesmen inthe tortuous old street were on the sill of their shop-doors to watchthe procession, which was joined in the market-place by MaitreCruchot.

　　"Eugenie, be sure you don't cry," said her mother.

　　"Nephew," said Grandet, in the doorway of the inn from which the coachstarted, kissing Charles on both cheeks, "depart poor, return rich;you will find the honor of your father safe. I answer for that myself,I--Grandet; for it will only depend on you to--"

　　"Ah! my uncle, you soften the bitterness of my departure. Is it notthe best gift that you could make me?"

　　Not understanding his uncle's words which he had thus interrupted,Charles shed tears of gratitude upon the tanned cheeks of the oldmiser, while Eugenie pressed the hand of her cousin and that of herfather with all her strength. The notary smiled, admiring the slyspeech of the old man, which he alone had understood. The family stoodabout the coach until it started; then as it disappeared upon thebridge, and its rumble grew fainter in the distance, Grandet said:"Good-by to you!"

　　Happily no one but Maitre Cruchot heard the exclamation. Eugenie andher mother had gone to a corner of the quay from which they couldstill see the diligence and wave their white handkerchiefs, to whichCharles made answer by displaying his.

　　"Ah! mother, would that I had the power of God for a single moment,"said Eugenie, when she could no longer see her lover's handkerchief.*****

　　Not to interrupt the current of events which are about to take placein the bosom of the Grandet family, it is necessary to cast aforestalling eye upon the various operations which the goodman carriedon in Paris by means of Monsieur des Grassins. A month after thelatter's departure from Saumur, Grandet, became possessed of acertificate of a hundred thousand francs a year from his investment inthe Funds, bought at eighty francs net. The particulars revealed athis death by the inventory of his property threw no light upon themeans which his suspicious nature took to remit the price of theinvestment and receive the certificate thereof. Maitre Cruchot was ofopinion that Nanon, unknown to herself, was the trusty instrument bywhich the money was transported; for about this time she was absentfive days, under a pretext of putting things to rights at Froidfond,--as if the goodman were capable of leaving anything lying about or outof order!

　　In all that concerned the business of the house of Guillaume Grandetthe old cooper's intentions were fulfilled to the letter. The Bank ofFrance, as everybody knows, affords exact information about all thelarge fortunes in Paris and the provinces. The names of des Grassinsand Felix Grandet of Saumur were well known there, and they enjoyedthe esteem bestowed on financial celebrities whose wealth comes fromimmense and unencumbered territorial possessions. The arrival of theSaumur banker for the purpose, it was said, of honorably liquidatingthe affairs of Grandet of Paris, was enough to avert the shame ofprotested notes from the memory of the defunct merchant. The seals onthe property were taken off in presence of the creditors, and thenotary employed by Grandet went to work at once on the inventory ofthe assets. Soon after this, des Grassins called a meeting of thecreditors, who unanimously elected him, conjointly with FrancoisKeller, the head of a rich banking-house and one of those principallyinterested in the affair, as liquidators, with full power to protectboth the honor of the family and the interests of the claimants. Thecredit of Grandet of Saumur, the hopes he diffused by means of desGrassins in the minds of all concerned, facilitated the transactions.Not a single creditor proved recalcitrant; no one thought of passinghis claim to his profit-and-loss account; each and all saidconfidently, "Grandet of Saumur will pay."

　　Six months went by. The Parisians had redeemed the notes incirculation as they fell due, and held them under lock and key intheir desks. First result aimed at by the old cooper! Nine monthsafter this preliminary meeting, the two liquidators distributed forty-seven per cent to each creditor on his claim. This amount was obtainedby the sale of the securities, property, and possessions of all kindsbelonging to the late Guillaume Grandet, and was paid over withscrupulous fidelity. Unimpeachable integrity was shown in thetransaction. The creditors gratefully acknowledged the remarkable andincontestable honor displayed by the Grandets. When these praises hadcirculated for a certain length of time, the creditors asked for therest of their money. It became necessary to write a collective letterto Grandet of Saumur.

　　"Here it comes!" said the old man as he threw the letter into thefire. "Patience, my good friends!"

　　In answer to the proposals contained in the letter, Grandet of Saumurdemanded that all vouchers for claims against the estate of hisbrother should be deposited with a notary, together with aquittancesfor the forty-seven per cent already paid; he made this demand underpretence of sifting the accounts and finding out the exact conditionof the estate. It roused at once a variety of difficulties. Generallyspeaking, the creditor is a species of maniac, ready to agree toanything one day, on the next breathing fire and slaughter; later on,he grows amicable and easy-going. To-day his wife is good-humored, hislast baby has cut its first tooth, all is well at home, and he isdetermined not to lose a sou; on the morrow it rains, he can't go out,he is gloomy, he says yes to any proposal that is made to him, so longas it will put an end to the affair; on the third day he declares hemust have guarantees; by the end of the month he wants his debtor'shead, and becomes at heart an executioner. The creditor is a good deallike the sparrow on whose tail confiding children are invited to putsalt,--with this difference, that he applies the image to his claim,the proceeds of which he is never able to lay hold of. Grandet hadstudied the atmospheric variations of creditors, and the creditors ofhis brother justified all his calculations. Some were angry, andflatly refused to give in their vouchers.

　　"Very good; so much the better," said Grandet, rubbing his hands overthe letter in which des Grassins announced the fact.

　　Others agreed to the demand, but only on condition that their rightsshould be fully guaranteed; they renounced none, and even reserved thepower of ultimately compelling a failure. On this began a longcorrespondence, which ended in Grandet of Saumur agreeing to allconditions. By means of this concession the placable creditors wereable to bring the dissatisfied creditors to reason. The deposit wasthen made, but not without sundry complaints.

　　"Your goodman," they said to des Grassins, "is tricking us."Twenty-three months after the death of Guillaume Grandet many of thecreditors, carried away by more pressing business in the markets ofParis, had forgotten their Grandet claims, or only thought of them tosay:

　　"I begin to believe that forty-seven per cent is all I shall ever getout of that affair."

　　The old cooper had calculated on the power of time, which, as he usedto say, is a pretty good devil after all. By the end of the third yeardes Grassins wrote to Grandet that he had brought the creditors toagree to give up their claims for ten per cent on the two million fourhundred thousand francs still due by the house of Grandet. Grandetanswered that the notary and the broker whose shameful failures hadcaused the death of his brother were still living, that they might nowhave recovered their credit, and that they ought to be sued, so as toget something out of them towards lessening the total of the deficit.By the end of the fourth year the liabilities were definitelyestimated at a sum of twelve hundred thousand francs. Manynegotiations, lasting over six months, took place between thecreditors and the liquidators, and between the liquidators andGrandet. To make a long story short, Grandet of Saumur, anxious bythis time to get out of the affair, told the liquidators, about theninth month of the fourth year, that his nephew had made a fortune inthe Indies and was disposed to pay his father's debts in full; hetherefore could not take upon himself to make any settlement withoutpreviously consulting him; he had written to him, and was expecting ananswer. The creditors were held in check until the middle of the fifthyear by the words, "payment in full," which the wily old miser threwout from time to time as he laughed in his beard, saying with a smileand an oath, "Those Parisians!"

　　But the creditors were reserved for a fate unexampled in the annals ofcommerce. When the events of this history bring them once more intonotice, they will be found still in the position Grandet had resolvedto force them into from the first.

　　As soon as the Funds reached a hundred and fifteen, Pere Grandet soldout his interests and withdrew two million four hundred thousandfrancs in gold, to which he added, in his coffers, the six hundredthousand francs compound interest which he had derived from thecapital. Des Grassins now lived in Paris. In the first place he hadbeen made a deputy; then he became infatuated (father of a family ashe was, though horribly bored by the provincial life of Saumur) with apretty actress at the Theatre de Madame, known as Florine, and hepresently relapsed into the old habits of his army life. It is uselessto speak of his conduct; Saumur considered it profoundly immoral. Hiswife was fortunate in the fact of her property being settled uponherself, and in having sufficient ability to keep up the banking-housein Saumur, which was managed in her name and repaired the breach inher fortune caused by the extravagance of her husband. The Cruchotinesmade so much talk about the false position of the quasi-widow that shemarried her daughter very badly, and was forced to give up all hope ofan alliance between Eugenie Grandet and her son. Adolphe joined hisfather in Paris and became, it was said, a worthless fellow. TheCruchots triumphed.

　　"Your husband hasn't common sense," said Grandet as he lent Madame desGrassins some money on a note securely endorsed. "I am very sorry foryou, for you are a good little woman."

　　"Ah, monsieur," said the poor lady, "who could have believed that whenhe left Saumur to go to Paris on your business he was going to hisruin?"

　　"Heaven is my witness, madame, that up to the last moment I did all Icould to prevent him from going. Monsieur le president was mostanxious to take his place; but he was determined to go, and now we allsee why."

　　In this way Grandet made it quite plain that he was under noobligation to des Grassins.

　　*****

　　In all situations women have more cause for suffering than men, andthey suffer more. Man has strength and the power of exercising it; heacts, moves, thinks, occupies himself; he looks ahead, and seesconsolation in the future. It was thus with Charles. But the womanstays at home; she is always face to face with the grief from whichnothing distracts her; she goes down to the depths of the abyss whichyawns before her, measures it, and often fills it with her tears andprayers. Thus did Eugenie. She initiated herself into her destiny. Tofeel, to love, to suffer, to devote herself,--is not this the sum ofwoman's life? Eugenie was to be in all things a woman, except in theone thing that consoles for all. Her happiness, picked up like nailsscattered on a wall--to use the fine simile of Bossuet--would never somuch as fill even the hollow of her hand. Sorrows are never long incoming; for her they came soon. The day after Charles's departure thehouse of Monsieur Grandet resumed its ordinary aspect in the eyes ofall, except in those of Eugenie, to whom it grew suddenly empty. Shewished, if it could be done unknown to her father, that Charles's roommight be kept as he had left it. Madame Grandet and Nanon were willingaccomplices in this /statu quo/.

　　"Who knows but he may come back sooner than we think for?" she said."Ah, don't I wish I could see him back!" answered Nanon. "I took tohim! He was such a dear, sweet young man,--pretty too, with his curlyhair." Eugenie looked at Nanon. "Holy Virgin! don't look at me thatway, mademoiselle; your eyes are like those of a lost soul."From that day the beauty of Mademoiselle Grandet took a new character.The solemn thoughts of love which slowly filled her soul, and thedignity of the woman beloved, gave to her features an illuminationsuch as painters render by a halo. Before the coming of her cousin,Eugenie might be compared to the Virgin before the conception; afterhe had gone, she was like the Virgin Mother,--she had given birth tolove. These two Marys so different, so well represented by Spanishart, embody one of those shining symbols with which Christianityabounds.

　　Returning from Mass on the morning after Charles's departure,--havingmade a vow to hear it daily,--Eugenie bought a map of the world, whichshe nailed up beside her looking-glass, that she might follow hercousin on his westward way, that she might put herself, were it everso little, day by day into the ship that bore him, and see him and askhim a thousand questions,--"Art thou well? Dost thou suffer? Dost thouthink of me when the star, whose beauty and usefulness thou hasttaught me to know, shines upon thee?" In the mornings she sat pensivebeneath the walnut-tree, on the worm-eaten bench covered with graylichens, where they had said to each other so many precious things, somany trifles, where they had built the pretty castles of their futurehome. She thought of the future now as she looked upward to the bit ofsky which was all the high walls suffered her to see; then she turnedher eyes to the angle where the sun crept on, and to the roof abovethe room in which he had slept. Hers was the solitary love, thepersistent love, which glides into every thought and becomes thesubstance, or, as our fathers might have said, the tissue of life.When the would-be friends of Pere Grandet came in the evening fortheir game at cards, she was gay and dissimulating; but all themorning she talked of Charles with her mother and Nanon. Nanon hadbrought herself to see that she could pity the sufferings of her youngmistress without failing in her duty to the old master, and she wouldsay to Eugenie,--

　　"If I had a man for myself I'd--I'd follow him to hell, yes, I'dexterminate myself for him; but I've none. I shall die and never knowwhat life is. Would you believe, mamz'elle, that old Cornoiller (agood fellow all the same) is always round my petticoats for the sakeof my money,--just for all the world like the rats who come smellingafter the master's cheese and paying court to you? I see it all; I'vegot a shrewd eye, though I am as big as a steeple. Well, mamz'elle, itpleases me, but it isn't love."

　　X

　　Two months went by. This domestic life, once so monotonous, was nowquickened with the intense interest of a secret that bound these womenintimately together. For them Charles lived and moved beneath the grimgray rafters of the hall. Night and morning Eugenie opened thedressing-case and gazed at the portrait of her aunt. One Sundaymorning her mother surprised her as she stood absorbed in finding hercousin's features in his mother's face. Madame Grandet was then forthe first time admitted into the terrible secret of the exchange madeby Charles against her daughter's treasure.

　　"You gave him all!" cried the poor mother, terrified. "What will yousay to your father on New Year's Day when he asks to see your gold?"Eugenie's eyes grew fixed, and the two women lived through mortalterror for more than half the morning. They were so troubled in mindthat they missed high Mass, and only went to the military service. Inthree days the year 1819 would come to an end. In three days aterrible drama would begin, a bourgeois tragedy, without poison, ordagger, or the spilling of blood; but--as regards the actors in it--more cruel than all the fabled horrors in the family of the Atrides."What will become of us?" said Madame Grandet to her daughter, lettingher knitting fall upon her knees.

　　The poor mother had gone through such anxiety for the past two monthsthat the woollen sleeves which she needed for the coming winter werenot yet finished. This domestic fact, insignificant as it seems, boresad results. For want of those sleeves, a chill seized her in themidst of a sweat caused by a terrible explosion of anger on the partof her husband.

　　"I have been thinking, my poor child, that if you had confided yoursecret to me we should have had time to write to Monsieur des Grassinsin Paris. He might have sent us gold pieces like yours; though Grandetknows them all, perhaps--"

　　"Where could we have got the money?"

　　"I would have pledged my own property. Besides, Monsieur des Grassinswould have--"

　　"It is too late," said Eugenie in a broken, hollow voice. "To-morrowmorning we must go and wish him a happy New Year in his chamber.""But, my daughter, why should I not consult the Cruchots?""No, no; it would be delivering me up to them, and putting ourselvesin their power. Besides, I have chosen my course. I have done right, Irepent of nothing. God will protect me. His will be done! Ah! mother,if you had read his letter, you, too, would have thought only of him."The next morning, January 1, 1820, the horrible fear to which motherand daughter were a prey suggested to their minds a natural excuse bywhich to escape the solemn entrance into Grandet's chamber. The winterof 1819-1820 was one of the coldest of that epoch. The snow encumberedthe roofs.

　　Madame Grandet called to her husband as soon as she heard him stirringin his chamber, and said,--

　　"Grandet, will you let Nanon light a fire here for me? The cold is sosharp that I am freezing under the bedclothes. At my age I need somecomforts. Besides," she added, after a slight pause, "Eugenie shallcome and dress here; the poor child might get an illness from dressingin her cold room in such weather. Then we will go and wish you a happyNew Year beside the fire in the hall."

　　"Ta, ta, ta, ta, what a tongue! a pretty way to begin the new year,Madame Grandet! You never talked so much before; but you haven't beensopping your bread in wine, I know that."

　　There was a moment's silence.

　　"Well," resumed the goodman, who no doubt had some reason of his ownfor agreeing to his wife's request, "I'll do what you ask, MadameGrandet. You are a good woman, and I don't want any harm to happen toyou at your time of life,--though as a general thing the Bertellieresare as sound as a roach. Hein! isn't that so?" he added after a pause."Well, I forgive them; we got their property in the end." And hecoughed.

　　"You are very gay this morning, monsieur," said the poor womangravely.

　　"I'm always gay,--

　　"'Gai, gai, gai, le tonnelier,

　　Raccommodez votre cuvier!'"

　　he answered, entering his wife's room fully dressed. "Yes, on my word,it is cold enough to freeze you solid. We shall have a fine breakfast,wife. Des Grassins has sent me a pate-de-foie-gras truffled! I amgoing now to get it at the coach-office. There'll be a double napoleonfor Eugenie in the package," he whispered in Madame Grandet's ear. "Ihave no gold left, wife. I had a few stray pieces--I don't mindtelling you that--but I had to let them go in business."

　　Then, by way of celebrating the new year, he kissed her on theforehead.

　　"Eugenie," cried the mother, when Grandet was fairly gone, "I don'tknow which side of the bed your father got out of, but he is good-tempered this morning. Perhaps we shall come out safe after all?""What's happened to the master?" said Nanon, entering her mistress'sroom to light the fire. "First place, he said, 'Good-morning; happyNew Year, you big fool! Go and light my wife's fire, she's cold'; andthen, didn't I feel silly when he held out his hand and gave me a six-franc piece, which isn't worn one bit? Just look at it, madame! Oh,the kind man! He is a good man, that's a fact. There are some peoplewho the older they get the harder they grow; but he,--why he's gettingsoft and improving with time, like your ratafia! He is a good, goodman--"

　　The secret of Grandet's joy lay in the complete success of hisspeculation. Monsieur des Grassins, after deducting the amount whichthe old cooper owed him for the discount on a hundred and fiftythousand francs in Dutch notes, and for the surplus which he hadadvanced to make up the sum required for the investment in the Fundswhich was to produce a hundred thousand francs a year, had now senthim, by the diligence, thirty thousand francs in silver coin, theremainder of his first half-year's interest, informing him at the sametime that the Funds had already gone up in value. They were thenquoted at eighty-nine; the shrewdest capitalists bought in, towardsthe last of January, at ninety-three. Grandet had thus gained in twomonths twelve per cent on his capital; he had simplified his accounts,and would in future receive fifty thousand francs interest every sixmonths, without incurring any taxes or costs for repairs. Heunderstood at last what it was to invest money in the publicsecurities,--a system for which provincials have always shown a markedrepugnance,--and at the end of five years he found himself master of acapital of six millions, which increased without much effort of hisown, and which, joined to the value and proceeds of his territorialpossessions, gave him a fortune that was absolutely colossal. The sixfrancs bestowed on Nanon were perhaps the reward of some great servicewhich the poor servant had rendered to her master unawares."Oh! oh! where's Pere Grandet going? He has been scurrying about sincesunrise as if to a fire," said the tradespeople to each other as theyopened their shops for the day.

　　When they saw him coming back from the wharf, followed by a porterfrom the coach-office wheeling a barrow which was laden with sacks,they all had their comments to make:--

　　"Water flows to the river; the old fellow was running after his gold,"said one.

　　"He gets it from Paris and Froidfond and Holland," said another."He'll end by buying up Saumur," cried a third.

　　"He doesn't mind the cold, he's so wrapped up in his gains," said awife to her husband.

　　"Hey! hey! Monsieur Grandet, if that's too heavy for you," said acloth-dealer, his nearest neighbor, "I'll take it off your hands.""Heavy?" said the cooper, "I should think so; it's all sous!""Silver sous," said the porter in a low voice.

　　"If you want me to take care of you, keep your tongue between yourteeth," said the goodman to the porter as they reached the door."The old fox! I thought he was deaf; seems he can hear fast enough infrosty weather."

　　"Here's twenty sous for your New Year, and /mum/!" said Grandet. "Beoff with you! Nanon shall take back your barrow. Nanon, are thelinnets at church?"

　　"Yes, monsieur."

　　"Then lend a hand! go to work!" he cried, piling the sacks upon her.In a few moments all were carried up to his inner room, where he shuthimself in with them. "When breakfast is ready, knock on the wall," hesaid as he disappeared. "Take the barrow back to the coach-office."The family did not breakfast that day until ten o'clock.

　　"Your father will not ask to see your gold downstairs," said MadameGrandet as they got back from Mass. "You must pretend to be verychilly. We may have time to replace the treasure before your fete-day."

　　Grandet came down the staircase thinking of his splendid speculationin government securities, and wondering how he could metamorphose hisParisian silver into solid gold; he was making up his mind to investin this way everything he could lay hands on until the Funds shouldreach a par value. Fatal reverie for Eugenie! As soon as he came in,the two women wished him a happy New Year,--his daughter by puttingher arms round his neck and caressing him; Madame Grandet gravely andwith dignity.

　　"Ha! ha! my child," he said, kissing his daughter on both cheeks. "Iwork for you, don't you see? I think of your happiness. Must havemoney to be happy. Without money there's not a particle of happiness.Here! there's a new napoleon for you. I sent to Paris for it. On myword of honor, it's all the gold I have; you are the only one that hasgot any gold. I want to see your gold, little one."

　　"Oh! it is too cold; let us have breakfast," answered Eugenie."Well, after breakfast, then; it will help the digestion. That fatdes Grassins sent me the pate. Eat as much as you like, my children,it costs nothing. Des Grassins is getting along very well. I amsatisfied with him. The old fish is doing Charles a good service, andgratis too. He is making a very good settlement of that poor deceasedGrandet's business. Hoo! hoo!" he muttered, with his mouth full, aftera pause, "how good it is! Eat some, wife; that will feed you for atleast two days."

　　"I am not hungry. I am very poorly; you know that."

　　"Ah, bah! you can stuff yourself as full as you please without danger,you're a Bertelliere; they are all hearty. You are a bit yellow,that's true; but I like yellow, myself."

　　The expectation of ignominious and public death is perhaps lesshorrible to a condemned criminal than the anticipation of what wascoming after breakfast to Madame Grandet and Eugenie. The moregleefully the old man talked and ate, the more their hearts shrankwithin them. The daughter, however, had an inward prop at this crisis,--she gathered strength through love.

　　"For him! for him!" she cried within her, "I would die a thousanddeaths."

　　At this thought, she shot a glance at her mother which flamed withcourage.

　　"Clear away," said Grandet to Nanon when, about eleven o'clock,breakfast was over, "but leave the table. We can spread your littletreasure upon it," he said, looking at Eugenie. "Little? Faith! no; itisn't little. You possess, in actual value, five thousand nine hundredand fifty-nine francs and the forty I gave you just now. That makessix thousand francs, less one. Well, now see here, little one! I'llgive you that one franc to make up the round number. Hey! what are youlistening for, Nanon? Mind your own business; go and do your work."Nanon disappeared.

　　"Now listen, Eugenie; you must give me back your gold. You won'trefuse your father, my little girl, hein?"

　　The two women were dumb.

　　"I have no gold myself. I had some, but it is all gone. I'll give youin return six thousand francs in /livres/, and you are to put themjust where I tell you. You mustn't think anything more about your'dozen.' When I marry you (which will be soon) I shall get you ahusband who can give you the finest 'dozen' ever seen in theprovinces. Now attend to me, little girl. There's a fine chance foryou; you can put your six thousand francs into government funds, andyou will receive every six months nearly two hundred francs interest,without taxes, or repairs, or frost, or hail, or floods, or anythingelse to swallow up the money. Perhaps you don't like to part with yourgold, hey, my girl? Never mind, bring it to me all the same. I'll getyou some more like it,--like those Dutch coins and the /portugaises/,the rupees of Mogul, and the /genovines/,--I'll give you some more onyour fete-days, and in three years you'll have got back half yourlittle treasure. What's that you say? Look up, now. Come, go and getit, the precious metal. You ought to kiss me on the eyelids fortelling you the secrets and the mysteries of the life and death ofmoney. Yes, silver and gold live and swarm like men; they come, andgo, and sweat, and multiply--"

　　Eugenie rose; but after making a few steps towards the door she turnedabruptly, looked her father in the face, and said,--

　　"I have not got /my/ gold."

　　"You have not got your gold!" cried Grandet, starting up erect, like ahorse that hears a cannon fired beside him.

　　"No, I have not got it."

　　"You are mistaken, Eugenie."

　　"No."

　　"By the shears of my father!"

　　Whenever the old man swore that oath the rafters trembled."Holy Virgin! Madame is turning pale," cried Nanon.

　　"Grandet, your anger will kill me," said the poor mother."Ta, ta, ta, ta! nonsense; you never die in your family! Eugenie, whathave you done with your gold?" he cried, rushing upon her."Monsieur," said the daughter, falling at Madame Grandet's knees, "mymother is ill. Look at her; do not kill her."

　　Grandet was frightened by the pallor which overspread his wife's face,usually so yellow.

　　"Nanon, help me to bed," said the poor woman in a feeble voice; "I amdying--"

　　Nanon gave her mistress an arm, Eugenie gave her another; but it wasonly with infinite difficulty that they could get her upstairs, shefell with exhaustion at every step. Grandet remained alone. However,in a few moments he went up six or eight stairs and called out,--"Eugenie, when your mother is in bed, come down."

　　"Yes, father."

　　She soon came, after reassuring her mother.

　　"My daughter," said Grandet, "you will now tell me what you have donewith your gold."

　　"My father, if you make me presents of which I am not the solemistress, take them back," she answered coldly, picking up thenapoleon from the chimney-piece and offering it to him.

　　Grandet seized the coin and slipped it into his breeches' pocket."I shall certainly never give you anything again. Not so much asthat!" he said, clicking his thumb-nail against a front tooth. "Do youdare to despise your father? have you no confidence in him? Don't youknow what a father is? If he is nothing for you, he is nothing at all.Where is your gold?"

　　"Father, I love and respect you, in spite of your anger; but I humblyask you to remember that I am twenty-three years old. You have told meoften that I have attained my majority, and I do not forget it. I haveused my money as I chose to use it, and you may be sure that it wasput to a good use--"

　　"What use?"

　　"That is an inviolable secret," she answered. "Have you no secrets?""I am the head of the family; I have my own affairs."

　　"And this is mine."

　　"It must be something bad if you can't tell it to your father,Mademoiselle Grandet."

　　"It is good, and I cannot tell it to my father."

　　"At least you can tell me when you parted with your gold?"Eugenie made a negative motion with her head.

　　"You had it on your birthday, hein?"

　　She grew as crafty through love as her father was through avarice, andreiterated the negative sign.

　　"Was there ever such obstinacy! It's a theft," cried Grandet, hisvoice going up in a crescendo which gradually echoed through thehouse. "What! here, in my own home, under my very eyes, somebody hastaken your gold!--the only gold we have!--and I'm not to know who hasgot it! Gold is a precious thing. Virtuous girls go wrong sometimes,and give--I don't know what; they do it among the great people, andeven among the bourgeoisie. But give their gold!--for you have givenit to some one, hein?--"

　　Eugenie was silent and impassive.

　　"Was there ever such a daughter? Is it possible that I am your father?If you have invested it anywhere, you must have a receipt--""Was I free--yes or no--to do what I would with my own? Was it notmine?"

　　"You are a child."

　　"Of age."

　　Dumbfounded by his daughter's logic, Grandet turned pale and stampedand swore. When at last he found words, he cried: "Serpent! Cursedgirl! Ah, deceitful creature! You know I love you, and you takeadvantage of it. She'd cut her father's throat! Good God! you've givenour fortune to that ne'er-do-well,--that dandy with morocco boots! Bythe shears of my father! I can't disinherit you, but I curse you,--youand your cousin and your children! Nothing good will come of it! Doyou hear? If it was to Charles--but, no; it's impossible. What! hasthat wretched fellow robbed me?--"

　　He looked at his daughter, who continued cold and silent."She won't stir; she won't flinch! She's more Grandet than I'mGrandet! Ha! you have not given your gold for nothing? Come, speak thetruth!"

　　Eugenie looked at her father with a sarcastic expression that stunghim.

　　"Eugenie, you are here, in my house,--in your father's house. If youwish to stay here, you must submit yourself to me. The priests tellyou to obey me." Eugenie bowed her head. "You affront me in all I holdmost dear. I will not see you again until you submit. Go to yourchamber. You will stay there till I give you permission to leave it.Nanon will bring you bread and water. You hear me--go!"

　　Eugenie burst into tears and fled up to her mother. Grandet, aftermarching two or three times round the garden in the snow withoutheeding the cold, suddenly suspected that his daughter had gone to hermother; only too happy to find her disobedient to his orders, heclimbed the stairs with the agility of a cat and appeared in MadameGrandet's room just as she was stroking Eugenie's hair, while thegirl's face was hidden in her motherly bosom.

　　"Be comforted, my poor child," she was saying; "your father will getover it."

　　"She has no father!" said the old man. "Can it be you and I, MadameGrandet, who have given birth to such a disobedient child? A fineeducation,--religious, too! Well! why are you not in your chamber?Come, to prison, to prison, mademoiselle!"

　　"Would you deprive me of my daughter, monsieur?" said Madame Grandet,turning towards him a face that was now red with fever.

　　"If you want to keep her, carry her off! Clear out--out of my house,both of you! Thunder! where is the gold? what's become of the gold?"Eugenie rose, looked proudly at her father, and withdrew to her room.Grandet turned the key of the door.

　　"Nanon," he cried, "put out the fire in the hall."

　　Then he sat down in an armchair beside his wife's fire and said toher,--

　　"Undoubtedly she has given the gold to that miserable seducer,Charles, who only wanted our money."

　　"I knew nothing about it," she answered, turning to the other side ofthe bed, that she might escape the savage glances of her husband. "Isuffer so much from your violence that I shall never leave this room,if I trust my own presentiments, till I am carried out of it in mycoffin. You ought to have spared me this suffering, monsieur,--you, towhom I have caused no pain; that is, I think so. Your daughter lovesyou. I believe her to be as innocent as the babe unborn. Do not makeher wretched. Revoke your sentence. The cold is very severe; you maygive her some serious illness."

　　"I will not see her, neither will I speak to her. She shall stay inher room, on bread and water, until she submits to her father. Whatthe devil! shouldn't a father know where the gold in his house hasgone to? She owned the only rupees in France, perhaps, and the Dutchducats and the /genovines/--"

　　"Monsieur, Eugenie is our only child; and even if she had thrown theminto the water--"

　　"Into the water!" cried her husband; "into the water! You are crazy,Madame Grandet! What I have said is said; you know that well enough.If you want peace in this household, make your daughter confess, pumpit out of her. Women understand how to do that better than we do.Whatever she has done, I sha'n't eat her. Is she afraid of me? Even ifshe has plastered Charles with gold from head to foot, he is on thehigh seas, and nobody can get at him, hein!"

　　"But, monsieur--" Excited by the nervous crisis through which she hadpassed, and by the fate of her daughter, which brought forth all hertenderness and all her powers of mind, Madame Grandet suddenlyobserved a frightful movement of her husband's wen, and, in the veryact of replying, she changed her speech without changing the tones ofher voice,--"But, monsieur, I have not more influence over her thanyou have. She has said nothing to me; she takes after you.""Tut, tut! Your tongue is hung in the middle this morning. Ta, ta, ta,ta! You are setting me at defiance, I do believe. I daresay you are inleague with her."

　　He looked fixedly at his wife.

　　"Monsieur Grandet, if you wish to kill me, you have only to go on likethis. I tell you, monsieur,--and if it were to cost me my life, Iwould say it,--you do wrong by your daughter; she is more in the rightthan you are. That money belonged to her; she is incapable of makingany but a good use of it, and God alone has the right to know our gooddeeds. Monsieur, I implore you, take Eugenie back into favor; forgiveher. If you will do this you will lessen the injury your anger hasdone me; perhaps you will save my life. My daughter! oh, monsieur,give me back my daughter!"

　　"I shall decamp," he said; "the house is not habitable. A mother anddaughter talking and arguing like that! Broooouh! Pouah! A fine NewYear's present you've made me, Eugenie," he called out. "Yes, yes, cryaway! What you've done will bring you remorse, do you hear? What's thegood of taking the sacrament six times every three months, if you giveaway your father's gold secretly to an idle fellow who'll eat yourheart out when you've nothing else to give him? You'll find out someday what your Charles is worth, with his morocco boots andsupercilious airs. He has got neither heart nor soul if he dared tocarry off a young girl's treasure without the consent of her parents."When the street-door was shut, Eugenie came out of her room and wentto her mother.

　　"What courage you have had for your daughter's sake!" she said."Ah! my child, see where forbidden things may lead us. You forced meto tell a lie."

　　"I will ask God to punish only me."

　　"Is it true," cried Nanon, rushing in alarmed, "that mademoiselle isto be kept on bread and water for the rest of her life?"

　　"What does that signify, Nanon?" said Eugenie tranquilly."Goodness! do you suppose I'll eat /frippe/ when the daughter of thehouse is eating dry bread? No, no!"

　　"Don't say a word about all this, Nanon," said Eugenie.

　　"I'll be as mute as a fish; but you'll see!"

　　*****

　　Grandet dined alone for the first time in twenty-four years."So you're a widower, monsieur," said Nanon; "it must be disagreeableto be a widower with two women in the house."

　　"I did not speak to you. Hold your jaw, or I'll turn you off! What isthat I hear boiling in your saucepan on the stove?"

　　"It is grease I'm trying out."

　　"There will be some company to-night. Light the fire."

　　The Cruchots, Madame des Grassins, and her son arrived at the usualhour of eight, and were surprised to see neither Madame Grandet norher daughter.

　　"My wife is not very well, and Eugenie is with her," said the oldwine-grower, whose face betrayed no emotion.

　　At the end of an hour spent in idle conversation, Madame des Grassins,who had gone up to see Madame Grandet, came down, and every oneinquired,--

　　"How is Madame Grandet?"

　　"Not at all well," she answered; "her condition seems to me reallyalarming. At her age you ought to take every precaution, PapaGrandet."

　　"We'll see about it," said the old man in an absent way.

　　They all wished him good-night. When the Cruchots got into the streetMadame des Grassins said to them,--

　　"There is something going on at the Grandets. The mother is very illwithout her knowing it. The girl's eyes are red, as if she had beencrying all day. Can they be trying to marry her against her will?"*****

　　When Grandet had gone to bed Nanon came softly to Eugenie's room inher stockinged feet and showed her a pate baked in a saucepan."See, mademoiselle," said the good soul, "Cornoiller gave me a hare.You eat so little that this pate will last you full a week; in suchfrosty weather it won't spoil. You sha'n't live on dry bread, I'mdetermined; it isn't wholesome."

　　"Poor Nanon!" said Eugenie, pressing her hand.

　　"I've made it downright good and dainty, and /he/ never found it out.I bought the lard and the spices out of my six francs: I'm themistress of my own money"; and she disappeared rapidly, fancying sheheard Grandet.

　　XI

　　For several months the old wine-grower came constantly to his wife'sroom at all hours of the day, without ever uttering his daughter'sname, or seeing her, or making the smallest allusion to her. MadameGrandet did not leave her chamber, and daily grew worse. Nothingsoftened the old man; he remained unmoved, harsh, and cold as agranite rock. He continued to go and come about his business as usual;but ceased to stutter, talked less, and was more obdurate in businesstransactions than ever before. Often he made mistakes in adding up hisfigures.

　　"Something is going on at the Grandets," said the Grassinists and theCruchotines.

　　"What has happened in the Grandet family?" became a fixed questionwhich everybody asked everybody else at the little evening-parties ofSaumur. Eugenie went to Mass escorted by Nanon. If Madame des Grassinssaid a few words to her on coming out of church, she answered in anevasive manner, without satisfying any curiosity. However, at the endof two months, it became impossible to hide, either from the threeCruchots or from Madame des Grassins, the fact that Eugenie was inconfinement. There came a moment when all pretexts failed to explainher perpetual absence. Then, though it was impossible to discover bywhom the secret had been betrayed, all the town became aware that eversince New Year's day Mademoiselle Grandet had been kept in her roomwithout fire, on bread and water, by her father's orders, and thatNanon cooked little dainties and took them to her secretly at night.It was even known that the young woman was not able to see or takecare of her mother, except at certain times when her father was out ofthe house.

　　Grandet's conduct was severely condemned. The whole town outlawed him,so to speak; they remembered his treachery, his hard-heartedness, andthey excommunicated him. When he passed along the streets, peoplepointed him out and muttered at him. When his daughter came down thewinding street, accompanied by Nanon, on her way to Mass or Vespers,the inhabitants ran to the windows and examined with intense curiositythe bearing of the rich heiress and her countenance, which bore theimpress of angelic gentleness and melancholy. Her imprisonment and thecondemnation of her father were as nothing to her. Had she not a mapof the world, the little bench, the garden, the angle of the wall? Didshe not taste upon her lips the honey that love's kisses left there?She was ignorant for a time that the town talked about her, just asGrandet himself was ignorant of it. Pious and pure in heart beforeGod, her conscience and her love helped her to suffer patiently thewrath and vengeance of her father.

　　One deep grief silenced all others. Her mother, that gentle, tendercreature, made beautiful by the light which shone from the inner tothe outer as she approached the tomb,--her mother was perishing fromday to day. Eugenie often reproached herself as the innocent cause ofthe slow, cruel malady that was wasting her away. This remorse, thoughher mother soothed it, bound her still closer to her love. Everymorning, as soon as her father left the house, she went to the bedsideof her mother, and there Nanon brought her breakfast. The poor girl,sad, and suffering through the sufferings of her mother, would turnher face to the old servant with a mute gesture, weeping, and yet notdaring to speak of her cousin. It was Madame Grandet who first foundcourage to say,--

　　"Where is /he/? Why does /he/ not write?"

　　"Let us think about him, mother, but not speak of him. You are ill--you, before all."

　　"All" meant "him."

　　"My child," said Madame Grandet, "I do not wish to live. God protectsme and enables me to look with joy to the end of my misery."Every utterance of this woman was unfalteringly pious and Christian.Sometimes, during the first months of the year, when her husband cameto breakfast with her and tramped up and down the room, she would sayto him a few religious words, always spoken with angelic sweetness,yet with the firmness of a woman to whom approaching death lends acourage she had lacked in life.

　　"Monsieur, I thank you for the interest you take in my health," shewould answer when he made some commonplace inquiry; "but if you reallydesire to render my last moments less bitter and to ease my grief,take back your daughter: be a Christian, a husband, and a father."When he heard these words, Grandet would sit down by the bed with theair of a man who sees the rain coming and quietly gets under theshelter of a gateway till it is over. When these touching, tender, andreligious supplications had all been made, he would say,--"You are rather pale to-day, my poor wife."

　　Absolute forgetfulness of his daughter seemed graven on his stonybrow, on his closed lips. He was unmoved by the tears which floweddown the white cheeks of his unhappy wife as she listened to hismeaningless answers.

　　"May God pardon you," she said, "even as I pardon you! You will someday stand in need of mercy."

　　Since Madame Grandet's illness he had not dared to make use of histerrible "Ta, ta, ta, ta!" Yet, for all that, his despotic nature wasnot disarmed by this angel of gentleness, whose ugliness day by daydecreased, driven out by the ineffable expression of moral qualitieswhich shone upon her face. She was all soul. The spirit of prayerseemed to purify her and refine those homely features and make themluminous. Who has not seen the phenomenon of a like transfiguration onsacred faces where the habits of the soul have triumphed over theplainest features, giving them that spiritual illumination whose lightcomes from the purity and nobility of the inward thought? Thespectacle of this transformation wrought by the struggle whichconsumed the last shreds of the human life of this woman, did somewhataffect the old cooper, though feebly, for his nature was of iron; ifhis language ceased to be contemptuous, an imperturbable silence,which saved his dignity as master of the household, took its place andruled his conduct.

　　When the faithful Nanon appeared in the market, many quips and quirksand complaints about the master whistled in her ears; but howeverloudly public opinion condemned Monsieur Grandet, the old servantdefended him, for the honor of the family.

　　"Well!" she would say to his detractors, "don't we all get hard as wegrow old? Why shouldn't he get horny too? Stop telling lies.Mademoiselle lives like a queen. She's alone, that's true; but shelikes it. Besides, my masters have good reasons."

　　At last, towards the end of spring, Madame Grandet, worn out by griefeven more than by illness, having failed, in spite of her prayers, toreconcile the father and daughter, confided her secret troubles to theCruchots.

　　"Keep a girl of twenty-three on bread and water!" cried Monsieur deBonfons; "without any reason, too! Why, that constitutes wrongfulcruelty; she can contest, as much in as upon--"

　　"Come, nephew, spare us your legal jargon," said the notary. "Set yourmind at ease, madame; I will put a stop to such treatment to-morrow."Eugenie, hearing herself mentioned, came out of her room."Gentlemen," she said, coming forward with a proud step, "I beg younot to interfere in this matter. My father is master in his own house.As long as I live under his roof I am bound to obey him. His conductis not subject to the approbation or the disapprobation of the world;he is accountable to God only. I appeal to your friendship to keeptotal silence in this affair. To blame my father is to attack ourfamily honor. I am much obliged to you for the interest you have shownin me; you will do me an additional service if you will put a stop tothe offensive rumors which are current in the town, of which I amaccidentally informed."

　　"She is right," said Madame Grandet.

　　"Mademoiselle, the best way to stop such rumors is to procure yourliberty," answered the old notary respectfully, struck with the beautywhich seclusion, melancholy, and love had stamped upon her face."Well, my daughter, let Monsieur Cruchot manage the matter if he is sosure of success. He understands your father, and how to manage him. Ifyou wish to see me happy for my few remaining days, you must, at anycost, be reconciled to your father."

　　On the morrow Grandet, in pursuance of a custom he had begun sinceEugenie's imprisonment, took a certain number of turns up and down thelittle garden; he had chosen the hour when Eugenie brushed andarranged her hair. When the old man reached the walnut-tree he hidbehind its trunk and remained for a few moments watching hisdaughter's movements, hesitating, perhaps, between the course to whichthe obstinacy of his character impelled him and his natural desire toembrace his child. Sometimes he sat down on the rotten old bench whereCharles and Eugenie had vowed eternal love; and then she, too, lookedat her father secretly in the mirror before which she stood. If herose and continued his walk, she sat down obligingly at the window andlooked at the angle of the wall where the pale flowers hung, where theVenus-hair grew from the crevices with the bindweed and the sedum,--awhite or yellow stone-crop very abundant in the vineyards of Saumurand at Tours. Maitre Cruchot came early, and found the old wine-growersitting in the fine June weather on the little bench, his back againstthe division wall of the garden, engaged in watching his daughter."What may you want, Maitre Cruchot?" he said, perceiving the notary."I came to speak to you on business."

　　"Ah! ah! have you brought some gold in exchange for my silver?""No, no, I have not come about money; it is about your daughterEugenie. All the town is talking of her and you."

　　"What does the town meddle for? A man's house is his castle.""Very true; and a man may kill himself if he likes, or, what is worse,he may fling his money into the gutter."

　　"What do you mean?"

　　"Why, your wife is very ill, my friend. You ought to consult MonsieurBergerin; she is likely to die. If she does die without receivingproper care, you will not be very easy in mind, I take it.""Ta, ta, ta, ta! you know a deal about my wife! These doctors, if theyonce get their foot in your house, will come five and six times aday."

　　"Of course you will do as you think best. We are old friends; there isno one in all Saumur who takes more interest than I in what concernsyou. Therefore, I was bound to tell you this. However, happen whatmay, you have the right to do as you please; you can choose your owncourse. Besides, that is not what brings me here. There is anotherthing which may have serious results for you. After all, you can'twish to kill your wife; her life is too important to you. Think ofyour situation in connection with your daughter if Madame Grandetdies. You must render an account to Eugenie, because you enjoy yourwife's estate only during her lifetime. At her death your daughter canclaim a division of property, and she may force you to sell Froidfond.In short, she is her mother's heir, and you are not."

　　These words fell like a thunderbolt on the old man, who was not aswise about law as he was about business. He had never thought of alegal division of the estate.

　　"Therefore I advise you to treat her kindly," added Cruchot, inconclusion.

　　"But do you know what she has done, Cruchot?"

　　"What?" asked the notary, curious to hear the truth and find out thecause of the quarrel.

　　"She has given away her gold!"

　　"Well, wasn't it hers?" said the notary.

　　"They all tell me that!" exclaimed the old man, letting his arms fallto his sides with a movement that was truly tragic.

　　"Are you going--for a mere nothing,"--resumed Cruchot, "to putobstacles in the way of the concessions which you will be obliged toask from your daughter as soon as her mother dies?"

　　"Do you call six thousand francs a mere nothing?"

　　"Hey! my old friend, do you know what the inventory of your wife'sproperty will cost, if Eugenie demands the division?"

　　"How much?"

　　"Two, three, four thousand francs, perhaps! The property would have tobe put up at auction and sold, to get at its actual value. Instead ofthat, if you are on good terms with--"

　　"By the shears of my father!" cried Grandet, turning pale as hesuddenly sat down, "we will see about it, Cruchot."

　　After a moment's silence, full of anguish perhaps, the old man lookedat the notary and said,--

　　"Life is very hard! It has many griefs! Cruchot," he continuedsolemnly, "you would not deceive me? Swear to me upon your honor thatall you've told me is legally true. Show me the law; I must see thelaw!"

　　"My poor friend," said the notary, "don't I know my own business?""Then it is true! I am robbed, betrayed, killed, destroyed by my owndaughter!"

　　"It is true that your daughter is her mother's heir."

　　"Why do we have children? Ah! my wife, I love her! Luckily she's soundand healthy; she's a Bertelliere."

　　"She has not a month to live."

　　Grandet struck his forehead, went a few steps, came back, cast adreadful look on Cruchot, and said,--

　　"What can be done?"

　　"Eugenie can relinquish her claim to her mother's property. Should shedo this you would not disinherit her, I presume?--but if you want tocome to such a settlement, you must not treat her harshly. What I amtelling you, old man, is against my own interests. What do I live by,if it isn't liquidations, inventories, conveyances, divisions ofproperty?--"

　　"We'll see, we'll see! Don't let's talk any more about it, Cruchot; itwrings my vitals. Have you received any gold?"

　　"No; but I have a few old louis, a dozen or so, which you may have. Mygood friend, make it up with Eugenie. Don't you know all Saumur ispelting you with stones?"

　　"The scoundrels!"

　　"Come, the Funds are at ninety-nine. Do be satisfied for once in yourlife."

　　"At ninety-nine! Are they, Cruchot?"

　　"Yes."

　　"Hey, hey! Ninety-nine!" repeated the old man, accompanying the notaryto the street-door. Then, too agitated by what he had just heard tostay in the house, he went up to his wife's room and said,--"Come, mother, you may have your daughter to spend the day with you.I'm going to Froidfond. Enjoy yourselves, both of you. This is ourwedding-day, wife. See! here are sixty francs for your altar at theFete-Dieu; you've wanted one for a long time. Come, cheer up, enjoyyourself, and get well! Hurrah for happiness!"

　　He threw ten silver pieces of six francs each upon the bed, and tookhis wife's head between his hands and kissed her forehead."My good wife, you are getting well, are not you?"

　　"How can you think of receiving the God of mercy in your house whenyou refuse to forgive your daughter?" she said with emotion."Ta, ta, ta, ta!" said Grandet in a coaxing voice. "We'll see aboutthat."

　　"Merciful heaven! Eugenie," cried the mother, flushing with joy, "comeand kiss your father; he forgives you!"

　　But the old man had disappeared. He was going as fast as his legscould carry him towards his vineyards, trying to get his confusedideas into order. Grandet had entered his seventy-sixth year. Duringthe last two years his avarice had increased upon him, as all thepersistent passions of men increase at a certain age. As if toillustrate an observation which applies equally to misers, ambitiousmen, and others whose lives are controlled by any dominant idea, hisaffections had fastened upon one special symbol of his passion. Thesight of gold, the possession of gold, had become a monomania. Hisdespotic spirit had grown in proportion to his avarice, and to partwith the control of the smallest fraction of his property at the deathof his wife seemed to him a thing "against nature." To declare hisfortune to his daughter, to give an inventory of his property, landedand personal, for the purposes of division--

　　"Why," he cried aloud in the midst of a field where he was pretendingto examine a vine, "it would be cutting my throat!"

　　He came at last to a decision, and returned to Saumur in time fordinner, resolved to unbend to Eugenie, and pet and coax her, that hemight die regally, holding the reins of his millions in his own handsso long as the breath was in his body. At the moment when the old man,who chanced to have his pass-key in his pocket, opened the door andclimbed with a stealthy step up the stairway to go into his wife'sroom, Eugenie had brought the beautiful dressing-case from the oakcabinet and placed it on her mother's bed. Mother and daughter, inGrandet's absence, allowed themselves the pleasure of looking for alikeness to Charles in the portrait of his mother.

　　"It is exactly his forehead and his mouth," Eugenie was saying as theold man opened the door. At the look which her husband cast upon thegold, Madame Grandet cried out,--

　　"O God, have pity upon us!"

　　The old man sprang upon the box as a famished tiger might spring upona sleeping child.

　　"What's this?" he said, snatching the treasure and carrying it to thewindow. "Gold, good gold!" he cried. "All gold,--it weighs two pounds!Ha, ha! Charles gave you that for your money, did he? Hein! Why didn'tyou tell me so? It was a good bargain, little one! Yes, you are mydaughter, I see that--" Eugenie trembled in every limb. "This camefrom Charles, of course, didn't it?" continued the old man."Yes, father; it is not mine. It is a sacred trust."

　　"Ta, ta, ta, ta! He took your fortune, and now you can get it back.""Father!"

　　Grandet took his knife to pry out some of the gold; to do this, heplaced the dressing-case on a chair. Eugenie sprang forward to recoverit; but her father, who had his eye on her and on the treasure too,pushed her back so violently with a thrust of his arm that she fellupon her mother's bed.

　　"Monsieur, monsieur!" cried the mother, lifting herself up.Grandet had opened his knife, and was about to apply it to the gold."Father!" cried Eugenie, falling on her knees and dragging herselfclose to him with clasped hands, "father, in the name of all thesaints and the Virgin! in the name of Christ who died upon the cross!in the name of your eternal salvation, father! for my life's sake,father!--do not touch that! It is neither yours nor mine. It is atrust placed in my hands by an unhappy relation: I must give it backto him uninjured!"

　　"If it is a trust, why were you looking at it? To look at it is as badas touching it."

　　"Father, don't destroy it, or you will disgrace me! Father, do youhear?"

　　"Oh, have pity!" said the mother.

　　"Father!" cried Eugenie in so startling a voice that Nanon ranupstairs terrified. Eugenie sprang upon a knife that was close athand.

　　"Well, what now?" said Grandet coldly, with a callous smile."Oh, you are killing me!" said the mother.

　　"Father, if your knife so much as cuts a fragment of that gold, I willstab myself with this one! You have already driven my mother to herdeath; you will now kill your child! Do as you choose! Wound forwound!"

　　Grandet held his knife over the dressing-case and hesitated as helooked at his daughter.

　　"Are you capable of doing it, Eugenie?" he said.

　　"Yes, yes!" said the mother.

　　"She'll do it if she says so!" cried Nanon. "Be reasonable, monsieur,for once in your life."

　　The old man looked at the gold and then at his daughter alternatelyfor an instant. Madame Grandet fainted.

　　"There! don't you see, monsieur, that madame is dying?" cried Nanon."Come, come, my daughter, we won't quarrel for a box! Here, take it!"he cried hastily, flinging the case upon the bed. "Nanon, go and fetchMonsieur Bergerin! Come, mother," said he, kissing his wife's hand,"it's all over! There! we've made up--haven't we, little one? No moredry bread; you shall have all you want--Ah, she opens her eyes! Well,mother, little mother, come! See, I'm kissing Eugenie! She loves hercousin, and she may marry him if she wants to; she may keep his case.But don't die, mother; live a long time yet, my poor wife! Come, tryto move! Listen! you shall have the finest altar that ever was made inSaumur."

　　"Oh, how can you treat your wife and daughter so!" said Madame Grandetin a feeble voice.

　　"I won't do so again, never again," cried her husband; "you shall see,my poor wife!" He went to his inner room and returned with a handfulof louis, which he scattered on the bed. "Here, Eugenie! see, wife!all these are for you," he said, fingering the coins. "Come, be happy,wife! feel better, get well; you sha'n't want for anything, norEugenie either. Here's a hundred /louis d'or/ for her. You won't givethese away, will you, Eugenie, hein?"

　　Madame Grandet and her daughter looked at each other in astonishment."Take back your money, father; we ask for nothing but your affection.""Well, well, that's right!" he said, pocketing the coins; "let's begood friends! We will all go down to dinner to-day, and we'll playloto every evening for two sous. You shall both be happy. Hey, wife?""Alas! I wish I could, if it would give you pleasure," said the dyingwoman; "but I cannot rise from my bed."

　　"Poor mother," said Grandet, "you don't know how I love you! and youtoo, my daughter!" He took her in his arms and kissed her. "Oh, howgood it is to kiss a daughter when we have been angry with her! There,mother, don't you see it's all over now? Go and put that away,Eugenie," he added, pointing to the case. "Go, don't be afraid! Ishall never speak of it again, never!"

　　Monsieur Bergerin, the celebrated doctor of Saumur, presently arrived.After an examination, he told Grandet positively that his wife wasvery ill; but that perfect peace of mind, a generous diet, and greatcare might prolong her life until the autumn.

　　"Will all that cost much?" said the old man. "Will she needmedicines?"

　　"Not much medicine, but a great deal of care," answered the doctor,who could scarcely restrain a smile.

　　"Now, Monsieur Bergerin," said Grandet, "you are a man of honor, arenot you? I trust to you! Come and see my wife how and when you thinknecessary. Save my good wife! I love her,--don't you see?--though Inever talk about it; I keep things to myself. I'm full of trouble.Troubles began when my brother died; I have to spend enormous sums onhis affairs in Paris. Why, I'm paying through my nose; there's no endto it. Adieu, monsieur! If you can save my wife, save her. I'll spareno expense, not even if it costs me a hundred or two hundred francs."In spite of Grandet's fervent wishes for the health of his wife, whosedeath threatened more than death to him; in spite of the considerationhe now showed on all occasions for the least wish of his astonishedwife and daughter; in spite of the tender care which Eugenie lavishedupon her mother,--Madame Grandet rapidly approached her end. Every dayshe grew weaker and wasted visibly, as women of her age when attackedby serious illness are wont to do. She was fragile as the foliage inautumn; the radiance of heaven shone through her as the sun strikesathwart the withering leaves and gilds them. It was a death worthy ofher life,--a Christian death; and is not that sublime? In the month ofOctober, 1822, her virtues, her angelic patience, her love for herdaughter, seemed to find special expression; and then she passed awaywithout a murmur. Lamb without spot, she went to heaven, regrettingonly the sweet companion of her cold and dreary life, for whom herlast glance seemed to prophesy a destiny of sorrows. She shrank fromleaving her ewe-lamb, white as herself, alone in the midst of aselfish world that sought to strip her of her fleece and grasp hertreasures.

　　"My child," she said as she expired, "there is no happiness except inheaven; you will know it some day."

　　XII

　　On the morrow of this death Eugenie felt a new motive for attachmentto the house in which she was born, where she had suffered so much,where her mother had just died. She could not see the window and thechair on its castors without weeping. She thought she had mistaken theheart of her old father when she found herself the object of histenderest cares. He came in the morning and gave her his arm to takeher to breakfast; he looked at her for hours together with an eye thatwas almost kind; he brooded over her as though she had been gold. Theold man was so unlike himself, he trembled so often before hisdaughter, that Nanon and the Cruchotines, who witnessed his weakness,attributed it to his great age, and feared that his faculties weregiving away. But the day on which the family put on their mourning,and after dinner, to which meal Maitre Cruchot (the only person whoknew his secret) had been invited, the conduct of the old miser wasexplained.

　　"My dear child," he said to Eugenie when the table had been clearedand the doors carefully shut, "you are now your mother's heiress, andwe have a few little matters to settle between us. Isn't that so,Cruchot?"

　　"Yes."

　　"Is it necessary to talk of them to-day, father?"

　　"Yes, yes, little one; I can't bear the uncertainty in which I'mplaced. I think you don't want to give me pain?"

　　"Oh! father--"

　　"Well, then! let us settle it all to-night."

　　"What is it you wish me to do?"

　　"My little girl, it is not for me to say. Tell her, Cruchot.""Mademoiselle, your father does not wish to divide the property, norsell the estate, nor pay enormous taxes on the ready money which hemay possess. Therefore, to avoid all this, he must be released frommaking the inventory of his whole fortune, part of which you inheritfrom your mother, and which is now undivided between you and yourfather--"

　　"Cruchot, are you quite sure of what you are saying before you tell itto a mere child?"

　　"Let me tell it my own way, Grandet."

　　"Yes, yes, my friend. Neither you nor my daughter wish to rob me,--doyou, little one?"

　　"But, Monsieur Cruchot, what am I to do?" said Eugenie impatiently."Well," said the notary, "it is necessary to sign this deed, by whichyou renounce your rights to your mother's estate and leave your fatherthe use and disposition, during his lifetime, of all the propertyundivided between you, of which he guarantees you the capital.""I do not understand a word of what you are saying," returned Eugenie;"give me the deed, and show me where I am to sign it."

　　Pere Grandet looked alternately at the deed and at his daughter, athis daughter and at the deed, undergoing as he did so such violentemotion that he wiped the sweat from his brow.

　　"My little girl," he said, "if, instead of signing this deed, whichwill cost a great deal to record, you would simply agree to renounceyour rights as heir to your poor dear, deceased mother's property, andwould trust to me for the future, I should like it better. In thatcase I will pay you monthly the good round sum of a hundred francs.See, now, you could pay for as many masses as you want for anybody--Hein! a hundred francs a month--in /livres/?"

　　"I will do all you wish, father."

　　"Mademoiselle," said the notary, "it is my duty to point out to youthat you are despoiling yourself without guarantee--"

　　"Good heavens! what is all that to me?"

　　"Hold your tongue, Cruchot! It's settled, all settled," cried Grandet,taking his daughter's hand and striking it with his own. "Eugenie, youwon't go back on your word?--you are an honest girl, hein?""Oh! father!--"

　　He kissed her effusively, and pressed her in his arms till he almostchoked her.

　　"Go, my good child, you restore your father's life; but you onlyreturn to him that which he gave you: we are quits. This is howbusiness should be done. Life is a business. I bless you! you are avirtuous girl, and you love your father. Do just what you like infuture. To-morrow, Cruchot," he added, looking at the horrifiednotary, "you will see about preparing the deed of relinquishment, andthen enter it on the records of the court."

　　The next morning Eugenie signed the papers by which she herselfcompleted her spoliation. At the end of the first year, however, inspite of his bargain, the old man had not given his daughter one souof the hundred francs he had so solemnly pledged to her. When Eugeniepleasantly reminded him of this, he could not help coloring, and wenthastily to his secret hiding-place, from whence he brought down abouta third of the jewels he had taken from his nephew, and gave them toher.

　　"There, little one," he said in a sarcastic tone, "do you want thosefor your twelve hundred francs?"

　　"Oh! father, truly? will you really give them to me?"

　　"I'll give you as many more next year," he said, throwing them intoher apron. "So before long you'll get all his gewgaws," he added,rubbing his hands, delighted to be able to speculate on his daughter'sfeelings.

　　Nevertheless, the old man, though still robust, felt the importance ofinitiating his daughter into the secrets of his thrift and itsmanagement. For two consecutive years he made her order the householdmeals in his presence and receive the rents, and he taught her slowlyand successively the names and remunerative capacity of his vineyardsand his farms. About the third year he had so thoroughly accustomedher to his avaricious methods that they had turned into the settledhabits of her own life, and he was able to leave the household keys inher charge without anxiety, and to install her as mistress of thehouse.

　　*****

　　Five years passed away without a single event to relieve themonotonous existence of Eugenie and her father. The same actions wereperformed daily with the automatic regularity of clockwork. The deepsadness of Mademoiselle Grandet was known to every one; but if otherssurmised the cause, she herself never uttered a word that justifiedthe suspicions which all Saumur entertained about the state of therich heiress's heart. Her only society was made up of the threeCruchots and a few of their particular friends whom they had, littleby little, introduced into the Grandet household. They had taught herto play whist, and they came every night for their game. During theyear 1827 her father, feeling the weight of his infirmities, wasobliged to initiate her still further into the secrets of his landedproperty, and told her that in case of difficulty she was to haverecourse to Maitre Cruchot, whose integrity was well known to him.Towards the end of this year the old man, then eighty-two, was seizedby paralysis, which made rapid progress. Dr. Bergerin gave him up.Eugenie, feeling that she was about to be left alone in the world,came, as it were, nearer to her father, and clasped more tightly thislast living link of affection. To her mind, as in that of all lovingwomen, love was the whole of life. Charles was not there, and shedevoted all her care and attention to the old father, whose facultieshad begun to weaken, though his avarice remained instinctively acute.The death of this man offered no contrast to his life. In the morninghe made them roll him to a spot between the chimney of his chamber andthe door of the secret room, which was filled, no doubt, with gold. Heasked for an explanation of every noise he heard, even the slightest;to the great astonishment of the notary, he even heard the watch-dogyawning in the court-yard. He woke up from his apparent stupor at theday and hour when the rents were due, or when accounts had to besettled with his vine-dressers, and receipts given. At such times heworked his chair forward on its castors until he faced the door of theinner room. He made his daughter open it, and watched while she placedthe bags of money one upon another in his secret receptacles andrelocked the door. Then she returned silently to her seat, aftergiving him the key, which he replaced in his waistcoat pocket andfingered from time to time. His old friend the notary, feeling surethat the rich heiress would inevitably marry his nephew the president,if Charles Grandet did not return, redoubled all his attentions; hecame every day to take Grandet's orders, went on his errands toFroidfond, to the farms and the fields and the vineyards, sold thevintages, and turned everything into gold and silver, which foundtheir way in sacks to the secret hiding-place.

　　At length the last struggle came, in which the strong frame of the oldman slowly yielded to destruction. He was determined to sit at thechimney-corner facing the door of the secret room. He drew off androlled up all the coverings which were laid over him, saying to Nanon,"Put them away, lock them up, for fear they should be stolen."So long as he could open his eyes, in which his whole being had nowtaken refuge, he turned them to the door behind which lay histreasures, saying to his daughter, "Are they there? are they there?"in a tone of voice which revealed a sort of panic fear.

　　"Yes, my father," she would answer.

　　"Take care of the gold--put gold before me."

　　Eugenie would then spread coins on a table before him, and he wouldsit for hours together with his eyes fixed upon them, like a childwho, at the moment it first begins to see, gazes in stupidcontemplation at the same object, and like the child, a distressfulsmile would flicker upon his face.

　　"It warms me!" he would sometimes say, as an expression of beatitudestole across his features.

　　When the cure of the parish came to administer the last sacraments,the old man's eyes, sightless, apparently, for some hours, kindled atthe sight of the cross, the candlesticks, and the holy-water vessel ofsilver; he gazed at them fixedly, and his wen moved for the last time.When the priest put the crucifix of silver-gilt to his lips, that hemight kiss the Christ, he made a frightful gesture, as if to seize it;and that last effort cost him his life. He called Eugenie, whom he didnot see, though she was kneeling beside him bathing with tears hisstiffening hand, which was already cold.

　　"My father, bless me!" she entreated.

　　"Take care of it all. You will render me an account yonder!" he said,proving by these last words that Christianity must always be thereligion of misers.

　　*****

　　Eugenie Grandet was now alone in the world in that gray house, withnone but Nanon to whom she could turn with the certainty of beingheard and understood,--Nanon the sole being who loved her for herselfand with whom she could speak of her sorrows. La Grande Nanon was aprovidence for Eugenie. She was not a servant, but a humble friend.After her father's death Eugenie learned from Maitre Cruchot that shepossessed an income of three hundred thousand francs from landed andpersonal property in the arrondissement of Saumur; also six millionsinvested at three per cent in the Funds (bought at sixty, and nowworth seventy-six francs); also two millions in gold coin, and ahundred thousand francs in silver crown-pieces, besides all theinterest which was still to be collected. The sum total of herproperty reached seventeen millions.

　　"Where is my cousin?" was her one thought.

　　The day on which Maitre Cruchot handed in to his client a clear andexact schedule of the whole inheritance, Eugenie remained alone withNanon, sitting beside the fireplace in the vacant hall, where all wasnow a memory, from the chair on castors which her mother had sat in,to the glass from which her cousin drank.

　　"Nanon, we are alone--"

　　"Yes, mademoiselle; and if I knew where he was, the darling, I'd go onfoot to find him."

　　"The ocean is between us," she said.

　　While the poor heiress wept in company of an old servant, in that colddark house, which was to her the universe, the whole province rang,from Nantes to Orleans, with the seventeen millions of MademoiselleGrandet. Among her first acts she had settled an annuity of twelvehundred francs on Nanon, who, already possessed of six hundred more,became a rich and enviable match. In less than a month that good soulpassed from single to wedded life under the protection of AntoineCornoiller, who was appointed keeper of all Mademoiselle Grandet'sestates. Madame Cornoiller possessed one striking advantage over hercontemporaries. Although she was fifty-nine years of age, she did notlook more than forty. Her strong features had resisted the ravages oftime. Thanks to the healthy customs of her semi-conventual life, shelaughed at old age from the vantage-ground of a rosy skin and an ironconstitution. Perhaps she never looked as well in her life as she didon her marriage-day. She had all the benefits of her ugliness, and wasbig and fat and strong, with a look of happiness on her indestructiblefeatures which made a good many people envy Cornoiller.

　　"Fast colors!" said the draper.

　　"Quite likely to have children," said the salt merchant. "She'spickled in brine, saving your presence."

　　"She is rich, and that fellow Cornoiller has done a good thing forhimself," said a third man.

　　When she came forth from the old house on her way to the parishchurch, Nanon, who was loved by all the neighborhood, received manycompliments as she walked down the tortuous street. Eugenie had givenher three dozen silver forks and spoons as a wedding present.Cornoiller, amazed at such magnificence, spoke of his mistress withtears in his eyes; he would willingly have been hacked in pieces inher behalf. Madame Cornoiller, appointed housekeeper to MademoiselleGrandet, got as much happiness out of her new position as she did fromthe possession of a husband. She took charge of the weekly accounts;she locked up the provisions and gave them out daily, after the mannerof her defunct master; she ruled over two servants,--a cook, and amaid whose business it was to mend the house-linen and makemademoiselle's dresses. Cornoiller combined the functions of keeperand bailiff. It is unnecessary to say that the women-servants selectedby Nanon were "perfect treasures." Mademoiselle Grandet thus had fourservants, whose devotion was unbounded. The farmers perceived nochange after Monsieur Grandet's death; the usages and customs he hadsternly established were scrupulously carried out by Monsieur andMadame Cornoiller.

　　At thirty years of age Eugenie knew none of the joys of life. Herpale, sad childhood had glided on beside a mother whose heart, alwaysmisunderstood and wounded, had known only suffering. Leaving this lifejoyfully, the mother pitied the daughter because she still must live;and she left in her child's soul some fugitive remorse and manylasting regrets. Eugenie's first and only love was a wellspring ofsadness within her. Meeting her lover for a few brief days, she hadgiven him her heart between two kisses furtively exchanged; then hehad left her, and a whole world lay between them. This love, cursed byher father, had cost the life of her mother and brought her onlysorrow, mingled with a few frail hopes. Thus her upward spring towardshappiness had wasted her strength and given her nothing in exchangefor it. In the life of the soul, as in the physical life, there is aninspiration and a respiration; the soul needs to absorb the sentimentsof another soul and assimilate them, that it may render them backenriched. Were it not for this glorious human phenomenon, there wouldbe no life for the heart; air would be wanting; it would suffer, andthen perish. Eugenie had begun to suffer. For her, wealth was neithera power nor a consolation; she could not live except through love,through religion, through faith in the future. Love explained to herthe mysteries of eternity. Her heart and the Gospel taught her to knowtwo worlds; she bathed, night and day, in the depths of two infinitethoughts, which for her may have had but one meaning. She drew backwithin herself, loving, and believing herself beloved. For seven yearsher passion had invaded everything. Her treasuries were not themillions whose revenues were rolling up; they were Charles's dressing-case, the portraits hanging above her bed, the jewels recovered fromher father and proudly spread upon a bed of wool in a drawer of theoaken cabinet, the thimble of her aunt, used for a while by hermother, which she wore religiously as she worked at a piece ofembroidery,--a Penelope's web, begun for the sole purpose of puttingupon her finger that gold so rich in memories.

　　It seemed unlikely that Mademoiselle Grandet would marry during theperiod of her mourning. Her genuine piety was well known. Consequentlythe Cruchots, whose policy was sagely guided by the old abbe,contented themselves for the time being with surrounding the greatheiress and paying her the most affectionate attentions. Every eveningthe hall was filled with a party of devoted Cruchotines, who sang thepraises of its mistress in every key. She had her doctor in ordinary,her grand almoner, her chamberlain, her first lady of honor, her primeminister; above all, her chancellor, a chancellor who would fain havesaid much to her. If the heiress had wished for a train-bearer, onewould instantly have been found. She was a queen, obsequiouslyflattered. Flattery never emanates from noble souls; it is the gift oflittle minds, who thus still further belittle themselves to worm theirway into the vital being of the persons around whom they crawl.Flattery means self-interest. So the people who, night after night,assembled in Mademoiselle Grandet's house (they called herMademoiselle de Froidfond) outdid each other in expressions ofadmiration. This concert of praise, never before bestowed uponEugenie, made her blush under its novelty; but insensibly her earbecame habituated to the sound, and however coarse the complimentsmight be, she soon was so accustomed to hear her beauty lauded that ifany new-comer had seemed to think her plain, she would have felt thereproach far more than she might have done eight years earlier. Sheended at last by loving the incense, which she secretly laid at thefeet of her idol. By degrees she grew accustomed to be treated as asovereign and to see her court pressing around her every evening.Monsieur de Bonfons was the hero of the little circle, where his wit,his person, his education, his amiability, were perpetually praised.One or another would remark that in seven years he had largelyincreased his fortune, that Bonfons brought in at least ten thousandfrancs a year, and was surrounded, like the other possessions of theCruchots, by the vast domains of the heiress.

　　"Do you know, mademoiselle," said an habitual visitor, "that theCruchots have an income of forty thousand francs among them!""And then, their savings!" exclaimed an elderly female Cruchotine,Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.

　　"A gentleman from Paris has lately offered Monsieur Cruchot twohundred thousand francs for his practice," said another. "He will sellit if he is appointed /juge de paix/."

　　"He wants to succeed Monsieur de Bonfons as president of the Civilcourts, and is taking measures," replied Madame d'Orsonval. "Monsieurle president will certainly be made councillor."

　　"Yes, he is a very distinguished man," said another,--"don't you thinkso, mademoiselle?"

　　Monsieur de Bonfons endeavored to put himself in keeping with the rolehe sought to play. In spite of his forty years, in spite of his duskyand crabbed features, withered like most judicial faces, he dressed inyouthful fashions, toyed with a bamboo cane, never took snuff inMademoiselle de Froidfond's house, and came in a white cravat and ashirt whose pleated frill gave him a family resemblance to the race ofturkeys. He addressed the beautiful heiress familiarly, and spoke ofher as "Our dear Eugenie." In short, except for the number ofvisitors, the change from loto to whist, and the disappearance ofMonsieur and Madame Grandet, the scene was about the same as the onewith which this history opened. The pack were still pursuing Eugenieand her millions; but the hounds, more in number, lay better on thescent, and beset the prey more unitedly. If Charles could have droppedfrom the Indian Isles, he would have found the same people and thesame interests. Madame des Grassins, to whom Eugenie was full ofkindness and courtesy, still persisted in tormenting the Cruchots.Eugenie, as in former days, was the central figure of the picture; andCharles, as heretofore, would still have been the sovereign of all.Yet there had been some progress. The flowers which the presidentformerly presented to Eugenie on her birthdays and fete-days had nowbecome a daily institution. Every evening he brought the rich heiressa huge and magnificent bouquet, which Madame Cornoiller placedconspicuously in a vase, and secretly threw into a corner of thecourt-yard when the visitors had departed.

　　Early in the spring, Madame des Grassins attempted to trouble thepeace of the Cruchotines by talking to Eugenie of the Marquis deFroidfond, whose ancient and ruined family might be restored if theheiress would give him back his estates through marriage. Madame desGrassins rang the changes on the peerage and the title of marquise,until, mistaking Eugenie's disdainful smile for acquiescence, she wentabout proclaiming that the marriage with "Monsieur Cruchot" was notnearly as certain as people thought.

　　"Though Monsieur de Froidfond is fifty," she said, "he does not lookolder than Monsieur Cruchot. He is a widower, and he has children,that's true. But then he is a marquis; he will be peer of France; andin times like these where you will find a better match? I know it fora fact that Pere Grandet, when he put all his money into Froidfond,intended to graft himself upon that stock; he often told me so. He wasa deep one, that old man!"

　　"Ah! Nanon," said Eugenie, one night as she was going to bed, "how isit that in seven years he has never once written to me?"

　　XIII

　　While these events were happening in Saumur, Charles was making hisfortune in the Indies. His commercial outfit had sold well. He beganby realizing a sum of six thousand dollars. Crossing the line hadbrushed a good many cobwebs out of his brain; he perceived that thebest means of attaining fortune in tropical regions, as well as inEurope, was to buy and sell men. He went to the coast of Africa andbought Negroes, combining his traffic in human flesh with that ofother merchandise equally advantageous to his interests. He carriedinto this business an activity which left him not a moment of leisure.He was governed by the desire of reappearing in Paris with all theprestige of a large fortune, and by the hope of regaining a positioneven more brilliant than the one from which he had fallen.By dint of jostling with men, travelling through many lands, andstudying a variety of conflicting customs, his ideas had been modifiedand had become sceptical. He ceased to have fixed principles of rightand wrong, for he saw what was called a crime in one country lauded asa virtue in another. In the perpetual struggle of selfish interestshis heart grew cold, then contracted, and then dried up. The blood ofthe Grandets did not fail of its destiny; Charles became hard, andeager for prey. He sold Chinamen, Negroes, birds' nests, children,artists; he practised usury on a large scale; the habit of defraudingcustom-houses soon made him less scrupulous about the rights of hisfellow men. He went to the Island of St. Thomas and bought, for a meresong, merchandise that had been captured by pirates, and took it toports where he could sell it at a good price. If the pure and nobleface of Eugenie went with him on his first voyage, like that image ofthe Virgin which Spanish mariners fastened to their masts, if heattributed his first success to the magic influence of the prayers andintercessions of his gentle love, later on women of other kinds,--blacks, mulattoes, whites, and Indian dancing-girls,--orgies andadventures in many lands, completely effaced all recollection of hiscousin, of Saumur, of the house, the bench, the kiss snatched in thedark passage. He remembered only the little garden shut in withcrumbling walls, for it was there he learned the fate that hadovertaken him; but he rejected all connection with his family. Hisuncle was an old dog who had filched his jewels; Eugenie had no placein his heart nor in his thoughts, though she did have a place in hisaccounts as a creditor for the sum of six thousand francs.Such conduct and such ideas explain Charles Grandet's silence. In theIndies, at St. Thomas, on the coast of Africa, at Lisbon, and in theUnited States the adventurer had taken the pseudonym of Shepherd, thathe might not compromise his own name. Charles Shepherd could safely beindefatigable, bold, grasping, and greedy of gain, like a man whoresolves to snatch his fortune /quibus cumque viis/, and makes hasteto have done with villany, that he may spend the rest of his life asan honest man.

　　With such methods, prosperity was rapid and brilliant; and in 1827Charles Grandet returned to Bordeaux on the "Marie Caroline," a finebrig belonging to a royalist house of business. He brought with himnineteen hundred thousand francs worth of gold-dust, from which heexpected to derive seven or eight per cent more at the Paris mint. Onthe brig he met a gentleman-in-ordinary to His Majesty Charles X.,Monsieur d'Aubrion, a worthy old man who had committed the folly ofmarrying a woman of fashion with a fortune derived from the West IndiaIslands. To meet the costs of Madame d'Aubrion's extravagance, he hadgone out to the Indies to sell the property, and was now returningwith his family to France.

　　Monsieur and Madame d'Aubrion, of the house of d'Aubrion de Buch, afamily of southern France, whose last /captal/, or chief, died before1789, were now reduced to an income of about twenty thousand francs,and they possessed an ugly daughter whom the mother was resolved tomarry without a /dot/,--the family fortune being scarcely sufficientfor the demands of her own life in Paris. This was an enterprise whosesuccess might have seemed problematical to most men of the world, inspite of the cleverness with which such men credit a fashionablewoman; in fact, Madame d'Aubrion herself, when she looked at herdaughter, almost despaired of getting rid of her to any one, even to aman craving connection with nobility. Mademoiselle d'Aubrion was along, spare, spindling demoiselle, like her namesake the insect; hermouth was disdainful; over it hung a nose that was too long, thick atthe end, sallow in its normal condition, but very red after a meal,--asort of vegetable phenomenon which is particularly disagreeable whenit appears in the middle of a pale, dull, and uninteresting face. Inone sense she was all that a worldly mother, thirty-eight years of ageand still a beauty with claims to admiration, could have wished.However, to counterbalance her personal defects, the marquise gave herdaughter a distinguished air, subjected her to hygienic treatmentwhich provisionally kept her nose at a reasonable flesh-tint, taughther the art of dressing well, endowed her with charming manners,showed her the trick of melancholy glances which interest a man andmake him believe that he has found a long-sought angel, taught her themanoeuvre of the foot,--letting it peep beneath the petticoat, to showits tiny size, at the moment when the nose became aggressively red; inshort, Madame d'Aubrion had cleverly made the very best of heroffspring. By means of full sleeves, deceptive pads, puffed dressesamply trimmed, and high-pressure corsets, she had obtained suchcurious feminine developments that she ought, for the instruction ofmothers, to have exhibited them in a museum.

　　Charles became very intimate with Madame d'Aubrion precisely becauseshe was desirous of becoming intimate with him. Persons who were onboard the brig declared that the handsome Madame d'Aubrion neglectedno means of capturing so rich a son-in-law. On landing at Bordeaux inJune, 1827, Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle d'Aubrion, and Charleslodged at the same hotel and started together for Paris. The hoteld'Aubrion was hampered with mortgages; Charles was destined to freeit. The mother told him how delighted she would be to give up theground-floor to a son-in-law. Not sharing Monsieur d'Aubrion'sprejudices on the score of nobility, she promised Charles Grandet toobtain a royal ordinance from Charles X. which would authorize him,Grandet, to take the name and arms of d'Aubrion and to succeed, bypurchasing the entailed estate for thirty-six thousand francs a year,to the titles of Captal de Buch and Marquis d'Aubrion. By thus unitingtheir fortunes, living on good terms, and profiting by sinecures, thetwo families might occupy the hotel d'Aubrion with an income of over ahundred thousand francs.

　　"And when a man has a hundred thousand francs a year, a name, afamily, and a position at court,--for I will get you appointed asgentleman-of-the-bedchamber,--he can do what he likes," she said toCharles. "You can then become anything you choose,--master of therolls in the council of State, prefect, secretary to an embassy, theambassador himself, if you like. Charles X. is fond of d'Aubrion; theyhave known each other from childhood."

　　Intoxicated with ambition, Charles toyed with the hopes thus cleverlypresented to him in the guise of confidences poured from heart toheart. Believing his father's affairs to have been settled by hisuncle, he imagined himself suddenly anchored in the Faubourg Saint-Germain,--that social object of all desire, where, under shelter ofMademoiselle Mathilde's purple nose, he was to reappear as the Comted'Aubrion, very much as the Dreux reappeared in Breze. Dazzled by theprosperity of the Restoration, which was tottering when he leftFrance, fascinated by the splendor of aristocratic ideas, hisintoxication, which began on the brig, increased after he reachedParis, and he finally determined to take the course and reach the highposition which the selfish hopes of his would-be mother-in-law pointedout to him. His cousin counted for no more than a speck in thisbrilliant perspective; but he went to see Annette. True woman of theworld, Annette advised her old friend to make the marriage, andpromised him her support in all his ambitious projects. In her heartshe was enchanted to fasten an ugly and uninteresting girl on Charles,whose life in the West Indies had rendered him very attractive. Hiscomplexion had bronzed, his manners had grown decided and bold, likethose of a man accustomed to make sharp decisions, to rule, and tosucceed. Charles breathed more at his ease in Paris, conscious that henow had a part to play.

　　Des Grassins, hearing of his return, of his approaching marriage andhis large fortune, came to see him, and inquired about the threehundred thousand francs still required to settle his father's debts.He found Grandet in conference with a goldsmith, from whom he hadordered jewels for Mademoiselle d'Aubrion's /corbeille/, and who wasthen submitting the designs. Charles had brought back magnificentdiamonds, and the value of their setting, together with the plate andjewelry of the new establishment, amounted to more than two hundredthousand francs. He received des Grassins, whom he did not recognize,with the impertinence of a young man of fashion conscious of havingkilled four men in as many duels in the Indies. Monsieur des Grassinshad already called several times. Charles listened to him coldly, andthen replied, without fully understanding what had been said to him,--"My father's affairs are not mine. I am much obliged, monsieur, forthe trouble you have been good enough to take,--by which, however, Ireally cannot profit. I have not earned two millions by the sweat ofmy brow to fling them at the head of my father's creditors.""But suppose that your father's estate were within a few days to bedeclared bankrupt?"

　　"Monsieur, in a few days I shall be called the Comte d'Aubrion; youwill understand, therefore, that what you threaten is of noconsequence to me. Besides, you know as well as I do that when a manhas an income of a hundred thousand francs his father has /neverfailed/." So saying, he politely edged Monsieur des Grassins to thedoor.

　　*****

　　At the beginning of August in the same year, Eugenie was sitting onthe little wooden bench where her cousin had sworn to love hereternally, and where she usually breakfasted if the weather were fine.The poor girl was happy, for the moment, in the fresh and joyoussummer air, letting her memory recall the great and the little eventsof her love and the catastrophes which had followed it. The sun hadjust reached the angle of the ruined wall, so full of chinks, which noone, through a caprice of the mistress, was allowed to touch, thoughCornoiller often remarked to his wife that "it would fall and crushsomebody one of these days." At this moment the postman knocked, andgave a letter to Madame Cornoiller, who ran into the garden, cryingout:

　　"Mademoiselle, a letter!" She gave it to her mistress, adding, "Is itthe one you expected?"

　　The words rang as loudly in the heart of Eugenie as they echoed insound from wall to wall of the court and garden.

　　"Paris--from him--he has returned!"

　　Eugenie turned pale and held the letter for a moment. She trembled soviolently that she could not break the seal. La Grande Nanon stoodbefore her, both hands on her hips, her joy puffing as it were likesmoke through the cracks of her brown face.

　　"Read it, mademoiselle!"

　　"Ah, Nanon, why did he return to Paris? He went from Saumur.""Read it, and you'll find out."

　　Eugenie opened the letter with trembling fingers. A cheque on thehouse of "Madame des Grassins and Coret, of Saumur," fluttered down.Nanon picked it up.

　　My dear Cousin,--

　　"No longer 'Eugenie,'" she thought, and her heart quailed.

　　You--

　　"He once said 'thou.'" She folded her arms and dared not read anotherword; great tears gathered in her eyes.

　　"Is he dead?" asked Nanon.

　　"If he were, he could not write," said Eugenie.

　　She then read the whole letter, which was as follows:

　　My dear Cousin,--You will, I am sure, hear with pleasure of the

　　success of my enterprise. You brought me luck; I have come back

　　rich, and I have followed the advice of my uncle, whose death,

　　together with that of my aunt, I have just learned from Monsieur

　　des Grassins. The death of parents is in the course of nature, and

　　we must succeed them. I trust you are by this time consoled.

　　Nothing can resist time, as I am well aware. Yes, my dear cousin,

　　the day of illusions is, unfortunately, gone for me. How could it

　　be otherwise? Travelling through many lands, I have reflected upon

　　life. I was a child when I went away,--I have come back a man.

　　To-day, I think of many I did not dream of then. You are free, my

　　dear cousin, and I am free still. Nothing apparently hinders the

　　realization of our early hopes; but my nature is too loyal to hide

　　from you the situation in which I find myself. I have not

　　forgotten our relations; I have always remembered, throughout my

　　long wanderings, the little wooden seat--

　　Eugenie rose as if she were sitting on live coals, and went away andsat down on the stone steps of the court.

　　--the little wooden seat where we vowed to love each other

　　forever, the passage, the gray hall, my attic chamber, and the

　　night when, by your delicate kindness, you made my future easier

　　to me. Yes, these recollections sustained my courage; I said in my

　　heart that you were thinking of me at the hour we had agreed upon.

　　Have you always looked at the clouds at nine o'clock? Yes, I am

　　sure of it. I cannot betray so true a friendship,--no, I must not

　　deceive you. An alliance has been proposed to me which satisfies

　　all my ideas of matrimony. Love in marriage is a delusion. My

　　present experience warns me that in marrying we are bound to obey

　　all social laws and meet the conventional demands of the world.

　　Now, between you and me there are differences which might affect

　　your future, my dear cousin, even more than they would mine. I

　　will not here speak of your customs and inclinations, your

　　education, nor yet of your habits, none of which are in keeping

　　with Parisian life, or with the future which I have marked out for

　　myself. My intention is to keep my household on a stately footing,

　　to receive much company,--in short, to live in the world; and I

　　think I remember that you love a quiet and tranquil life. I will

　　be frank, and make you the judge of my situation; you have the

　　right to understand it and to judge it.

　　I possess at the present moment an income of eighty thousand

　　francs. This fortune enables me to marry into the family of

　　Aubrion, whose heiress, a young girl nineteen years of age, brings

　　me a title, a place of gentleman-of-the-bed-chamber to His

　　Majesty, and a very brilliant position. I will admit to you, my

　　dear cousin, that I do not love Mademoiselle d'Aubrion; but in

　　marrying her I secure to my children a social rank whose

　　advantages will one day be incalculable: monarchical principles

　　are daily coming more and more into favor. Thus in course of time

　　my son, when he becomes Marquis d'Aubrion, having, as he then will

　　have, an entailed estate with a rental of forty thousand francs a

　　year, can obtain any position in the State which he may think

　　proper to select. We owe ourselves to our children.

　　You see, my cousin, with what good faith I lay the state of my

　　heart, my hopes, and my fortune before you. Possibly, after seven

　　years' separation, you have yourself forgotten our youthful loves;

　　but I have never forgotten either your kindness or my own words. I

　　remember all, even words that were lightly uttered,--words by

　　which a man less conscientious than I, with a heart less youthful

　　and less upright, would scarcely feel himself bound. In telling

　　you that the marriage I propose to make is solely one of

　　convenience, that I still remember our childish love, am I not

　　putting myself entirely in your hands and making you the mistress

　　of my fate? am I not telling you that if I must renounce my social

　　ambitions, I shall willingly content myself with the pure and

　　simple happiness of which you have shown me so sweet an image?"Tan, ta, ta--tan, ta, ti," sang Charles Grandet to the air of /Nonpiu andrai/, as he signed himself,--

　　Your devoted cousin,

　　Charles.

　　"Thunder! that's doing it handsomely!" he said, as he looked about himfor the cheque; having found it, he added the words:--

　　P.S.--I enclose a cheque on the des Grassins bank for eight

　　thousand francs to your order, payable in gold, which includes the

　　capital and interest of the sum you were kind enough to lend me. I

　　am expecting a case from Bordeaux which contains a few things

　　which you must allow me to offer you as a mark of my unceasing

　　gratitude. You can send my dressing-case by the diligence to the

　　hotel d'Aubrion, rue Hillerin-Bertin.

　　"By the diligence!" said Eugenie. "A thing for which I would have laiddown my life!"

　　Terrible and utter disaster! The ship went down, leaving not a spar,not a plank, on a vast ocean of hope! Some women when they seethemselves abandoned will try to tear their lover from the arms of arival, they will kill her, and rush to the ends of the earth,--to thescaffold, to their tomb. That, no doubt, is fine; the motive of thecrime is a great passion, which awes even human justice. Other womenbow their heads and suffer in silence; they go their way dying,resigned, weeping, forgiving, praying, and recollecting, till theydraw their last breath. This is love,--true love, the love of angels,the proud love which lives upon its anguish and dies of it. Such wasEugenie's love after she had read that dreadful letter. She raised hereyes to heaven, thinking of the last words uttered by her dyingmother, who, with the prescience of death, had looked into the futurewith clear and penetrating eyes: Eugenie, remembering that propheticdeath, that prophetic life, measured with one glance her own destiny.Nothing was left for her; she could only unfold her wings, stretchupward to the skies, and live in prayer until the day of herdeliverance.

　　"My mother was right," she said, weeping. "Suffer--and die!"XIV

　　Eugenie came slowly back from the garden to the house, and avoidedpassing, as was her custom, through the corridor. But the memory ofher cousin was in the gray old hall and on the chimney-piece, wherestood a certain saucer and the old Sevres sugar-bowl which she usedevery morning at her breakfast.

　　This day was destined to be solemn throughout and full of events.Nanon announced the cure of the parish church. He was related to theCruchots, and therefore in the interests of Monsieur de Bonfons. Forsome time past the old abbe had urged him to speak to MademoiselleGrandet, from a purely religious point of view, about the duty ofmarriage for a woman in her position. When she saw her pastor, Eugeniesupposed he had come for the thousand francs which she gave monthly tothe poor, and she told Nanon to go and fetch them; but the cure onlysmiled.

　　"To-day, mademoiselle," he said, "I have come to speak to you about apoor girl in whom the whole town of Saumur takes an interest, who,through lack of charity to herself, neglects her Christian duties.""Monsieur le cure, you have come to me at a moment when I cannot thinkof my neighbor, I am filled with thoughts of myself. I am veryunhappy; my only refuge is in the Church; her bosom is large enough tohold all human woe, her love so full that we may draw from its depthsand never drain it dry."

　　"Mademoiselle, in speaking of this young girl we shall speak of you.Listen! If you wish to insure your salvation you have only two pathsto take,--either leave the world or obey its laws. Obey either yourearthly destiny or your heavenly destiny."

　　"Ah! your voice speaks to me when I need to hear a voice. Yes, God hassent you to me; I will bid farewell to the world and live for Godalone, in silence and seclusion."

　　"My daughter, you must think long before you take so violent a step.Marriage is life, the veil is death."

　　"Yes, death,--a quick death!" she said, with dreadful eagerness."Death? but you have great obligations to fulfil to society,mademoiselle. Are you not the mother of the poor, to whom you giveclothes and wood in winter and work in summer? Your great fortune is aloan which you must return, and you have sacredly accepted it as such.To bury yourself in a convent would be selfishness; to remain an oldmaid is to fail in duty. In the first place, can you manage your vastproperty alone? May you not lose it? You will have law-suits, you willfind yourself surrounded by inextricable difficulties. Believe yourpastor: a husband is useful; you are bound to preserve what God hasbestowed upon you. I speak to you as a precious lamb of my flock. Youlove God too truly not to find your salvation in the midst of hisworld, of which you are noble ornament and to which you owe yourexample."

　　At this moment Madame des Grassins was announced. She came incited byvengeance and the sense of a great despair.

　　"Mademoiselle," she said--"Ah! here is monsieur le cure; I am silent.I came to speak to you on business; but I see that you are conferringwith--"

　　"Madame," said the cure, "I leave the field to you."

　　"Oh! monsieur le cure," said Eugenie, "come back later; your supportis very necessary to me just now."

　　"Ah, yes, indeed, my poor child!" said Madame des Grassins."What do you mean?" asked Eugenie and the cure together.

　　"Don't I know about your cousin's return, and his marriage withMademoiselle d'Aubrion? A woman doesn't carry her wits in her pocket."Eugenie blushed, and remained silent for a moment. From this day forthshe assumed the impassible countenance for which her father had beenso remarkable.

　　"Well, madame," she presently said, ironically, "no doubt I carry mywits in my pocket, for I do not understand you. Speak, say what youmean, before monsieur le cure; you know he is my director.""Well, then, mademoiselle, here is what des Grassins writes me. Readit."

　　Eugenie read the following letter:--

　　My dear Wife,--Charles Grandet has returned from the Indies and

　　has been in Paris about a month--

　　"A month!" thought Eugenie, her hand falling to her side. After apause she resumed the letter,--

　　I had to dance attendance before I was allowed to see the future

　　Vicomte d'Aubrion. Though all Paris is talking of his marriage and

　　the banns are published--

　　"He wrote to me after that!" thought Eugenie. She did not conclude thethought; she did not cry out, as a Parisian woman would have done,"The villain!" but though she said it not, contempt was none the lesspresent in her mind.

　　The marriage, however, will not come off. The Marquis d'Aubrion

　　will never give his daughter to the son of a bankrupt. I went to

　　tell Grandet of the steps his uncle and I took in his father's

　　business, and the clever manoeuvres by which we had managed to

　　keep the creditor's quiet until the present time. The insolent

　　fellow had the face to say to me--to me, who for five years have

　　devoted myself night and day to his interests and his honor!--that

　　/his father's affairs were not his/! A solicitor would have had

　　the right to demand fees amounting to thirty or forty thousand

　　francs, one per cent on the total of the debts. But patience!

　　there are twelve hundred thousand francs legitimately owing to the

　　creditors, and I shall at once declare his father a bankrupt.

　　I went into this business on the word of that old crocodile

　　Grandet, and I have made promises in the name of his family. If

　　Monsieur de vicomte d'Aubrion does not care for his honor, I care

　　for mine. I shall explain my position to the creditors. Still, I

　　have too much respect for Mademoiselle Eugenie (to whom under

　　happier circumstances we once hoped to be allied) to act in this

　　matter before you have spoken to her about it--

　　There Eugenie paused, and coldly returned the letter without finishingit.

　　"I thank you," she said to Madame des Grassins.

　　"Ah! you have the voice and manner of your deceased father," Madamedes Grassins replied.

　　"Madame, you have eight thousand francs to pay us," said Nanon,producing Charles's cheque.

　　"That's true; have the kindness to come with me now, MadameCornoiller."

　　"Monsieur le cure," said Eugenie with a noble composure, inspired bythe thought she was about to express, "would it be a sin to remain avirgin after marriage?"

　　"That is a case of conscience whose solution is not within myknowledge. If you wish to know what the celebrated Sanchez says of itin his treatise 'De Matrimonio,' I shall be able to tell youto-morrow."

　　The cure went away; Mademoiselle Grandet went up to her father'ssecret room and spent the day there alone, without coming down todinner, in spite of Nanon's entreaties. She appeared in the evening atthe hour when the usual company began to arrive. Never was the oldhall so full as on this occasion. The news of Charles's return and hisfoolish treachery had spread through the whole town. But howeverwatchful the curiosity of the visitors might be, it was leftunsatisfied. Eugenie, who expected scrutiny, allowed none of the cruelemotions that wrung her soul to appear on the calm surface of herface. She was able to show a smiling front in answer to all who triedto testify their interest by mournful looks or melancholy speeches.She hid her misery behind a veil of courtesy. Towards nine o'clock thegames ended and the players left the tables, paying their losses anddiscussing points of the game as they joined the rest of the company.At the moment when the whole party rose to take leave, an unexpectedand striking event occurred, which resounded through the length andbreadth of Saumur, from thence through the arrondissement, and even tothe four surrounding prefectures.

　　"Stay, monsieur le president," said Eugenie to Monsieur de Bonfons asshe saw him take his cane.

　　There was not a person in that numerous assembly who was unmoved bythese words. The president turned pale, and was forced to sit down."The president gets the millions," said Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt."It is plain enough; the president marries Mademoiselle Grandet,"cried Madame d'Orsonval.

　　"All the trumps in one hand," said the abbe.

　　"A love game," said the notary.

　　Each and all said his say, made his pun, and looked at the heiressmounted on her millions as on a pedestal. The drama begun nine yearsbefore had reached its conclusion. To tell the president, in face ofall Saumur, to "stay," was surely the same thing as proclaiming himher husband. In provincial towns social conventionalities are sorigidly enforced than an infraction like this constituted a solemnpromise.

　　"Monsieur le president," said Eugenie in a voice of some emotion whenthey were left alone, "I know what pleases you in me. Swear to leaveme free during my whole life, to claim none of the rights whichmarriage will give you over me, and my hand is yours. Oh!" she added,seeing him about to kneel at her feet, "I have more to say. I must notdeceive you. In my heart I cherish one inextinguishable feeling.Friendship is the only sentiment which I can give to a husband. I wishneither to affront him nor to violate the laws of my own heart. Butyou can possess my hand and my fortune only at the cost of doing me aninestimable service."

　　"I am ready for all things," said the president.

　　"Here are fifteen hundred thousand francs," she said, drawing from herbosom a certificate of a hundred shares in the Bank of France. "Go toParis,--not to-morrow, but instantly. Find Monsieur des Grassins,learn the names of my uncle's creditors, call them together, pay themin full all that was owing, with interest at five per cent from theday the debt was incurred to the present time. Be careful to obtain afull and legal receipt, in proper form, before a notary. You are amagistrate, and I can trust this matter in your hands. You are a manof honor; I will put faith in your word, and meet the dangers of lifeunder shelter of your name. Let us have mutual indulgence. We haveknown each other so long that we are almost related; you would notwish to render me unhappy."

　　The president fell at the feet of the rich heiress, his heart beatingand wrung with joy.

　　"I will be your slave!" he said.

　　"When you obtain the receipts, monsieur," she resumed, with a coldglance, "you will take them with all the other papers to my cousinGrandet, and you will give him this letter. On your return I will keepmy word."

　　The president understood perfectly that he owed the acquiescence ofMademoiselle Grandet to some bitterness of love, and he made haste toobey her orders, lest time should effect a reconciliation between thepair.

　　When Monsieur de Bonfons left her, Eugenie fell back in her chair andburst into tears. All was over.

　　The president took the mail-post, and reached Paris the next evening.The morning after his arrival he went to see des Grassins, andtogether they summoned the creditors to meet at the notary's officewhere the vouchers had been deposited. Not a single creditor failed tobe present. Creditors though they were, justice must be done to them,--they were all punctual. Monsieur de Bonfons, in the name ofMademoiselle Grandet, paid them the amount of their claims withinterest. The payment of interest was a remarkable event in theParisian commerce of that day. When the receipts were all legallyregistered, and des Grassins had received for his services the sum offifty thousand francs allowed to him by Eugenie, the president madehis way to the hotel d'Aubrion and found Charles just entering his ownapartment after a serious encounter with his prospective father-in-law. The old marquis had told him plainly that he should not marry hisdaughter until all the creditors of Guillaume Grandet had been paid infull.

　　The president gave Charles the following letter:--

　　My Cousin,--Monsieur le president de Bonfons has undertaken to

　　place in your hands the aquittance for all claims upon my uncle,

　　also a receipt by which I acknowledge having received from you the

　　sum total of those claims. I have heard of a possible failure, and

　　I think that the son of a bankrupt may not be able to marry

　　Mademoiselle d'Aubrion. Yes, my cousin, you judged rightly of my

　　mind and of my manners. I have, it is true, no part in the world;

　　I understand neither its calculations nor its customs; and I could

　　not give you the pleasures that you seek in it. Be happy,

　　according to the social conventions to which you have sacrificed

　　our love. To make your happiness complete I can only offer you

　　your father's honor. Adieu! You will always have a faithful friend

　　in your cousin

　　Eugenie.

　　The president smiled at the exclamation which the ambitious young mancould not repress as he received the documents.

　　"We shall announce our marriages at the same time," remarked Monsieurde Bonfons.

　　"Ah! you marry Eugenie? Well, I am delighted; she is a good girl.But," added Charles, struck with a luminous idea, "she must be rich?""She had," said the president, with a mischievous smile, "aboutnineteen millions four days ago; but she has only seventeen millionsto-day."

　　Charles looked at him thunderstruck.

　　"Seventeen mil--"

　　"Seventeen millions; yes, monsieur. We shall muster, MademoiselleGrandet and I, an income of seven hundred and fifty thousand francswhen we marry."

　　"My dear cousin," said Charles, recovering a little of his assurance,"we can push each other's fortunes."

　　"Agreed," said the president. "Here is also a little case which I amcharged to give into your own hands," he added, placing on the tablethe leather box which contained the dressing-case.

　　"Well, my dear friend," said Madame d'Aubrion, entering the roomwithout noticing the president, "don't pay any attention to what poorMonsieur d'Aubrion has just said to you; the Duchesse de Chaulieu hasturned his head. I repeat, nothing shall interfere with themarriage--"

　　"Very good, madame. The three millions which my father owed were paidyesterday."

　　"In money?" she asked.

　　"Yes, in full, capital and interest; and I am about to do honor to hismemory--"

　　"What folly!" exclaimed his mother-in-law. "Who is this?" shewhispered in Grandet's ear, perceiving the president.

　　"My man of business," he answered in a low voice.

　　The marquise bowed superciliously to Monsieur de Bonfons."We are pushing each other's fortunes already," said the president,taking up his hat. "Good-by, cousin."

　　"He is laughing at me, the old cockatoo! I'd like to put six inches ofiron into him!" muttered Charles.

　　The president was out of hearing. Three days later Monsieur deBonfons, on his return to Saumur, announced his marriage with Eugenie.Six months after the marriage he was appointed councillor in the Courroyale at Angers. Before leaving Saumur Madame de Bonfons had the goldof certain jewels, once so precious to her, melted up, and put,together with the eight thousand francs paid back by her cousin, intoa golden pyx, which she gave to the parish church where she had solong prayed for /him/. She now spent her time between Angers andSaumur. Her husband, who had shown some public spirit on a certainoccasion, became a judge in the superior courts, and finally, after afew years, president of them. He was anxiously awaiting a generalelection, in the hope of being returned to the Chamber of deputies. Hehankered after a peerage; and then--

　　"The king will be his cousin, won't he?" said Nanon, la Grande Nanon,Madame Cornoiller, bourgeoise of Saumur, as she listened to hermistress, who was recounting the honors to which she was called.Nevertheless, Monsieur de Bonfons (he had finally abolished hispatronymic of Cruchot) did not realize any of his ambitious ideas. Hedied eight days after his election as deputy of Saumur. God, who seesall and never strikes amiss, punished him, no doubt, for his sordidcalculations and the legal cleverness with which, /accurante Cruchot/,he had drawn up his marriage contract, in which husband and wife gaveto each other, "in case they should have no children, their entireproperty of every kind, landed or otherwise, without exception orreservation, dispensing even with the formality of an inventory;provided that said omission of said inventory shall not injure theirheirs and assigns, it being understood that this deed of gift is,etc., etc." This clause of the contract will explain the profoundrespect which monsieur le president always testified for the wishes,and above all, for the solitude of Madame de Bonfons. Women cited himas the most considerate and delicate of men, pitied him, and even wentso far as to find fault with the passion and grief of Eugenie, blamingher, as women know so well how to blame, with cruel but discreetinsinuation.

　　"Madame de Bonfons must be very ill to leave her husband entirelyalone. Poor woman! Is she likely to get well? What is it? Somethinggastric? A cancer?"--"She has grown perfectly yellow. She ought toconsult some celebrated doctor in Paris."--"How can she be happywithout a child? They say she loves her husband; then why not give himan heir?--in his position, too!"--"Do you know, it is really dreadful!If it is the result of mere caprice, it is unpardonable. Poorpresident!"

　　Endowed with the delicate perception which a solitary soul acquiresthrough constant meditation, through the exquisite clear-sightednesswith which a mind aloof from life fastens on all that falls within itssphere, Eugenie, taught by suffering and by her later education todivine thought, knew well that the president desired her death that hemight step into possession of their immense fortune, augmented by theproperty of his uncle the notary and his uncle the abbe, whom it hadlately pleased God to call to himself. The poor solitary pitied thepresident. Providence avenged her for the calculations and theindifference of a husband who respected the hopeless passion on whichshe spent her life because it was his surest safeguard. To give lifeto a child would give death to his hopes,--the hopes of selfishness,the joys of ambition, which the president cherished as he looked intothe future.

　　God thus flung piles of gold upon this prisoner to whom gold was amatter of indifference, who longed for heaven, who lived, pious andgood, in holy thoughts, succoring the unfortunate in secret, and neverwearying of such deeds. Madame de Bonfons became a widow at thirty-six. She is still beautiful, but with the beauty of a woman who isnearly forty years of age. Her face is white and placid and calm; hervoice gentle and self-possessed; her manners are simple. She has thenoblest qualities of sorrow, the saintliness of one who has neversoiled her soul by contact with the world; but she has also the rigidbearing of an old maid and the petty habits inseparable from thenarrow round of provincial life. In spite of her vast wealth, shelives as the poor Eugenie Grandet once lived. The fire is neverlighted on her hearth until the day when her father allowed it to belighted in the hall, and it is put out in conformity with the ruleswhich governed her youthful years. She dresses as her mother dressed.The house in Saumur, without sun, without warmth, always in shadow,melancholy, is an image of her life. She carefully accumulates herincome, and might seem parsimonious did she not disarm criticism by anoble employment of her wealth. Pious and charitable institutions, ahospital for old age, Christian schools for children, a public libraryrichly endowed, bear testimony against the charge of avarice whichsome persons lay at her door. The churches of Saumur owe much of theirembellishment to her. Madame de Bonfons (sometimes ironically spokenof as mademoiselle) inspires for the most part reverential respect:and yet that noble heart, beating only with tenderest emotions, hasbeen, from first to last, subjected to the calculations of humanselfishness; money has cast its frigid influence upon that hallowedlife and taught distrust of feelings to a woman who is all feeling."I have none but you to love me," she says to Nanon.

　　The hand of this woman stanches the secret wounds in many families.She goes on her way to heaven attended by a train of benefactions. Thegrandeur of her soul redeems the narrowness of her education and thepetty habits of her early life.

　　Such is the history of Eugenie Grandet, who is in the world but not ofit; who, created to be supremely a wife and mother, has neitherhusband nor children nor family. Lately there has been some questionof her marrying again. The Saumur people talk of her and of theMarquis de Froidfond, whose family are beginning to beset the richwidow just as, in former days, the Cruchots laid siege to the richheiress. Nanon and Cornoiller are, it is said, in the interests of themarquis. Nothing could be more false. Neither la Grande Nanon norCornoiller has sufficient mind to understand the corruptions of theworld.

　　End　　Father Goriot

　　by Honore de Balzac

　　Translated by Ellen Marriage

　　To the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a token of admiration for his works and genius. DE BALZAC.

　　Mme. Vauquer (nee de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for the past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Nueve- Sainte-Genevieve, in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. Her house (known in the neighborhood as the Maison Vauquer) receives men and women, old and young, and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment; but, at the same time, it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years, and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest. In 1819, however, the time when this drama opens, there was an almost penniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer's boarders.

　　That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature; but it must do service again here, not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over.

　　Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to doubt. The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color, are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre, in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there. Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about, that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit, soon consumed. Civilization, like the car of Juggernaut, is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course; this also is broken, and Civilization continues on her course triumphant. And you, too, will do the like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself, "Perhaps this may amuse me." You will read the story of Father Goriot's secret woes, and, dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of exaggeration, of writing romances. Ah! once for all, this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance! ALL IS TRUE,--so true, that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps in his own heart.

　　The lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer's own property. It is still standing in the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l'Arbalete, that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace, two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden- hued cupolas.

　　In that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud nor water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls. The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls. A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness, old age lying down to die, and joyous youth condemned to drudgery. It is the ugliest quarter of Paris, and, it may be added, the least known. But, before all things, the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images. Even so, step by step the daylight decreases, and the cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs. The comparison holds good! Who shall say which is more ghastly, the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts?

　　The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and looks out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house in section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte- Genevieve. Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved with cobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door, above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath, in rather smaller letters, "Lodgings for both sexes, etc."

　　During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached. On the opposite wall, at the further end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. The half-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777:

　　"Whoe'er thou art, thy master see;   He is, or was, or ought to be."

　　At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little garden is no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house. A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit, and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her lodgers; every year the widow trembles for her vintage.

　　A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; LINE- trees, as Mme. Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers.

　　The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce, pot-herbs, and parsley. Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the dog-days, such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade.

　　The house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics under the roof. It is built of rough stone, and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris. There are five windows in each story in the front of the house; all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry, so that the lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the house there are but two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating.

　　Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the wood-shed is situated on the further side, and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams. The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water, under pain of pestilence.

　　The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses. Access is given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor, a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred windows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into the dining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of tiles, which are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that sitting- room. The furniture is covered with horse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is a round table in the middle, with a purplish-red marble top, on which there stands, by way of ornament, the inevitable white china tea-service, covered with a half-effaced gilt network. The floor is sufficiently uneven, the wainscot rises to elbow height, and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper, on which the principal scenes from Telemaque are depicted, the various classical personages being colored. The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses, displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them. The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste.

　　The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language, and which should be called the odeur de pension. The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a stuffy, musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital. It might be possible to describe it if some one should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger, young or old. Yet, in spite of these stale horrors, the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir, when compared with the adjoining dining- room.

　　The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now a matter of conjecture, for the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic outlines. A collection of dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin sheen on them, and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room. In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in which the lodgers' table napkins, more or less soiled and stained with wine, are kept. Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere, which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables. You expect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on wet days; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite, framed every one in a black varnished frame, with a gilt beading round it; you know the sort of tortoise-shell clock-case, inlaid with brass; the green stove, the Argand lamps, covered with oil and dust, have met your eyes before. The oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish externe will write his name on the surface, using his thumb-nail as a style. The chairs are broken-down invalids; the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good; and finally, the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks, hingeless, charred, broken away about the holes. It would be impossible to give an idea of the old, rotten, shaky, cranky, worm-eaten, halt, maimed, one- eyed, rickety, and ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description, which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon. The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color. In short, there is no illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire, parsimonious, concentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet it has not sunk into the mire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet, its clothing is ready to drop to pieces.

　　This apartment is in all its glory at seven o'clock in the morning, when Mme. Vauquer's cat appears, announcing the near approach of his mistress, and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls, each protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting to the world. A moment later the widow shows her face; she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles into the room in her slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman, with a bloated countenance, and a nose like a parrot's beak set in the middle of it; her fat little hands (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her shapeless, slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune, where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes. Mme. Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being disheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark, suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills; in short, she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodging- house, as surely as her lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress. You can no more imagine the one without the other, than you can think of a jail without a turnkey. The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she leads, just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital. The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown, with the wadding protruding through the rents in the material, is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room, the dining-room, and the little garden; it discovers the cook, it foreshadows the lodgers--the picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress.

　　Mme. Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who "have seen a deal of trouble." She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in flesh and blood, who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher price for her services, but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru, if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed, or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot. Still, "she is a good woman at bottom," said the lodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her, and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves.

　　What had M. Vauquer been? The lady was never very explicit on this head. How had she lost her money? "Through trouble," was her answer. He had treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying nobody, because, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through every possible misfortune.

　　Sylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps, hastened to serve the lodgers' breakfasts. Beside those who lived in the house, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but these externes usually only came to dinner, for which they paid thirty francs a month.

　　At the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven inmates. The best rooms in the house were on the first story, Mme. Vauquer herself occupying the least important, while the rest were let to a Mme. Couture, the widow of a commissary- general in the service of the Republic. With her lived Victorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to whom she filled the place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year.

　　The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that he was a retired merchant, and was addressed as M. Vautrin. Two of the four rooms on the third floor were also let-- one to an elderly spinster, a Mlle. Michonneau, and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli, Italian paste and starch, who allowed the others to address him as "Father Goriot." The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage, to impecunious students, who like "Father Goriot" and Mlle. Michonneau, could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and lodging. Mme. Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort; they ate too much bread, and she only took them in default of better.

　　At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young man from the neighborhood of Angouleme, one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him. Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac, for that was his name, to work. He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents' hopes are centered on them, and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career, subordinating their studies from the first to this end, carefully watching the indications of the course of events, calculating the probable turn that affairs will take, that they may be the first to profit by them. But for his observant curiosity, and the skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris, this story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him, for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things, which was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass.

　　Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry, and a couple of attics. Christophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in one, and Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. Beside the seven inmates thus enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law or medical students dined in the house, as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood. There were usually eighteen people at dinner, and there was room, if need be, for twenty at Mme. Vauquer's table; at breakfast, however, only the seven lodgers appeared. It was almost like a family party. Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers, and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening before; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly confidence.

　　These seven lodgers were Mme. Vauquer's spoiled children. Among them she distributed, with astronomical precision, the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board. One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance. The two second- floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month. Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere; and, as might be expected, poverty, more or less apparent, weighed upon them all, Mme. Couture being the sole exception to the rule.

　　The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house; all were alike threadbare. The color of the men's coats were problematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are only to be seen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self. The women's dresses were faded, old-fashioned, dyed and re-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear, much-mended lace, dingy ruffles, crumpled muslin fichus. So much for their clothing; but, for the most part, their frames were solid enough; their constitutions had weathered the storms of life; their cold, hard faces were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation, but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips. Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these, not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas, but dumb dramas of life, frost-bound dramas that sere hearts like fire, dramas that do not end with the actors' lives.

　　Mlle. Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass, an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl, with its scanty, draggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre and angular was the form beneath it. Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once. What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines? Was it trouble, or vice, or greed? Had she loved too well? Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer, a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses, or had she been merely a courtesan? Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passer-by? Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you; her shriveled face seemed like a menace. Her voice was like the shrill, thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand. She said that she had nursed an old gentleman, ill of catarrh of the bladder, and left to die by his children, who thought that he had nothing left. His bequest to her, a life annuity of a thousand francs, was periodically disputed by his heirs, who mingled slander with their persecutions. In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions, her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue, some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived.

　　M. Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his head a shabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs; the thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobbler's; altogether, his appearance set people wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien. What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled him? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance, which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature? What had he been? Well, perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice, a clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accounts,--so much for providing black veils for parricides, so much for sawdust, so much for pulleys and cord for the knife. Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public slaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of nuisances. Indeed, the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social mill; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do not even know by sight; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean; one of those men, in short, at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that, "After all, we cannot do without them."

　　Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering; but, then, Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it; but no matter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there will always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths, caverns unknown, flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities.

　　Two, however, of Mme. Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest. There was a sickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic girls, in Mlle. Victorine Taillefer's face; and her unvarying expression of sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look, was in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve, which forms a background to this picture; but her face was young, there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements. This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub, newly planted in an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have already begun to wither. The outlines of her figure, revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest materials, were also youthful. There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form, her faintly colored face and light-brown hair, that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes; and a sweet expression, a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes. She was pretty by force of contrast; if she had been happy, she would have been charming. Happiness is the poetry of woman, as the toilette is her tinsel. If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already; if love had put light into the sad eyes, then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second time--pretty dresses and love- letters.

　　A book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her, and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year; he had further taken measures to disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real estate into personalty, that he might leave it undivided to his son. Victorine's mother had died broken-hearted in Mme. Couture's house; and the latter, who was a near relation, had taken charge of the little orphan. Unluckily, the widow of the commissary-general to the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow's pension, and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless, inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world. The good soul, therefore, took Victorine to mass every Sunday, and to confession once a fortnight, thinking that, in any case, she would bring up her ward to be devout. She was right; religion offered a solution of the problem of the young girl's future. The poor child loved the father who refused to acknowledge her. Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mother's message of forgiveness, but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain; her father was inexorable. Her brother, her only means of communication, had not come to see her for four years, and had sent her no assistance; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart, and no accusations mingled with her prayers. Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse, and failed to find words that did justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct; but while they heaped execrations on the millionaire, Victorine's words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove, and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain.

　　Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair complexion, blue eyes, black hair. In his figure, manner, and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family, or that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred. If he was careful of his wardrobe, only taking last year's clothes into daily wear, still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion. Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the limp black cravat, untidily knotted, that students affect, trousers that matched the rest of his costume, and boots that had been resoled.

　　Vautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition stage between these two young people and the others. He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark: "He looks a jovial sort!" He had broad shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong square-fisted hands; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles; there was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner. His bass voice was by no means unpleasant, and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter. He was always obliging, always in good spirits; if anything went wrong with one of the locks, he would soon unscrew it, take it to pieces, file it, oil and clean and set it in order, and put it back in its place again; "I am an old hand at it," he used to say. Not only so, he knew all about ships, the sea, France, foreign countries, men, business, law, great houses and prisons,--there was nothing that he did not know. If any one complained rather more than usual, he would offer his services at once. He had several times lent money to Mme. Vauquer, or to the boarders; but, somehow, those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him; a certain resolute look, sometimes seen on his face, inspired fear of him, for all his appearance of easy good-nature. In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position. His eyes, like those of a pitiless judge, seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions, to read all natures, all feelings and thoughts. His habit of life was very regular; he usually went out after breakfast, returning in time for dinner, and disappeared for the rest of the evening, letting himself in about midnight with a latch key, a privilege that Mme. Vauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he was on very good terms with the widow; he used to call her "mamma," and put his arm round her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the full! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat; but, as a matter of fact, no arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle her.

　　It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it, which he took after dinner. Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in anything that did not directly concern them, would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them. He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none of them had been able to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his occupation. He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature, his unfailing readiness to oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character. He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue, to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency, in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal, as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him, as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life.

　　Mlle. Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength of the one man, and the good looks of the other; her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them seemed to take any notice of her, although some day a chance might alter her position, and she would be a wealthy heiress. For that matter, there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various chronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary, related by the rest. Each one regarded the others with indifference, tempered by suspicion; it was a natural result of their relative positions. Practical assistance not one could give, this they all knew, and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances. They were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to each other. The routine of existence kept them in contact, but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street, not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who did not see in death the solution of the all- absorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others.

　　The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme. Vauquer, who reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions. For her, the little garden, which silence, and cold, and rain, and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian steppe, was a pleasant shaded nook; the gaunt yellow house, the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her, and for her alone. Those cells belonged to her. She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life, and her authority was recognized among them. Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them, and rooms which they were at liberty to make, if not exactly elegant or comfortable, at any rate clean and healthy? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice, the victim would have borne it in silence.

　　Such a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements out of which a complete society might be constructed. And, as in a school, as in the world itself, there was among the eighteen men and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by all the others, condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. At the beginning of Eugene de Rastignac's second twelvemonth, this figure suddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for another two years to come. This laughing-stock was the retired vermicelli-merchant, Father Goriot, upon whose face a painter, like the historian, would have concentrated all the light in his picture.

　　How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half- malignant contempt? Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution, in which there was mingled some pity, but no respect for his misfortunes? Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or absurdity, which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects? The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice. Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure suffering, whether by reason of its genuine humility, or indifference, or sheer helplessness. Do we not, one and all, like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of something? The poorest sample of humanity, the street arab, will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather, and scramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument.

　　In the year 1813, at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, "Father Goriot" had sold his business and retired--to Mme. Vauquer's boarding house. When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Mme. Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more or less was a mere trifle. For him Mme. Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use, in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for the miserable furniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton curtains, a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet, several wretched colored prints in frames, and wall papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained. Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life (they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then) that gave Mme. Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities; she looked on him as an imbecile where money was concerned.

　　Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. Mme. Vauquer's astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric- fronted shirts, the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond, and connected by a short chain, an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker's shirt front. He usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat, and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse. When his hostess accused him of being "a bit of a beau," he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified. His cupboards (ormoires, as he called them in the popular dialect) were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him. The widow's eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles, table-spoons, forks, cruet- stands, tureens, dishes, and breakfast services--all of silver, which were duly arranged upon shelves, besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate, all weighing no inconsiderable number of ounces; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals.

　　"This was my wife's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day," he said to Mme. Vauquer, as he put away a little silver posset dish, with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. "Poor dear! she spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married. Do you know, I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living, madame, than part with that. But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! I am not to be pitied. There's not much fear of my starving for some time to come."

　　Finally, Mme. Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered and read certain entries in the list of shareholders in the funds, and, after a rough calculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with something like ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Mme. Vauquer (nee de Conflans), who, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight summers, though she would only own to thirty-nine of them--Mme. Vauquer had her own ideas. Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets, though they were weak and watery, owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually, she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man. Moreover, the widow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose, indications still further borne out by the worthy man's full-moon countenance and look of stupid good-nature. This, in all probability, was a strongly-build animal, whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection. His hair, worn in ailes de pigeon, and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique, described five points on his low forehead, and made an elegant setting to his face. Though his manners were somewhat boorish, he was always as neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way, like a man who knows that his snuff- box is always likely to be filled with maccaboy, so that when Mme. Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M. Goriot's installation, her heart, like a larded partridge, sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot. She would marry again, sell her boarding-house, give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship, become a lady of consequence in the quarter, and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes; she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy, Soissy, Gentilly; she would have a box at the theatre when she liked, instead of waiting for the author's tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her, in July; the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Mme. Vauquer in her dreams. Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs, accumulated sou by sou, that was her secret; surely as far as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match. "And in other respects, I am quite his equal," she said to herself, turning as if to assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every morning.

　　For three months from that day Mme. Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of M. Goriot's coiffeur, and went to some expense over her toilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such highly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence. She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but people who were in every way select. If a stranger presented himself, she let him know that M. Goriot, one of the best known and most highly- respected merchants in Paris, had singled out her boarding-house for a residence. She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in which it was asserted that hers was "one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter." "From the windows of the house," thus ran the prospectus, "there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins (so there is--from the third floor), and a BEAUTIFUL garden, EXTENDING down to AN AVENUE OF LINDENS at the further end." Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation.

　　It was this prospectus that attracted Mme. la Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil, a widow of six and thirty, who was awaiting the final settlement of her husband's affairs, and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as the wife of a general who had died "on the field of battle." On this Mme. Vauquer saw to her table, lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for nearly six months, and kept the promise of her prospectus, even going to some expense to do so. And the Countess, on her side, addressed Mme. Vauquer as "my dear," and promised her two more boarders, the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel, the late Comte de Picquoisie, who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais, where the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer. Both these ladies, moreover, would be very well to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities. "But Government departments are always so dilatory," the lady added.

　　After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme. Vauquer's room, and had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house. Mme. Vauquer's ideas as to Goriot were cordially approved by Mme. de l'Ambermesnil; it was a capital notion, which for that matter she had guessed from the very first; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man.

　　"Ah! my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as my eyesight--a man who might make a woman happy!" said the widow.

　　The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme. Vauquer's dress, which was not in harmony with her projects. "You must put yourself on a war footing," said she.

　　After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together--they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus equipped for the campaign, the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop; but she herself was so much pleased with the improvement, as she considered it, in her appearance, that she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess; and, though by no means open-handed, she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs. The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot; the countess must sing her praises in his ears. Mme. de l'Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre, began her operations, and succeeded in obtaining a private interview; but the overtures that she made, with a view to securing him for herself, were received with embarrassment, not to say a repulse. She left him, revolted by his coarseness.

　　"My angel," said she to her dear friend, "you will make nothing of that man yonder. He is absurdly suspicious, and he is a mean curmudgeon, an idiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him."

　　After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme. de l'Ambermesnil, the Countess would no longer live under the same roof. She left the next day, forgot to pay for six months' board, and left behind her wardrobe, cast-off clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and persistently as Mme. Vauquer sought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris. The widow often talked of this deplorable business, and regretted her own too confiding disposition. As a matter of fact, she was as suspicious as a cat; but she was like many other people, who cannot trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer--an odd but common phenomenon, whose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart.

　　Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with whom they live; they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates, and in their secret selves they are conscious that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to be judged severely; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess, in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which they have not, hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day. Or, once more, there are other mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a claim upon them, while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to self-love. Such natures feel but little affection for those who are nearest to them; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance, and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits. Mme. Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean, false, and execrable classes.

　　"If I had been there at the time," Vautrin would say at the end of the story, I would have shown her up, and that misfortune would not have befallen you. I know that kind of phiz!"

　　Like all narrow natures, Mme. Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events, and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them about; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on other people, so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune. It had opened her eyes, so she said, with regard to him. As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in vain, and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away, she was not slow to discover the reason of his indifference. It became plain to her at once that there was SOME OTHER ATTRACTION, to use her own expression. In short, it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion, and that she would "never make anything out of that man yonder," in the Countess' forcible phrase. The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character. Mme. Vauquer's aversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship, for her hatred was not in proportion to her love, but to her disappointed expectations. The human heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height of affection, but we seldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred. Still, M. Goriot was a lodger, and the widow's wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath; like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent, she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment, and to gulp down her craving for revenge. Little minds find gratification for their feelings, benevolent or otherwise, by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity. The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a system of covert persecution. She began by a course of retrenchment--various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more.

　　"No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me!" she said to Sylvie one morning, and they returned to the old bill of fare.

　　The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. Soup, boiled beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always would be, the dinner he liked best, so Mme. Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple. He was proof against her malice, and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his expense, and so gratified her desire for revenge.

　　Towards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the owner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress, should be living in her house. Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses? Until the first year was nearly at an end, Goriot had dined out once or twice every week, but these occasions came less frequently, and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner- table twice a month. It was hardly expected that Mme. Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency, when those little excursions of his had been so much to her interest. She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess. It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness.

　　Unluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot's conduct gave some color to the idle talk about him. He asked Mme. Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor, and to make a corresponding reduction in her charges. Apparently, such strict economy was called for, that he did without a fire all through the winter. Mme. Vauquer asked to be paid in advance, an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented, and thenceforward she spoke of him as "Father Goriot."

　　What had brought about this decline and fall? Conjecture was keen, but investigation was difficult. Father Goriot was not communicative; in the sham countess' phrase he was "a curmudgeon." Empty-headed people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them, naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about; so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau was an old rogue. Opinion fluctuated. Sometimes, according to Vautrin, who came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer, Father Goriot was a man who went on 'Change and DABBLED (to use the sufficiently expressive language of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation. Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs. A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at one time, but Vautrin urged that "Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort." There were yet other solutions; Father Goriot was a skinflint, a shark of a money- lender, a man who lived by selling lottery tickets. He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery; yet, however vile his life might be, the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from their society--he paid his way. Besides, Goriot had his uses, every one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words. The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely; this was Mme. Vauquer's view. According to her, the man so well preserved at his time of life, as sound as her eyesight, with whom a woman might be very happy, was a libertine who had strange tastes. These are the facts upon which Mme. Vauquer's slanders were based.

　　Early one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widow's expense, Mme. Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle of a silk dress and a young woman's light footstep on the stair; some one was going to Goriot's room. He seemed to expect the visit, for his door stood ajar. The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be honest, "dressed like a goddess," and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots, had glided in from the street like a snake, had found the kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot's room. Mme. Vauquer and the cook, listening, overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit, which lasted for some time. When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady, the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple, under pretext of going to do her marketing.

　　"M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame," she reported on her return, "to keep her in such style. Just imagine it! There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l'Estrapade, and SHE got into it."

　　While they were at dinner that evening, Mme. Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain, as the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes.

　　"You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot--the sun seeks you out," she said, alluding to his visitor. "Peste! you have good taste; she was very pretty."

　　"That was my daughter," he said, with a kind of pride in his voice, and the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances.

　　A month after this visit M. Goriot received another. The same daughter who had come to see him that morning came again after dinner, this time in evening dress. The boarders, in deep discussion in the dining-room, caught a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender, graceful, and much too distinguished- looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot's.

　　"Two of them!" cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady of the first visit.

　　A few days later, and another young lady--a tall, well-moulded brunette, with dark hair and bright eyes--came to ask for M. Goriot.

　　"Three of them!" said Sylvie.

　　Then the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her father, came shortly afterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress, and came in a carriage.

　　"Four of them!" commented Mme. Vauquer and her plump handmaid. Sylvie saw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her first visit.

　　At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady, and Mme. Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it very knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all inclined to draw a hard-and-fast line, or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits explained her boarder's indifference to her, she went so far (at the end of the second year) as to speak of him as an "ugly old wretch." When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year, she asked him very insolently what he took her house to be, after meeting one of these ladies on he stairs. Father Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter.

　　"So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you?" said Mme. Vauquer sharply.

　　"I have only two," her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who is broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune.

　　Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still further; he went up to the third story, and now paid forty-five francs a month. He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he no longer required his services, and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot appeared for the first time in this condition, an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair--a dingy olive gray. He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble; among all the faces round the table, his was the most woe-begone. There was no longer any doubt. Goriot was an elderly libertine, whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health. The disgusting color of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career. The poor old man's mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him. When his outfit was worn out, he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen sous the ell. His diamonds, his gold snuff-box, watch-chain and trinkets, disappeared one by one. He had left off wearing the corn-flower blue coat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as well as winter, in a coarse chestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and doeskin breeches. He grew thinner and thinner; his legs were shrunken, his cheeks, once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity, were covered with wrinkles, and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible; there were deep furrows in his forehead. In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte- Genevieve he was no longer like his former self. The hale vermicelli manufacturer, sixty-two years of age, who had looked scarce forty, the stout, comfortable, prosperous tradesman, with an almost bucolic air, and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him; the man with something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into his dotage, and had become a feeble, vacillating septuagenarian.

　　The keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel- gray color; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of blood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in others. The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle; and, after teasing him for some time to no purpose, they declared that cretinism was setting in.

　　One evening after dinner Mme. Vauquer said half banteringly to him, "So those daughters of yours don't come to see you any more, eh?" meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity; but Father Goriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword- point.

　　"They come sometimes," he said in a tremulous voice.

　　"Aha! you still see them sometimes?" cried the students. "Bravo, Father Goriot!"

　　The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to his lack of intelligence. If they had only known, they might have been deeply interested by the problem of his condition; but few problems were more obscure. It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot had really been a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable; but the old people, who were most inquisitive as to his concerns, never went beyond the limits of the Quarter, and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock. As for the rest, the current of life in Paris daily awaited them, and swept them away with it; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte- Genevieve, they forgot the existence of the old man, their butt at dinner. For those narrow souls, or for careless youth, the misery in Father Goriot's withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence. As for the creatures whom he called his daughters, all Mme. Vauquer's boarders were of her opinion. With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances, she was wont to reason thus:

　　"If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be, he would not be lodging in my house, on the third floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go about dressed like a poor man."

　　No objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of the month of November 1819, at the time when the curtain rises on this drama, every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter; excesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition; he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe, so one of the dinner contingent, an employe at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of his own. Poiret was an eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot. Poiret would join the talk, argue, answer when he was spoken to; as a matter of fact, his talk, arguments, and responses contributed nothing to the conversation, for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words; still, he did join in the talk; he was alive, and seemed capable of feeling; while Father Goriot (to quote the Museum official again) was invariably at zero--Reaumur.

　　Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers, and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position, that for the time being they rise above the ordinary level.

　　Rastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris. To know its customs; to learn the language, and become familiar with the amusements of the capital, he must explore its recesses, good and bad, follow the studies that please him best, and form some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums.

　　At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. He has his hero, his great man, a professor at the College de France, paid to talk down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat, and strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at the Opera- Comique. As he passes through all these successive initiations, and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of life widen around him, and at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed.

　　If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the Champs-Elysees, he soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners. Unconsciously, Eugene had served his apprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The illusions of childhood had vanished, so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces; he had returned thither with an intelligence developed, with loftier ambitions, and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house. His father and mother, his two brothers and two sisters, with an aged aunt, whose whole fortune consisted in annuities, lived on the little estate of Rastignac. The whole property brought in about three thousand francs; and though the amount varied with the season (as must always be the case in a vine- growing district), they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him. He saw how constantly the poverty, which they had generously hidden from him, weighed upon them; he could not help comparing the sisters, who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had realized the beauty of his dreams. The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him. It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house, nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing; a multitude of small things, which it is useless to speak of in detail here, made him burn to distinguish himself, and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold.

　　He meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing entirely to his merits; but his was pre-eminently a southern temperament, the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea, uncertain how to spend its energies, whither to steer its course, how to adapt its sails to the winds. At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his work, but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and connections; then he saw how great an influence women exert in social life, and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a protectress there. Surely a clever and high- spirited young man, whose wit and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a woman's imagination, need not despair of finding a protectress. These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his sisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. The girls thought him very much changed.

　　His aunt, Mme. de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had moved among the brightest heights of that lofty region. Suddenly the young man's ambition discerned in those recollections of hers, which had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the elements of a social success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit. He began to ask his aunt about those relations; some of the old ties might still hold good. After much shaking of the branches of the family tree, the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish genus of rich relations, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse. To this lady, therefore, she wrote in the old-fashioned style, recommending Eugene to her; pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme. de Beauseant, the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations. A few days after his return to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt's letter to Mme. de Beauseant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening. This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819.

　　A few days later, after Mme. de Beauseant's ball, Eugene came in at two o'clock in the morning. The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight. It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter. The spell of a factitious energy was upon him; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world. He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance, as he had done sometimes on former occasions, after a fete at the Prado, or a ball at the Odeon, splashing his silk stockings thereby, and ruining his pumps.

　　It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door; and Rastignac, coming in at that moment, could go up to his room without making any noise, followed by Christophe, who made a great deal. Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers, kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel, and prepared for his night's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs.

　　Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books. He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion, that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. And not only so, she was, by right of her fortune, and the name she bore, one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world. Thanks to the aunt, thanks to Mme. de Marcillac's letter of introduction, the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him. It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris, and now all doors were open for him. Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly, and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse; he had been content to single out a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities, one of those women who are sure to attract a young man's fancy.

　　The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great dark eyes, a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. There was a fiery energy in her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her "a thoroughbred," "a pure pedigree," these figures of speech have replaced the "heavenly angel" and Ossianic nomenclature; the old mythology of love is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. But for Rastignac, Mme. Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed. He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan, and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille.

　　"Where shall I meet you again, Madame?" he asked abruptly, and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well.

　　"Oh, everywhere!" said she, "in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own house."

　　With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess, making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave him. When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant's, the Countess, whom he took for a great lady, asked him to call at her house, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit. He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance, a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period; the coterie of Maulincourts, Maximes de Trailles, de Marsays, Ronquerolles, Ajuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris--Lady Brandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de Kergarouet, Mme. de Serizy, the Duchesse de Carigliano, the Comtesse Ferraud, Mme. de Lanty, the Marquise d'Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani, the Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d'Espard, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus. Luckily, therefore, for him, the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau, the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais, a general as simple as a child; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder.

　　Ah, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams, and behold two houses open their doors to you! To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d'Antin; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms, conscious that, possessing sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart! To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible, and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles.

　　He sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and Poverty on the other, beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull, smouldering fire. Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugene was doing? who would not have pictured it full of success? His wondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future; he was sitting by Mme. de Restaud's side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph, broke the silence of the night. It vibrated through the student, who took the sound for a death groan. He opened his door noiselessly, went out upon the landing, and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot's door. Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill; he went over and looked through the keyhole; the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker's nocturnal industries.

　　The table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots.

　　"Peste! what a man!" said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot's muscular arms; there was not a sound in the room while the old man, with the aid of the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. "Was he then, indeed, a thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected imbecility and decrepitude, and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely?" Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions, then he looked again through the keyhole.

　　Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table with a blanket, and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar, an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity.

　　"Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland!" said Eugene to himself when the bar was nearly finished.

　　Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his eyes, he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver, and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again.

　　"He is mad," thought the student.

　　"Poor child!" Father Goriot said aloud. Rastignac, hearing those words, concluded to keep silence; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers. Eugene listened; two men there certainly were, he could hear their breathing. Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door, no footsteps in the passage. Suddenly, too, he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story; it came from M. Vautrin's room.

　　"There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house!" he said to himself.

　　He went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of gold reached his ears. In another moment the light was put out, and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no sound of a door being opened or shut. The two men went downstairs, the faint sounds growing fainter as they went.

　　"Who is there?" cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window.

　　"I, Mme. Vauquer," answered Vautrin's deep bass voice. "I am coming in."

　　"That is odd! Christophe drew the bolts," said Eugene, going back to his room. "You have to sit up at night, it seems, if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris."

　　These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he betook himself to his work, but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot's suspicious occupation; Mme. de Restaud's face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists. When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night, the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning. Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty.

　　The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather, and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o'clock. On this morning it was half- past nine, and Mme. Vauquer still lay abed. Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual. It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders' breakfast for her own, and to boil the remainder for some time, so that madame should not discover this illegal exaction.

　　"Sylvie," said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee, "M. Vautrin, who is not such a bad sort, all the same, had two people come to see him again last night. If madame says anything, mind you say nothing about it."

　　"Has he given you something?"

　　"He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying, 'Hold your tongue.' "

　　"Except him and Mme. Couture, who doesn't look twice at every penny, there's no one in the house that doesn't try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year," said Sylvie.

　　"And, after all," said Christophe, "what do they give you? A miserable five-franc piece. There is Father Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret, who goes without blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots. Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student, who gives me a couple of francs, Two francs will not pay for my brushes, and he sells his old clothes, and gets more for them than they are worth. Oh! they're a shabby lot!"

　　"Pooh!" said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, "our places are the best in the Quarter, that I know. But about that great big chap Vautrin, Christophe; has any one told you anything about him?"

　　"Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me, 'There's a gentleman in your place, isn't there? a tall man that dyes his whiskers?' I told him, 'No, sir; they aren't dyed. A gay fellow like him hasn't the time to do it.' And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards, he said, 'Quite right, my boy. That is the way to answer them. There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known; it might spoil many a match.' "

　　"Well, and for my part," said Sylvie, "a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh! There," she cried, interrupting herself, "that's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grace, and not a soul stirring!"

　　"Pooh! they are all gone out. Mme. Couture and the girl went out at eight o'clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne. Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel, and the student won't be back from his lecture till ten o'clock. I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs; Father Goriot knocked up against me, and his parcel was as hard as iron. What is the old fellow up to, I wonder? He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them; they can never let him alone; but he is a good man, all the same, and worth more than all of them put together. He doesn't give you much himself, but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips; they are dressed grandly, too."

　　"His daughters, as he calls them, eh? There are a dozen of them."

　　"I have never been to more than two--the two who came here."

　　"There is madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will raise a fine racket. Just keep an eye on the milk, Christophe; don't let the cat get at it."

　　Sylvie went up to her mistress' room.

　　"Sylvie! How is this? It's nearly ten o'clock, and you let me sleep like a dormouse! Such a thing has never happened before."

　　"It's the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife."

　　"But how about breakfast?"

　　"Bah! the boarders are possessed, I'm sure. They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight."

　　"Do speak properly, Sylvie," Mme. Vauquer retorted; "say a blink of daylight."

　　"Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. Anyhow, you can have breakfast at ten o'clock. La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred. There are only those two upstairs, and they are sleeping like the logs they are."

　　"But, Sylvie, you put their names together as if----"

　　"As if what?" said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. "The two of them make a pair."

　　"It is a strange thing, isn't it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door?"

　　"Not at all, madame. Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and undid the door. And here are you imagining that----?"

　　"Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears on the table, those at five a penny."

　　A few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down, just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap in all haste.

　　"Mistigris!" she cried.

　　The cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.

　　"Oh! yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite!" she said. "Sylvie! Sylvie!"

　　"Yes, madame; what is it?"

　　"Just see what the cat has done!"

　　"It is all that stupid Christophe's fault. I told him to stop and lay the table. What has become of him? Don't you worry, madame; Father Goriot shall have it. I will fill it up with water, and he won't know the difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats."

　　"I wonder where the old heathen can have gone?" said Mme. Vauquer, setting the plates round the table.

　　"Who knows? He is up to all sorts of tricks."

　　"I have overslept myself," said Mme. Vauquer.

　　"But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same."

　　The door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the sitting-room, singing loudly:

　　" 'Tis the same old story everywhere,   A roving heart and a roving glance . .

　　"Oh! Mamma Vauquer! good-morning!" he cried at the sight of his hostess, and he put his arm gaily round her waist.

　　"There! have done----"

　　" 'Impertinence!' Say it!" he answered. "Come, say it! Now, isn't that what you really mean? Stop a bit, I will help you to set the table. Ah! I am a nice man, am I not?

　　"For the locks of brown and the golden hair   A sighing lover . . .

　　"Oh! I have just seen something so funny----

　　. . . . led by chance."

　　"What?" asked the widow.

　　"Father Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning. They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there, and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum. It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that's not used to the trade."

　　"Really? You don't say so?"

　　"Yes. One of my friends is expatriating himself; I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer, and was coming back here. I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do; it is a comical affair. He came back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des Gres, and went into a money-lender's house; everybody knows him, Gobseck, a stuck-up rascal, that would make dominoes out of his father's bones, a Turk, a heathen, an old Jew, a Greek; it would be a difficult matter to rob HIM, for he puts all his coin into the Bank."

　　"Then what was Father Goriot doing there?"

　　"Doing?" said Vautrin. "Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. He is a simpleton, stupid enough to ruin himself by running after----"

　　"There he is!" cried Sylvie.

　　"Christophe," cried Father Goriot's voice, "come upstairs with me."

　　Christophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again.

　　"Where are you going?" Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant.

　　"Out on an errand for M. Goriot."

　　"What may that be?" said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe's hand. "Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud," he read. "Where are you going with it?" he added, as he gave the letter back to Christophe.

　　"To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands myself."

　　"What is there inside it?" said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the light. "A banknote? No." He peered into the envelope. "A receipted account!" he cried. "My word! 'tis a gallant old dotard. Off with you, old chap," he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe's head, and spinning the man round like a thimble; "you will have a famous tip."

　　By this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk, Mme. Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin, who kept humming to himself:

　　"The same old story everywhere,   A roving heart and a roving glance."

　　When everything was ready, Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.

　　"Where have you been this morning, fair lady?" said Mme. Vauquer, turning to Mme. Couture.

　　"We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer. Poor little thing! She is trembling like a leaf," Mme. Couture went on, as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.

　　"Warm yourself, Victorine," said Mme. Vauquer.

　　"It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to soften your father's heart," said Vautrin, as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl; "but that is not enough. What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has three millions (so they say), and will not give you a dowry; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays."

　　"Poor child!" said Mme. Vauquer. "Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself."

　　Victorine's eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked herself at a sign from Mme. Couture.

　　"If we could only see him!" said the Commissary-General's widow; "if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife's last letter! I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knew my handwriting----"

　　" 'Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!' " exclaimed Vautrin, breaking in upon her. "So that is how you are, is it? In a few days' time I will look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you shall see."

　　"Oh! sir," said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin, who showed no sign of being touched by it, "if you know of any way of communicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the world. If you can induce him to relent a little towards me, I will pray to God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude----"

　　"The same old story everywhere," sang Vautrin, with a satirical intonation. At this juncture, Goriot, Mlle. Michonneau, and Poiret came downstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven people thus assembled bade each other good- morning, and took their places at the table; the clock struck ten, and the student's footstep was heard outside.

　　"Ah! here you are, M. Eugene," said Sylvie; "every one is breakfasting at home to-day."

　　The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside Goriot.

　　"I have just met with a queer adventure," he said, as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton, and cut a slice of bread, which Mme. Vauquer's eyes gauged as usual.

　　"An adventure?" queried Poiret.

　　"Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy?" Vautrin asked of Poiret. "M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing."

　　Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.

　　"Tell us about your adventure!" demanded M. Vautrin.

　　"Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant. She has a magnificent house; the rooms are hung with silk--in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as happy as a king---"

　　"Fisher," put in Vautrin, interrupting.

　　"What do you mean, sir?" said Eugene sharply.

　　"I said 'fisher,' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings."

　　"Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king," said Poiret the ditto-ist, "because----"

　　"In fact"--the law-student cut him short--"I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room, a charming countess, the most exquisite creature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her hair, and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers--real flowers, that scented the air----but there! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance. You ought to have seen her! Well, and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o'clock, on foot in the Rue de Gres. Oh! how my heart beat! I began to think----"

　　"That she was coming here," said Vautrin, with a keen look at the student. "I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck, a money-lender. If ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart, you will find the money-lender first, and the lover afterwards. Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud, and she lives in the Rue du Helder."

　　The student stared hard at Vautrin. Father Goriot raised his head at the words, and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.

　　"Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him!" cried Goriot, with anguish in his voice.

　　"It is just as I guessed," said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in Mme. Vauquer's ear.

　　Goriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he was doing. He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment.

　　"Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin?" asked Eugene.

　　"Aha! there you are!" answered Vautrin. "Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well! and why should I not know it too?"

　　"M. Goriot?" the student cried.

　　"What is it?" asked the old man. "So she was very beautiful, was she, yesterday night?"

　　"Who?"

　　"Mme. de Restaud."

　　"Look at the old wretch," said Mme. Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; "how his eyes light up!"

　　"Then does he really keep her?" said Mlle. Michonneau, in a whisper to the student.

　　"Oh! yes, she was tremendously pretty," Eugene answered. Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes. "If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there, my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list, and she danced every quadrille. The other women were furious. She must have enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a galloping horse, or a woman dancing."

　　"So the wheel turns," said Vautrin; "yesterday night at a duchess' ball, this morning in a money-lender's office, on the lowest rung of the ladder--just like a Parisienne! If their husbands cannot afford to pay for their frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. Or if they cannot do that, they will tear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor. They will turn the world upside down. Just a Parisienne through and through!"

　　Father Goriot's face, which had shone at the student's words like the sun on a bright day, clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin's.

　　"Well," said Mme. Vauquer, "but where is your adventure? Did you speak to her? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law?"

　　"She did not see me," said Eugene. "But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o'clock! She could not have reached home after the ball till two o'clock this morning. Wasn't it queer? There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures."

　　"Pshaw! much funnier things than THAT happen here!" exclaimed Vautrin.

　　Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make. Mme. Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress; the two ladies went out, and Father Goriot followed their example.

　　"Well, did you see?" said Mme. Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle. "He is ruining himself for those women, that is plain."

　　"Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot," cried the student.

　　"Well, and if you don't," broke in Vautrin, "we are not set on convincing you. You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion----"

　　Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper's horse. "Aha!" said Vautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance, "so we have had our little experiences, have we?"

　　The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.

　　"Well," he went on, "when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads, they cannot drop it. They must drink the water from some particular spring--it is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell their wives and families, they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it. For some this spring is play, or the stock-exchange, or music, or a collection of pictures or insects; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like. You might offer these last all the women on earth--they would turn up their noses; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion. It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all, and treats them cruelly; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear; but no matter, the fools are never tired of it; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker's to give their last five-franc piece to her. Father Goriot here is one of that sort. He is discreet, so the Countess exploits him--just the way of the gay world. The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else. In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal; but get him on that subject, and his eyes sparkle like diamonds. That secret is not difficult to guess. He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot, and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck's in the Rue des Gres. And now, mark what follows--he came back here, and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe, who showed us the address; there was a receipted bill inside it. It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender. Father Goriot has financed her handsomely. There is no need to tack a tale together; the thing is self-evident. So that shows you, sir student, that all the time your Countess was smiling, dancing, flirting, swaying her peach-flower crowned head, with her gown gathered into her hand, her slippers were pinching her, as they say; she was thinking of her protested bills, or her lover's protested bills."

　　"You have made me wild to know the truth," cried Eugene; "I will go to call on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow."

　　"Yes," echoed Poiret; "you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud."

　　"And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there, who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered."

　　Eugene looked disgusted. "Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough."

　　"And an uncommonly queer slough, too," replied Vautrin. "The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage--you are a respectable person; you go afoot and are splashed--you are a scoundrel. You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else, and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice, for the maintenance of law and order! A pretty slate of things it is!"

　　"What," cried Mme. Vauquer, "has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish?"

　　"There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not?" asked Eugene.

　　"Yes, that there were."

　　"Then, was he fond of it?" said Eugene. "He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate. I happened to see him by accident."

　　"It was dear to him as his own life," answered the widow.

　　"There! you see how infatuated the old fellow is!" cried Vautrin. "The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him"

　　The student went up to his room. Vautrin went out, and a few moments later Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them. Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau, and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes.

　　"Well, those two are as good as married," was the portly Sylvie's comment. "They are going out together to-day for the first time. They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel."

　　"Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau's shawl, then, said Mme. Vauquer, laughing; "it would flare up like tinder."

　　At four o'clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the light of two smoky lamps, that Victorine's eyes were red. Mme. Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer; it had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them.

　　"My dear lady," said Mme. Couture, addressing Mme. Vauquer, "just imagine it; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down, she was standing the whole time. He said to me quite coolly, without putting himself in a passion, that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there; that the young lady (he would not call her his daughter) was injuring her cause by importuning him (IMPORTUNING! once a year, the wretch!); that as Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her, Victorine ought not to expect anything from him; in fact, he said the most cruel things, that made the poor child burst out crying. The little thing threw herself at her father's feet and spoke up bravely; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother's sake; that she would obey him without a murmur, but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother's farewell letter. She took it up and gave it to him, saying the most beautiful things in the world, most beautifully expressed; I do not know where she learned them; God

　　must have put them into her head, for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk. And what do you think the monster was doing all the time? Cutting his nails! He took the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with tears, and flung it on to the chimney-piece. 'That is all right,' he said. He held out his hands to raise his daughter, but she covered them with kisses, and he drew them away again. Scandalous, isn't it? And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister."

　　"What inhuman wretches they must be!" said Father Goriot.

　　"And then they both went out of the room," Mme. Couture went on, without heeding the worthy vermicelli maker's exclamation; "father and son bowed to me, and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business! That is the history of our call. Well, he has seen his daughter at any rate. How he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot think, for they are as alike as two peas."

　　The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty. Dulness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. This kind of argot is always changing. The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a street song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a month. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention, which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with RAMA. The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders.

　　"Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret," said the employe from the Museum, "how is your health-orama?" Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to Mme. Couture and Victorine with a "Ladies, you seem melancholy."

　　"Is dinner ready?" cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a friend of Rastignac's; "my stomach is sinking usque ad talones."

　　"There is an uncommon frozerama outside," said Vautrin. "Make room there, Father Goriot! Confound it, your foot covers the whole front of the stove."

　　"Illustrious M. Vautrin," put in Bianchon, "why do you say frozerama? It is incorrect; it should be frozenrama."

　　"No, it shouldn't," said the official from the Museum; "frozerama is right by the same rule that you say 'My feet are froze.' "

　　"Ah! ah!"

　　"Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of Contraries," cried Bianchon, seizing Eugene by the throat, and almost throttling him.

　　"Hallo there! hallo!"

　　Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party, and took her place beside the three women without saying a word.

　　"That old bat always makes me shudder," said Bianchon in a low voice, indicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin. "I have studied Gall's system, and I am sure she has the bump of Judas."

　　"Then you have seen a case before?" said Vautrin.

　　"Who has not?" answered Bianchon. "Upon my word, that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through, give them time enough."

　　"That is the way, young man," returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers:

　　"The rose has lived the life of a rose--   A morning's space."

　　"Aha! here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama," cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed.

　　"I beg your pardon, sir," said Mme. Vauquer; "it is soupe aux choux."

　　All the young men roared with laughter.

　　"Had you there, Poiret!"

　　"Poir-r-r-rette! she had you there!"

　　"Score two points to Mamma Vauquer," said Vautrin.

　　"Did any of you notice the fog this morning?" asked the official.

　　"It was a frantic fog," said Bianchon, "a fog unparalleled, doleful, melancholy, sea-green, asthmatical--a Goriot of a fog!"

　　"A Goriorama," said the art student, "because you couldn't see a thing in it."

　　"Hey! Milord Gaoriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou!"

　　Father Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door through which the servant entered, raised his face; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times.

　　"Well," Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices, "and is there anything the matter with the bread?"

　　"Nothing whatever, madame," he answered; "on the contrary, it is made of the best quality of corn; flour from Etampes."

　　"How could you tell?" asked Eugene.

　　"By the color, by the flavor."

　　"You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose," said Mme. Vauquer. "You have grown so economical, you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last."

　　"Take out a patent for it, then," cried the Museum official; "you would make a handsome fortune."

　　"Never mind him," said the artist; "he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker."

　　"Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears?" inquired the official.

　　"Corn WHAT?" asked Bianchon.

　　"Corn-el."

　　"Corn-et."

　　"Corn-elian."

　　"Corn-ice."

　　"Corn-ucopia."

　　"Corn-crake."

　　"Corn-cockle."

　　"Corn-orama."

　　The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room, and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look, like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand.

　　"Corn? . . ." he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor.

　　"Corn on your foot, old man!" said Vautrin, and he drove Father Goriot's cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown.

　　The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything. Christophe carried off his plate, thinking that he had finished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out laughing. "You are a disagreeable joker, sir," said the old man, "and if you take any further liberties with me----"

　　"Well, what then, old boy?" Vautrin interrupted.

　　"Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day----"

　　"Down below, eh?" said the artist, "in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys."

　　"Well, mademoiselle," Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, "you are eating nothing. So papa was refractory, was he?"

　　"A monster!" said Mme. Couture.

　　"Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she is not eating anything. Eh! eh! just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle. Victorine."

　　The old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable,--the slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her.

　　"We are mistaken about Father Goriot, my dear boy," said Eugene in a low voice. "He is not an idiot, nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall system on him, and let me know what you think. I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to be something extra-ordinary going on in his mind just now, to judge by his face. His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying. Oh! you may laugh, Bianchon; I am not joking."

　　"The man is a subject, is he?" said Bianchon; "all right! I will dissect him, if he will give me the chance."

　　"No; feel his bumps."

　　"Hm!--his stupidity might perhaps be contagious."

　　The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three o'clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud. On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers; they see success in every direction; imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a romance; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy. If youth were not ignorant and timid, civilization would be impossible.

　　Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition, but on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de Restaud and what he should say to her. He equipped himself with wit, rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and prepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand, conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud, and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed.

　　"If I were rich," he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen, "I would take a cab, then I could think at my ease."

　　At last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud. He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants, who had seen him cross the court on foot, with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of their glances at once, for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court, where a smart cab was waiting. All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance. A fine horse, in magnificent harness, was pawing the ground, and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself. Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast; he grew positively stupid. He sent up his name to the Countess, and waited in the ante-chamber, standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash, and stared before him. The time seemed long; he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded.

　　"Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir," said the servant. "She gave me no answer; but if you will go into the dining-room, there is some one already there."

　　Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber, meaning, no doubt, to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers, where lamps were standing, and hot-water pipes, on which towels were being dried; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it. Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion.

　　"This way to the drawing-room, sir," said the servant, with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense.

　　Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good luck, he managed to keep his hat on his head, and saved it from immersion in the water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the further end of the dark passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp. Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss; one of the speakers was Mme. de Restaud, the other was Father Goriot. Eugene followed the servant through the dining-room into the drawing- room; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard, and stood there for a while. He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew. His heart beat unwontedly fast; he remembered Vautrin's hideous insinuations. A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it, saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door: "I am going, Maurice. Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her."

　　Whereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be insolent, sang an Italian trill, and went towards the window where Eugene was standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.

　　"But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; madame is disengaged," said Maurice, as he returned to the ante-chamber.

　　Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a ribbon at his button-hole was seated. Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself. The horse took fright at the umbrella, swerved, and dashed forward towards the flight of steps. The young man looked round in annoyance, saw Father Goriot, and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy, such as people usually show to a money- lender so long as they require his services, or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon, so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance. Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile. All this happened with lightning speed. Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess' voice.

　　"Oh! Maxime, were you going away?" she said reproachfully, with a shade of pique in her manner. The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head, as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning; there was a soft fragrance about her--doubtless she was fresh from a bath;--her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty more luxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young man can see everything at a glance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness. He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving glimpses of a bare throat, on which the student's eyes rested. The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge to love; her feet, thrust into slippers, were daintily small. As Maxime took her hand and kissed it, Eugene became aware of Maxime's existence, and the Countess saw Eugene.

　　"Oh! is that you M. de Rastignac? I am very glad to see you," she said, but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart.

　　Maxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing, looked from Eugene to the lady, and from the lady to Eugene; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words: "Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business."

　　The Countess consulted the young man's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman's heart, and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with, the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous; Maxime's boots, moreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all his care, bore some traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Maxime's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully, he looked like a pretty woman, while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two. The quick- witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the clear gaze and the pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple. Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight, so that she looked like a white butterfly, and Maxime hurried after her. Eugene, in a fury, followed Maxime and the Countess, and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de Restaud, he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant's ball; he guessed the relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success, he said to himself, "This is my rival; I mean to cut him out."

　　Rash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man. Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the bulls's eye twenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily, that Anastasie's fair face suddenly clouded over. She turned to Eugene, with a cool, questioning glance that asked plainly, "Why do you not go?" a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit.

　　Eugene assumed an amiable expression.

　　"Madame," he began, "I hastened to call upon you----"

　　He stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared. He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the Countess; he looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial "Good morning," that astonished Eugene not a little. The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance.

　　"M. de Restaud," said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law student.

　　Eugene bowed profoundly.

　　"This gentleman," she continued, presenting Eugene to her husband, "is M. de Rastignac; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball."

　　Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs! These words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis, by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house, produced a magical effect. The Count's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student's bow.

　　"Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance," he said.

　　Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance, and suddenly dropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a fairy's wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again; Rastignac's carefully drilled faculties returned. It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris, and he began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet. Mme. Vauquer's lodging- house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts.

　　"I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct," the Comte de Restaud said, addressing Eugene.

　　"Yes, they are extinct," answered the law student. "My great- uncle, the Chevalier de Rastignac, married the heiress of the Marcillac family. They had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de Clarimbault, Mme. de Beauseant's grandfather on the mother's side. We are the younger branch of the family, and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he had in the King's service. The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated."

　　"Was not your great-uncle in command of the Vengeur before 1789?"

　　"Yes."

　　"Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the Warwick."

　　Maxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who should say, "If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow, it is all over with us." Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles gave her. With a woman's admirable tact, she began to smile and said:

　　"Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the Vengeur."

　　She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and mischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of the boudoir. The morganatic couple (to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene.

　　"Anastasie!" he cried pettishly, "just stay a moment, dear; you know very well that----"

　　"I am coming back in a minute," she interrupted; "I have a commission for Maxime to execute, and I want to tell him about it."

　　She came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in her husband's voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands' characters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life. It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation. M. de Trailles addressed the Count, the Countess, and Eugene with the pointed remark, "You are busy, I do not want to interrupt you; good-day," and he went.

　　"Just wait a moment, Maxime!" the Count called after him.

　　"Come and dine with us," said the Countess, leaving Eugene and her husband together once more. She followed Maxime into the little drawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had taken his leave.

　　The law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses in their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers for M. de Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Father Goriot. This Countess with a husband and a lover, for Maxime clearly was her lover, was a mystery. What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant to penetrate, hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian.

　　"Anastasie!" the Count called again to his wife.

　　"Poor Maxime!" she said, addressing the young man. "Come, we must resign ourselves. This evening----"

　　"I hope, Nasie," he said in her ear, "that you will give orders not to admit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at you. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and then you will compel me to kill him."

　　"Are you mad, Maxime?" she said. "A young lad of a student is, on the contrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him."

　　Maxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip, and made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had been closed after him.

　　"What do you think, dear?" cried the Count, her husband, "this gentleman's family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted."

　　"Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common," said the Countess, with a preoccupied manner.

　　"More than you think," said Eugene, in a low voice.

　　"What do you mean?" she asked quickly.

　　"Why, only just now," said the student, "I saw a gentleman go out at the gate, Father Goriot, my next door neighbor in the house where I am lodging."

　　At the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the Count, who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers, and rose to his feet.

　　"Sir," he cried, "you might have called him 'Monsieur Goriot'!"

　　The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband's vexation, then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of assumed carelessness:

　　"You could not know any one who is dearer to us both . . ."

　　She broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind, and asked, "Are you fond of music, M. de Rastignac?"

　　"Exceedingly," answered Eugene, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.

　　"Do you sing?" she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down before it, she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end. R-r-r-rah!

　　"No, madame."

　　The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.

　　"That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.--Ca- ro, ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re," sang the Countess.

　　Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot's name, but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula "related to Mme. de Beauseant." His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures, and three or four heads, imperfectly secured, fall at the shock. He wished the earth would open and swallow him. Mme. de Restaud's expression was reserved and chilly, her eyes had grown indifferent, and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law.

　　"Madame," he said, "you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to wish you good-day----"

　　The Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, "Whenever you come to see us, both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you."

　　Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de Restaud, who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying him into the hall.

　　"Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls," the Count said to Maurice.

　　As Eugene set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.

　　"Come," said he to himself, "somehow I have just made a mess of it, I do not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go into society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs, varnished boots, gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and primrose kid gloves every evening? A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot!"

　　When he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employer's knowledge, saw that Eugene had no umbrella, remarked his black coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished boots, and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. Eugene, in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss, as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths, nodded in reply to the driver's signal, and stepped into the cab; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party.

　　"Where am I to drive, sir?" demanded the man, who, by this time, had taken off his white gloves.

　　"Confound it!" Eugene said to himself, "I am in for it now, and at least I will not spend cab-hire for nothing!--Drive to the Hotel Beauseant," he said aloud.

　　"Which?" asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugene to confusion. This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know that there were two Hotels Beauseant; he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about him.

　　"The Vicomte de Beauseant, Rue----"

　　"De Grenelle," interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. "You see, there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue Saint-Dominique," he added, drawing up the step.

　　"I know all about that," said Eugene, severely.--"Everybody is laughing at me to-day, it seems!" he said to himself, as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat. "This escapade will cost me a king's ransom, but, at any rate, I shall call on my so- called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion. Goriot has cost me ten francs already, the old scoundrel. My word! I will tell Mme. de Beauseant about my adventure; perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail. It would be better to find favor in my cousin's eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman, who seems to me to have very expensive tastes. Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse's personal interest would turn the scale for me, when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect. Let us look higher. If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven, you must face God."

　　The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases. He grew calmer, and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him, the money was well laid out in preserving his coat, boots, and hat; and his cabman's cry of "Gate, if you please," almost put him in spirits. A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great door groaned on its hinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction, beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning. The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat, dismounted and let down the step. As Eugene stepped out of the cab, he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with powdered hair, seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses, who stood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Restaud's courtyard, in the Chaussee d'Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it.

　　"Who can be here?" said Eugene to himself. He began to understand, though somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed. "Confound it all! I expect my cousin also has her Maxime."

　　He went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass door was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb. So far, Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant; the fete had followed so closely on the invitation, that he had not had time to call on his cousin, and had therefore never seen Mme. de Beauseant's apartments; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life. He was the more curious, because Mme. de Restaud's drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison.

　　At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin, but Eugene knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He was conducted up the wide, white-painted, crimson- carpeted staircase, between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants, to Mme. de Beauseant's apartments. He did not know the rumor current about Mme. de Beauseant, one of the biographies told, with variations, in whispers, every evening in the salons of Paris.

　　For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto. It was one of those innocent liaisons which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de Beauseant, therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic union. Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto there. As, under the circumstances, Mme. de Beauseant could not very well shut her door against these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception, and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became known in Paris that Mme. de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four o'clock, she was left in perfect solitude during that interval. She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M. d'Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauseant, like a well-bred man of the world, always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed them. But M. d'Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a Mlle. de Rochefide was the young lady. In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and that was Mme. de Beauseant. Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility, and she had laughed at them, believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief. And now, though the bans were about to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery. How was it? Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind. There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after two hours of lamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead swoon and requires salts. At this moment, therefore, M. d'Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns, and anxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Mme. de Beauseant; he would write, it would be much better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart.

　　So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil's courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was impossible, therefore, that Mme. de Beauseant should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was appalling in its artlessness.

　　Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner, and of its owner's wife and family, so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation, "Harness five bullocks to your cart!" probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you. If, down to the present day, our language has no name for these conversational disasters, it is probably because they are believed to be impossible, the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. After the awkward incident at Mme. de Restaud's, no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de Beauseant's drawing-room. But if Mme. de Restaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way, M. d'Ajuda hailed his coming with relief.

　　"Good-bye," said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugene made his entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing- room, where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste.

　　"Until this evening," said Mme. de Beauseant, turning her head to give the Marquis a glance. "We are going to the Bouffons, are we not?"

　　"I cannot go," he said, with his fingers on the door handle.

　　Mme. de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay the slightest attention to Eugene, who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to hide himself, when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand, and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her. The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came back towards her. Eugene watched him, not without a feeling of envy.

　　"That is the owner of the brougham!" he said to himself. "But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?"

　　The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins, his throat was parched with the thirst of gold.

　　He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother, brothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among them. This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.

　　"Why not?" the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese. "Why cannot you come to the Italiens?"

　　"Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador."

　　"Throw him over."

　　When a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to add lie to lie. M. d'Ajuda therefore said, smiling, "Do you lay your commands on me?"

　　"Yes, certainly."

　　"That was what I wanted to have you say to me," he answered, dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman.

　　He took the Vicomtesse's hand, kissed it, and went.

　　Eugene ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to bow. He thought that now Mme. de Beauseant would give him her attention; but suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the gallery, and watched M. d'Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened to the order that he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman:

　　"To M. de Rochefide's house."

　　Those words, and the way in which M. d'Ajuda flung himself back in the carriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. The most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse went to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper.

　　"When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador,"   she wrote, "you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an   explanation, which I am waiting to hear."

　　She retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C for "Claire de Bourgogne," and rang the bell.

　　"Jacques," she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, "take this note to M. de Rochefide's house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis d'Ajuda. If M. d'Ajuda is there, leave the note without waiting for an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me."

　　"Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room."

　　"Ah! yes, of course," she said, opening the door.

　　Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the Vicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart.

　　"Pardon me, monsieur," she said; "I had a letter to write. Now I am quite at liberty."

　　She scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she thought, "Ah! he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide? But is he still free? This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else . . . But before to-morrow I shall know."

　　"Cousin . . ." the student replied.

　　"Eh?" said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugene; he understood what that "Eh?" meant; he had learned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert. He reddened:

　　"Madame . . ." he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on. "Pardon me; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harm."

　　Mme. de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst.

　　"If you knew how my family are situated," he went on, "you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege."

　　"Well, cousin," she said, laughing, "and how can I be of service to you?"

　　"But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me. You have confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant to say to you. I know no one else here in Paris. . . . Ah! if I could only ask you to counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his life for you."

　　"Would you kill a man for me?"

　　"Two," said Eugene.

　　"You, child. Yes, you are a child," she said, keeping back the tears that came to her eyes; "you would love sincerely."

　　"Oh!" he cried, flinging up his head.

　　The audacity of the student's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him. The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between Mme. de Restaud's blue boudoir and Mme. de Beauseant's rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years' advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of every kind.

　　"Ah! that is what I meant to say!" said Eugene. "I met Mme. de Restaud at your ball, and this morning I went to see her.

　　"You must have been very much in the way," said Mme. de Beauseant, smiling as she spoke.

　　"Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one against me, if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me, what you women can explain so well--life. I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere. So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle, to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning. I mentioned an old man----"

　　"Madame la Duchess de Langeais," Jacques cut the student short; Eugene gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.

　　"If you mean to succeed," said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, "in the first place you must not be so demonstrative."

　　"Ah! good morning, dear," she continued, and rising and crossing the room, she grasped the Duchess' hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way.

　　"Two intimate friends!" said Rastignac to himself. "Henceforward I shall have two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no doubt, and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend's cousin."

　　"To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear Antoinette?" asked Mme. de Beauseant.

　　"Well, I saw M. d'Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide's door, so I thought that if I came I should find you alone."

　　Mme. de Beauseant's mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her expression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words.

　　"If I had known that you were engaged----" the speaker added, glancing at Eugene.

　　"This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac, one of my cousins," said the Vicomtesse. "Have you any news of General de Montriveau?" she continued. "Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now; has he been to see you to-day?"

　　It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Montriveau, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question in her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:

　　"He was at the Elysee yesterday."

　　"In attendance?"

　　"Claire," returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Mme. de Beauseant; "of course you know that M. d'Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide; the bans will be published to-morrow."

　　This thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse's face grew white, but she answered, laughing, "One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with. What should induce M. d'Ajuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday."

　　"But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say."

　　"M. d'Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money."

　　"But, my dear, Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl."

　　"Indeed?"

　　"And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing is settled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it."

　　Mme. de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. "What was the blunder that you made, monsieur?" she asked. "The poor boy is only just launched into the world, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk to-morrow. Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation."

　　The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot, and leave him crushed and annihilated.

　　"Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud's heart; unwittingly--therein lies my offence," said the student of law, whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. "You continue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities, and every one despise him."

　　Mme. de Beauseant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm to the law student, who was still smarting under the Duchess' insolent scrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value.

　　"Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud; for I should tell you, madame," he went on, turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, "that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world, and very poor----"

　　"You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. We women never care about anything that no one else will take."

　　"Bah!" said Eugene. "I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides, I am confessing my sins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive absolution for them in another."

　　The Duchess' expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with--"This gentleman has only just come----"

　　Mme. de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both.

　　"He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in good taste."

　　"Mme. la Duchesse," said Eugene, "is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us?" ("Come, now," he said to himself, "my language is superfinely elegant, I'm sure.")

　　"But Mme. de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles' pupil," said the Duchess.

　　"Of that I had no idea, madame," answered the law student, "so I rashly came between them. In fact, I got on very well with the lady's husband, and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase, a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage."

　　"Who was it?" both women asked together.

　　"An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly unfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him--we all call him 'Father Goriot.' "

　　"Why, child that you are," cried the Vicomtesse, "Mme. de Restaud was a Mlle. Goriot!"

　　"The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer," the Duchess added; "and when the little creature went to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire? The King began to laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People--what was it?--people----"

　　"Ejusdem farinae," said Eugene.

　　"Yes, that was it," said the Duchess.

　　"Oh! is that her father?" the law student continued, aghast.

　　"Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so to speak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him."

　　"Didn't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?" the Vicomtesse asked, turning to Mme. de Langeais, "a Baron de Nucingen? And her name is Delphine, is it not? Isn't she a fair- haired woman who has a side-box at the Opera? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and laughs loudly to attract attention."

　　The Duchess smiled and said:

　　"I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was, to be infatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh! he will not find her a good bargain! She is in M. de Trailles' hands, and he will ruin her."

　　"And they do not acknowledge their father!" Eugene repeated.

　　"Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father," replied the Vicomtesse, "a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying them well; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself, thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters, thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that in their houses he should find two homes, where he would be loved and looked up to, and made much of. And in two years' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts."

　　Tears came into Eugene's eyes. He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence.

　　"Eh, mon Dieu!" said Mme. de Langeais; "yes, it seems very horrible, and yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for it? Tell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little one, bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family, its 'white soul,' as Lamartine says, and suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and takes her from us, his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling's heart, and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father, as we had no thought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son, and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence. On the other hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife's mother out of the house. I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come to be very poor farces. I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli maker's case. I think I recollect that Foriot----"

　　"Goriot, madame."

　　"Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution. He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My grandmother's steward sold him immense quantities. No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation, as that sort of person always did. I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security, because her corn was as good as a certificate of civism. Well, then, this Loriot, who sold corn to those butchers, has never had but one passion, they say--he idolizes his daughters. He settled one of them under Restaud's roof, and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree, the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist. You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was Emperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Restaud felt bored by the old man's society, and the banker was still more tired of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted 'to keep the goat and the cabbage,' so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there, under pretence of affection. 'Come to- day, papa, we shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much nicer!' and all that sort of thing. As for me, dear, I believe that love has second-sight: poor Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief. So he immolated himself. He made the sacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary exile. His daughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done the best thing he could; but it was a family crime, and father and daughters were accomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere. What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters' drawing-rooms? He would only have been in the way, and bored other people, besides being bored himself. And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in

　　Paris and the man she loves the best; if her love grows tiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her. It is the same with all love and friendship. Our heart is a treasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are bankrupt. We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left. Their father had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune too. The lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in the gutter."

　　"The world is very base," said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads of her shawl. She did not raise her head as she spoke; the words that Mme. de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the quick.

　　"Base? Oh, no," answered the Duchess; "the world goes its own way, that is all. If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not duped by it. I think as you do," she said, pressing the Vicomtesse's hand. "The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above it."

　　She rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauseant on the forehead as she said: "You look very charming to-day, dear. I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before."

　　Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.

　　"Father Goriot is sublime!" said Eugene to himself, as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night.

　　Mme. de Beauseant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own thoughts. For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word.

　　"The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured," said the Vicomtesse at last. "No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and sarcasms already! Ah! I will defend myself!"

　　She raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes.

　　"Ah!" she said, as she saw Eugene, "are you there?"

　　"Still," he said piteously.

　　"Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. You are determined to succeed? I will help you. You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man's pitiful vanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in the book of life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more cold-blooded your calculations, the further you will go. Strike ruthlessly; you will be feared. Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses; take a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop by the roadside; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition. You will be nothing here, you see, unless a woman interests herself in you; and she must be young and wealthy, and a woman of the world. Yet, if you have a heart, lock it carefully away like a treasure; do not let any one suspect it, or you will be lost; you would cease to be the executioner, you would take the victim's place. And if ever you should love, never let your secret escape you! Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart. Learn to mistrust every one; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet. Listen, Miguel"-- the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake--"there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a rivalry between two sisters. Restaud comes of a good family, his wife has been received into their circle; she has been presented at court; and her sister, her wealthy sister, Mme. Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a great capitalist, is consumed with envy, and ready to die of spleen. There is gulf set between the sisters--indeed, they are sisters no longer--the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other. So Mme. de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon. She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay; she has made herself de Marsay's slave, and she bores him. De Marsay cares very little about her. If you will introduce her to me, you will be her darling, her Benjamin; she will idolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do so; if not, make her useful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. I will bow to her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient. You have shut the Comtesse de Restaud's door against you by mentioning Father Goriot's name. Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house twenty times, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. Very well, then, now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her sister's house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give the signal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will begin to lose their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him; like the city madams, poor things, who copy our millinery, and hope thereby to acquire our manners. You will have a success, and in Paris success is everything; it is the key of power. If the women credit you with wit and talent, the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire to; you will go everywhere, and you will find out what the world is--an assemblage of fools and knaves. But you must be neither the one nor the other. I am giving you my name like Ariadne's clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it," she said, with a queenly glance and curve of her throat; "give it back to me unsullied. And now, go; leave me. We women also have our battles to fight."

　　"And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you----"

　　"Well?" she asked.

　　He tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin's smile, and went.

　　It was five o'clock, and Eugene was hungry; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him. A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage; he shakes his fist at society, and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words, "You have shut the Countess' door against you."

　　"I shall call!" he said to himself, "and if Mme. de Beauseant is right, if I never find her at home--I . . . well, Mme. de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice, and kill that Maxime of hers!"

　　"And money?" cried an inward monitor. "How about money, where is that to come from?" And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restaud's drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which Goriot's daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious splendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous extravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Beauseant. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart; his ideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the world as it is; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion, and found in success the ultima ratio mundi.

　　"Vautrin is right, success is virtue!" he said to himself.

　　Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and went in to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls, and the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden, and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds. On the one hand, he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair, impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art; and, on the other hand, he saw a sombre picture, the miry verge beyond these faces, in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de Beauseant's counsels, the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came to his mind, and poverty was a ready expositor. Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure success; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child! Those two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet.

　　"You are very dull, my lord Marquis," said Vautrin, with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind.

　　"I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me 'my lord Marquis,' " answered Eugene. "A marquis here in Paris, if he is not the veriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune's favorite."

　　Vautrin's glance at Rastignac was half-paternal, half- contemptuous. "Puppy!" it seemed to say; "I should make one mouthful of him!" Then he answered:

　　"You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a success."

　　"She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table," cried Rastignac.

　　Glances were exchanged all round the room; Father Goriot looked down.

　　"You have sent some snuff into my eye," he said to his neighbor, turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face.

　　"Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me," said Eugene, looking at the old man's neighbor; "he is worth all the rest of us put together.--I am not speaking of the ladies," he added, turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.

　　Eugene's remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the dinner-table. Vautrin alone spoke. "If you are going to champion Father Goriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain, you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils," he said, banteringly.

　　"So I intend," said Eugene.

　　"Then you are taking the field today?"

　　"Perhaps," Rastignac answered. "But I owe no account of myself to any one, especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night."

　　Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac.

　　"If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go behind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the curtain. That is enough," he added, seeing that Eugene was about to fly into a passion. "We can have a little talk whenever you like."

　　There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Goriot was so deeply dejected by the student's remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.

　　"Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess," said Mme. Vauquer in a low voice.

　　"And of a baroness," answered Rastignac.

　　"That is about all he is capable of," said Bianchon to Rastignac; "I have taken a look at his head; there is only one bump--the bump of Paternity; he must be an ETERNAL FATHER."

　　Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon's joke. He determined to profit by Mme. de Beauseant's counsels, and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay before him, nothing was his. Dinner came to an end, the others went, and he was left in the dining-room.

　　"So you have seen my daughter?" Goriot spoke tremulously, and the sound of his voice broke in upon Eugene's dreams. The young man took the elder's hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes.

　　"You are a good and noble man," he said. "We will have some talk about your daughters by and by."

　　He rose without waiting for Goriot's answer, and went to his room. There he wrote the following letter to his mother:--

　　"My Dear Mother,--Can you nourish your child from your breast again? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want twelve hundred francs--I must have them at all costs. Say nothing about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see the Vicomtesse de Beauseant; she is using her influence for me; I am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity. Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to sell our aunt's lace, tell her that I will send her some still handsomer," and so forth.

　　He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings--would they despoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures.

　　Yet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and he trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters, and how happy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris. Visions rose before his eyes; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little store, devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him incognito, essaying, for the first time in their lives, a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness.

　　"A sister's heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness!" he said to himself. He felt ashamed of those letters.

　　What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts; how pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer! What exquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice! What a pang for his mother's heart if she could not send him all that he asked for! And this noble affection, these sacrifices made at such terrible cost, were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen. A few tears, like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth, fell from his eyes. He walked up and down, and despair mingled with his emotion. Father Goriot saw him through the half-open door.

　　"What is the matter, sir?" he asked from the threshold.

　　"Ah! my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a father. You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one M. Maxime de Trailles, who will be her ruin."

　　Father Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugene failed to catch their meaning.

　　The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the last moment he wavered and doubted, but he ended by flinging them into the box. "I shall succeed!" he said to himself. So says the gambler; so says the great captain; but the three words that have been the salvation of some few, have been the ruin of many more.

　　A few days after this Eugene called at Mme. de Restaud's house; she was not at home. Three times he tried the experiment, and three times he found her doors closed against him, though he was careful to choose an hour when M. de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.

　　The student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name, and after thus attesting his presence, departed forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up for his examinations; he made up his mind to cram his second and third years' work into the third year, when he meant to begin to work in earnest, and to complete his studies in law with one great effort. In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris, to spread the nets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a fortune. Twice during that week he saw Mme. de Beauseant; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis d'Ajuda drive away.

　　Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most poetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and the marriage of the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed. The dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before, but the end was only so much the nearer. The Marquis d'Ajuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very fortunate thing; Mme. de Beauseant (so they hoped) would gradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the end would be brought to sacrifice d'Ajuda's morning visits to the exigencies of a man's career, exigencies which she must have foreseen. In spite of the most solemn promises, daily renewed, M. d'Ajuda was playing a part, and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived. "Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window, she is falling headlong down the staircase," said her most intimate friend, the Duchesse de Langeais. Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin. She had a half-superstitious affection for him. Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity, no real comfort in any eyes; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries, it is because he has an interested motive.

　　Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot's previous history; he would come to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may be given briefly as follows:--

　　In the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a vermicelli maker. He was a skilful, thrifty workman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master's business when the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789. Goriot established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne, close to the Corn Exchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President of the Section, so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch. This prudent step had led to success; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity (real or artificial), when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris. People used to fight for bread at the bakers' doors; while other persons went to the grocers' shops and bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it. It was during this year that Goriot made the money, which, at a later time, was to give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer; he had, moreover, the usual luck of average ability; his mediocrity was the salvation of him. He excited no one's envy, it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over, and all his intelligence was concentrated, not on political, but on commercial speculations. Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions relating to corn, flour, and "middlings"; and the production, storage, and quality of grain. He could estimate the yield of the harvest, and foresee market prices; he bought his cereals in Sicily, and imported Russian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain, who had seen his grasp of the subject, his clear insight into the principles involved, his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked, would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made. Patient, active, and persevering, energetic and prompt in action, he surveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye. Nothing there took him by surprise; he foresaw all things, knew all that was happening, and kept his own counsel; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the march. But beyond this business horizon he could not see. He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop, leaning against the framework of the door. Take him from his dark little counting-house, and he became once more the rough, slow-witted workman, a man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning, who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at the play, a Parisian Dolibom in short, against whose stupidity other minds are powerless.

　　Natures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of sublime affection. Two all- absorbing affections filled the vermicelli maker's heart to the exclusion of every other feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature, as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. He had regarded his wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie, with a devout admiration; his love for her had been boundless. Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature, which, in its delicate strength, was the very opposite of his own. Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection, a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature? Join love thereto, the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures, and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature.

　　After seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. It was very unfortunate for him. She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways; possibly she might have brought that barren soil under cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts. But when she was dead, the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the affection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he found full satisfaction for his heart in loving them. More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time; wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again; but he determined to remain a widower. His father-in-law, the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship, gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife's memory. The frequenters of the Corn Exchange, who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly, joked about it among themselves, and found a ridiculous nickname for him. One of them ventured (after a glass over a bargain) to call him by it, and a blow from the vermicelli maker's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin. He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious; and this was so well known, that one day a competitor, who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself, told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab. The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale, left the Exchange at once, and did not return for several days afterwards; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm. This time, however, the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder; at a critical moment in the man's affairs, Goriot drove him into bankruptcy, and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.

　　As might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. With an income of sixty thousand francs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself, and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls. The best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education. They had a chaperon--luckily for them, she was a woman who had good sense and good taste;--they learned to ride; they had a carriage for their use; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live; they had only to express a wish, their father would hasten to give them their most extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss. Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels; and, quite naturally, he himself was left beneath them. Poor man! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him.

　　When the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to choose for themselves. Each had half her father's fortune as her dowry; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty, her social aspirations led her to leave her father's house for a more exalted sphere. Delphine wished for money; she married Nucingen, a banker of German extraction, who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire. Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before. His daughters and his sons-in-law began to demur; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade, though his whole life was bound up with his business. For five years he stood out against their entreaties, then he yielded, and consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years. It was this capital that Mme. Vauquer, in the early days of his residence with her, had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year. He had taken refuge in her lodging- house, driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their houses, but even to see him no more except in private.

　　This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who had purchased Goriot's business, information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais' suppositions, and herewith the preliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end.

　　Towards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two letters--one from his mother, and one from his eldest sister. His heart beat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight of the familiar handwriting. Those two little scraps of paper contained life or death for his hopes. But while he felt a shiver of dread as he remembered their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so well that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very life-blood. His mother's letter ran as follows:--

　　"My Dear Child,--I am sending you the money that you asked for. Make a good use of it. Even to save your life I could not raise so large a sum a second time without your father's knowledge, and there would be trouble about it. We should be obliged to mortgage the land. It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that you should fear to tell me about them? Volumes of explanation would not have been needed; we mothers can understand at a word, and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. I do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter has made upon me, my dear son. What can you have felt when you were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? It must have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so much pain as I read it. To what courses are you committed? You are going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole life and success depends upon this? You are about to see a society into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that you cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for your studies. Ah! my dear Eugene, believe your mother, crooked ways cannot lead to great ends. Patience and endurance are the two qualities most needed in your position. I am not scolding you; I do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering. I am only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her foresight for you. You know the steps that you must take, and I, for my part, know the purity of heart, and how good your intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt, 'Go forward, beloved!' If I tremble, it is because I am a mother, but my prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. Be very careful, dear boy. You must have a man's prudence, for it lies with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to you, and must look to you. Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and your success is ours. We all pray to God to be with you in all that you do. Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to your gloves. 'But I have a weakness for the eldest!' she said gaily. You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugene. I shall wait till you have succeeded before telling you all that she has done for you, or her money would burn your fingers. You, who are young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a piece of your past! But what would we not sacrifice for your sakes? Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the forehead from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she says. She would have written you herself, the dear kind-hearted woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now. Your father is very well. The vintage of 1819 has turned out better than we expected. Good-bye, dear boy; I will say nothing about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must let her have the pleasure of giving you all the home news. Heaven send that you may succeed! Oh! yes, dear Eugene, you must succeed. I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I do not think I could endure it a second time. I have come to know what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my children's sake. There, good-bye! Do not leave us for long without news of you; and here, at the last, take a kiss from your mother."

　　By the time Eugene had finished the letter he was in tears. He thought of Father Goriot crushing his silver keepsake into a shapeless mass before he sold it to meet his daughter's bill of exchange.

　　"Your mother has broken up her jewels for you," he said to himself; "your aunt shed tears over those relics of hers before she sold them for your sake. What right have you to heap execrations on Anastasie? You have followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to your own future, and she sacrifices her father to her lover; and of you two, which is the worse?"

　　He was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take that money. The fires of remorse burned in his heart, and gave him intolerable pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take into account when they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but perhaps the angels in heaven, beholding it, pardon the criminal whom our justice condemns. Rastignac opened his sister's letter; its simplicity and kindness revived his heart.

　　"Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. Agathe and I had thought of so many different ways of spending our money, that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have come in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged to the King of Spain, you have restored harmony; for, really and truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted most, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear Eugene, of a way of spending our money which would satisfy us completely. Agathe jumped for you. Indeed, we have been like two mad things all day, 'to such a prodigious degree' (as aunt would say), that mother said, with her severe expression, 'Whatever can be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?' I think if we had been scolded a little, we should have been still better pleased. A woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she loves! I, however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of all my joy. I shall make a bad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of spending. I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for piercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not want, so that I have less than that slow-coach Agathe, who is so economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. She had two hundred francs! And I have only one hundred and fifty! I am nicely punished; I could throw my sash down the well; it will be painful to me to wear it now. Poor dear, I have robbed you. And Agathe was so nice about it. She said, 'Let us send the three hundred and fifty francs in our two names!' But I could not help telling you everything just as it happened.

　　"Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? We took our glittering hoard, we went out for a walk, and when once fairly on the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we handed over the coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Messageries Royales. We came back again like swallows on the wing. 'Don't you think that happiness has made us lighter?' Agathe said. We said all sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien, because they were all about you. Oh, we love you dearly, dear brother; it was all summed up in those few words. As for keeping the secret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything (according to our aunt), even of holding our tongues. Our mother has been on a mysterious journey to Angouleme, and the aunt went with her, not without solemn councils, from which we were shut out, and M. le Baron likewise. They are silent as to the weighty political considerations that prompted their mission, and conjectures are rife in the State of Rastignac. The Infantas are embroidering a muslin robe with open- work sprigs for her Majesty the Queen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. There be but two more breadths to finish. A decree has gone forth that no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge shall be planted instead thereof. Our subjects may sustain some disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but strangers will enjoy a fair prospect. Should the heir-presumptive lack pocket-handkerchiefs, be it known unto him that the dowager Lady of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her drawers and boxes (known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to light a fair piece of cambric whereof she wotted not, the Princesses Agathe and Laure place at their brother's disposal their thread, their needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. The two young Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel, retain their fatal habits of stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of taking their pleasure by going a-bird-nesting, and of cutting switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the laws of the realm. Moreover, they list not to learn naught, wherefore the Papal Nuncio (called of the commonalty, M. le Cure) threateneth them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred canons of grammatical construction for the construction of other canon, deadly engines made of the stems of elder.

　　"Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for your success, so much love fully satisfied. You will have a great deal to tell us when you come home! You will tell me everything, won't you? I am the oldest. From something the aunt let fall, we think you must have had some success.

　　"Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said . . .

　　"Of course not, in our family! Oh, by-the-by, Eugene, would you rather that we made that piece of cambric into shirts for you instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? If you want some really nice shirts at once, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them; and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send us one for a pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. Good- bye! Good-bye! Take my kiss on the left side of your forehead, on the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the world. I am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has solemnly promised not to read a word that I have written; but, all the same, I mean to sit by her side while she writes, so as to be quite sure that she keeps her word.--Your loving sister, "Laure de Rastignac."

　　"Yes!" said Eugene to himself. "Yes! Success at all costs now! Riches could not repay such devotion as this. I wish I could give them every sort of happiness! Fifteen hundred and fifty francs," he went on after a pause. "Every shot must go to the mark! Laure is right. Trust a woman! I have only calico shirts. Where some one else's welfare is concerned, a young girl becomes as ingenious as a thief. Guileless where she herself is in question, and full of foresight for me,--she is like a heavenly angel forgiving the strange incomprehensible sins of earth."

　　The world lay before him. His tailor had been summoned and sounded, and had finally surrendered. When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had seen at once how great a part the tailor plays in a young man's career; a tailor is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an invoice for a bond of friendship; between these two extremes there is, alack! no middle term. In this representative of his craft Eugene discovered a man who understood that his was a sort of paternal function for young men at their entrance into life, who regarded himself as a stepping- stone between a young man's present and future. And Rastignac in gratitude made the man's fortune by an epigram of a kind in which he excelled at a later period of his life.

　　"I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match of twenty thousand livres a year!"

　　Fifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to order! At that moment the poor child of the South felt no more doubts of any kind. The young man went down to breakfast with the indefinable air which the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth. No sooner are the coins slipped into a student's pocket than his wealth, in imagination at least, is piled into a fantastic column, which affords him a moral support. He begins to hold up his head as he walks; he is conscious that he has a means of bringing his powers to bear on a given point; he looks you straight in the face; his gestures are quick and decided; only yesterday he was diffident and shy, any one might have pushed him aside; to-morrow, he will take the wall of a prime minister. A miracle has been wrought in him. Nothing is beyond the reach of his ambition, and his ambition soars at random; he is light-hearted, generous, and enthusiastic; in short, the fledgling bird has discovered that he has wings. A poor student snatches at every chance pleasure much as a dog runs all sorts of risks to steal a bone, cracking it and sucking the marrow as he flies from pursuit; but a young man who can rattle a few runaway gold coins in his pocket can take his pleasure deliberately, can taste the whole of the sweets of secure possession; he soars far above earth; he has forgotten what the word POVERTY means; all Paris is his. Those are days when the whole world shines radiant with light, when everything glows and sparkles before the eyes of youth, days that bring joyous energy that is never brought into harness, days of debts and of painful fears that go hand in hand with every delight. Those who do not know the left bank of the Seine between the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Peres know nothing of life.

　　"Ah! if the women of Paris but knew," said Rastignac, as he devoured Mme. Vauquer's stewed pears (at five for a penny), "they would come here in search of a lover."

　　Just then a porter from the Messageries Royales appeared at the door of the room; they had previously heard the bell ring as the wicket opened to admit him. The man asked for M. Eugene de Rastignac, holding out two bags for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature. Vautrin's keen glance cut Eugene like a lash.

　　"Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the shooting gallery," he said.

　　"Your ship has come in," said Mme. Vauquer, eyeing the bags.

　　Mlle. Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes should betray her cupidity.

　　"You have a kind mother," said Mme. Couture.

　　"You have a kind mother, sir," echoed Poiret.

　　"Yes, mamma has been drained dry," said Vautrin, "and now you can have your fling, go into society, and fish for heiresses, and dance with countesses who have peach blossom in their hair. But take my advice, young man, and don't neglect your pistol practice."

　　Vautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist. Rastignac, meaning to give the porter a tip, felt in his pockets and found nothing. Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table.

　　"Your credit is good," he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac was forced to thank him, though, since the sharp encounter of wits at dinner that day, after Eugene came in from calling on Mme. de Beauseant, he had made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. For a week, in fact, they had both kept silence in each other's presence, and watched each other. The student tried in vain to account to himself for this attitude.

　　An idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it is expressed; it strikes where the brain sends it, by a law as mathematically exact as the law that determines the course of a shell from a mortar. The amount of impression it makes is not to be determined so exactly. Sometimes, in an impressible nature, the idea works havoc, but there are, no less, natures so robustly protected, that this sort of projectile falls flat and harmless on skulls of triple brass, as cannon-shot against solid masonry; then there are flaccid and spongy-fibred natures into which ideas from without sink like spent bullets into the earthworks of a redoubt. Rastignac's head was something of the powder-magazine order; the least shock sufficed to bring about an explosion. He was too quick, too young, not to be readily accessible to ideas; and open to that subtle influence of thought and feeling in others which causes so many strange phenomena that make an impression upon us of which we are all unconscious at the time. Nothing escaped his mental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the mental powers of perception, which seem like duplicates of the senses, had the mysterious power of swift projection that astonishes us in intellects of a high order--slingers who are quick to detect the weak spot in any armor.

　　In the past month Eugene's good qualities and defects had rapidly developed with his character. Intercourse with the world and the endeavor to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects. But Rastignac came from the South side of the Loire, and had the good qualities of his countrymen. He had the impetuous courage of the South, that rushes to the attack of a difficulty, as well as the southern impatience of delay or suspense. These traits are held to be defects in the North; they made the fortune of Murat, but they likewise cut short his career. The moral would appear to be that when the dash and boldness of the South side of the Loire meets, in a southern temperament, with the guile of the North, the character is complete, and such a man will gain (and keep) the crown of Sweden.

　　Rastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin's batteries for long without discovering whether this was a friend or a foe. He felt as if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and dissecting his feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and secretive that he seemed to have something of the profound and unmoved serenity of a sphinx, seeing and hearing all things and saying nothing. Eugene, conscious of that money in his pocket, grew rebellious.

　　"Be so good as to wait a moment," he said to Vautrin, as the latter rose, after slowly emptying his coffee-cup, sip by sip.

　　"What for?" inquired the older man, as he put on his large- brimmed hat and took up the sword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man who will face three or four footpads without flinching.

　　"I will repay you in a minute," returned Eugene. He unsealed one of the bags as he spoke, counted out a hundred and forty francs, and pushed them towards Mme. Vauquer. "Short reckonings make good friends" he added, turning to the widow; "that clears our accounts till the end of the year. Can you give me change for a five-franc piece?"

　　"Good friends make short reckonings," echoed Poiret, with a glance at Vautrin.

　　"Here is your franc," said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the sphinx in the black wig.

　　"Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle," exclaimed this latter, with a searching glance that seemed to read the young man's inmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical smile on Vautrin's face such as Eugene had seen scores of times already; every time he saw it, it exasperated him almost beyond endurance.

　　"Well . . . so I am," he answered. He held both the bags in his hand, and had risen to go up to his room.

　　Vautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the student turned to go through the second door that opened into the square lobby at the foot of the staircase.

　　"Do you know, Monsieur le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you were saying just now was not exactly polite?" Vautrin remarked, as he rattled his sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room door, and came up to the student.

　　Rastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the staircase, and shut the dining-room door. They were standing in the little square lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room; the place was lighted by an iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access into the garden. Sylvie came out of her kitchen, and Eugene chose that moment to say:

　　MONSIEUR Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not Rastignacorama."

　　"They will fight," said Mlle. Michonneau, in an indifferent tone.

　　"Fight!" echoed Poiret.

　　"Not they," replied Mme. Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of coins.

　　"But there they are under the lime-trees," cried Mlle. Victorine, who had risen so that she might see out into the garden. "Poor young man! he was in the right, after all."

　　"We must go upstairs, my pet," said Mme. Couture; "it is no business of ours."

　　At the door, however, Mme. Couture and Victorine found their progress barred by the portly form of Sylvie the cook.

　　"What ever can have happened?" she said. "M. Vautrin said to M. Eugene, 'Let us have an explanation!' then he took him by the arm, and there they are, out among the artichokes."

　　Vautrin came in while she was speaking. "Mamma Vauquer," he said smiling, "don't frighten yourself at all. I am only going to try my pistols under the lime-trees."

　　"Oh! monsieur," cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, "why do you want to kill M. Eugene?"

　　Vautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine.

　　"Oh! this is something fresh!" he exclaimed in a bantering tone, that brought the color into the poor girl's face. "That young fellow yonder is very nice, isn't he?" he went on. "You have given me a notion, my pretty child; I will make you both happy."

　　Mme. Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl away, as she said in her ear:

　　"Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this morning."

　　"I don't want any shots fired in my garden," said Mme. Vauquer. "You will frighten the neighborhood and bring the police up here all in a moment."

　　"Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer," answered Vautrin. "There, there; it's all right; we will go to the shooting-gallery."

　　He went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young man's arm.

　　"When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put a bullet through the ace on a card five times running at thirty-five paces," he said, "that won't take away your appetite, I suppose? You look to me to be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and as if you would rush on your death like a blockhead."

　　"Do you draw back?" asked Eugene.

　　"Don't try to raise my temperature," answered Vautrin, "it is not cold this morning. Let us go and sit over there," he added, pointing to the green-painted garden seats; "no one can overhear us. I want a little talk with you. You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no quarrel with you. I like you, take Trump--(confound it!)--take Vautrin's word for it. What makes me like you? I will tell you by-and-by. Meantime, I can tell you that I know you as well as if I had made you myself, as I will prove to you in a minute. Put down your bags," he continued, pointing to the round table.

　　Rastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. He was consumed with curiosity, which the sudden change in the manner of the man before him had excited to the highest pitch. Here was a strange being who, a moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as his protector.

　　"You would like to know who I really am, what I was, and what I do now," Vautrin went on. "You want to know too much, youngster. Come! come! keep cool! You will hear more astonishing things than that. I have had my misfortunes. Just hear me out first, and you shall have your turn afterwards. Here is my past in three words. Who am I? Vautrin. What do I do? Just what I please. Let us change the subject. You want to know my character. I am good- natured to those who do me a good turn, or to those whose hearts speak to mine. These last may do anything they like with me; they may bruise my shins, and I shall not tell them to 'mind what they are about'; but, nom d'une pipe, the devil himself is not an uglier customer than I can be if people annoy me, or if I don't happen to take to them; and you may just as well know at once that I think no more of killing a man than of that," and he spat before him as he spoke. "Only when it is absolutely necessary to do so, I do my best to kill him properly. I am what you call an artist. I have read Benvenuto Cellini's Memoirs, such as you see me; and, what is more, in Italian: A fine-spirited fellow he was! From him I learned to follow the example set us by Providence, who strikes us down at random, and to admire the beautiful whenever and wherever it is found. And, setting other questions aside, is it not a glorious part to play, when you pit yourself against mankind, and the luck is on your side? I have thought a good deal about the constitution of your present social Dis- order. A duel is downright childish, my boy! utter nonsense and folly! When one of two living men must be got out of the way, none but an idiot would leave chance to decide which it is to be; and in a duel it is a toss-up--heads or tails--and there you are! Now I, for instance, can hit the ace in the middle of a card five times running, send one bullet after another through the same hole, and at thirty-five paces, moreover! With that little accomplishment you might think yourself certain of killing your man, mightn't you. Well, I have fired, at twenty paces, and missed, and the rogue who had never handled a pistol in his life-- look here!"--(he unbuttoned his waistcoat and exposed his chest, covered, like a bear's back, with a shaggy fell; the student gave a startled shudder)--"he was a raw lad, but he made his mark on me," the extraordinary man went on, drawing Rastignac's fingers over a deep scar on his breast. But that happened when I myself was a mere boy; I was one-and-twenty then (your age), and I had some beliefs left--in a woman's love, and in a pack of rubbish that you will be over head and ears in directly. You and I were to have fought just now, weren't we? You might have killed me. Suppose that I were put under the earth, where would you be? You would have to clear out of this, go to Switzerland, draw on papa's purse--and he has none too much in it as it is. I mean to open your eyes to your real position, that is what I am going to do: but I shall do it from the point of view of a man who, after studying the world very closely, sees that there are but two alternatives--stupid obedience or revolt. I obey nobody; is that clear? Now, do you know how much you will want at the pace you are going? A million; and promptly, too, or that little head of ours will be swaying to and fro in the drag-nets at Saint-Cloud, while we are gone to find out whether or no there is a Supreme Being. I will put you in the way of that million."

　　He stopped for a moment and looked at Eugene.

　　"Aha! you do not look so sourly at papa Vautrin now! At the mention of the million you look like a young girl when somebody has said, 'I will come for you this evening!' and she betakes herself to her toilette as a cat licks its whiskers over a saucer of milk. All right. Come, now, let us go into the question, young man; all between ourselves, you know. We have a papa and mamma down yonder, a great-aunt, two sisters (aged eighteen and seventeen), two young brothers (one fifteen, and the other ten), that is about the roll-call of the crew. The aunt brings up the two sisters; the cure comes and teaches the boys Latin. Boiled chestnuts are oftener on the table than white bread. Papa makes a suit of clothes last a long while; if mamma has a different dress winter and summer, it is about as much as she has; the sisters manage as best they can. I know all about it; I have lived in the south.

　　"That is how things are at home. They send you twelve hundred francs a year, and the whole property only brings in three thousand francs all told. We have a cook and a manservant; papa is a baron, and we must keep up appearances. Then we have our ambitions; we are connected with the Beauseants, and we go afoot through the streets; we want to be rich, and we have not a penny; we eat Mme. Vauquer's messes, and we like grand dinners in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; we sleep on a truckle-bed, and dream of a mansion! I do not blame you for wanting these things. What sort of men do the women run after? Men of ambition. Men of ambition have stronger frames, their blood is richer in iron, their hearts are warmer than those of ordinary men. Women feel that when their power is greatest, they look their best, and that those are their happiest hours; they like power in men, and prefer the strongest even if it is a power that may be their own destruction. I am going to make an inventory of your desires in order to put the question at issue before you. Here it is:--

　　"We are as hungry as a wolf, and those newly-cut teeth of ours are sharp; what are we to do to keep the pot boiling? In the first place, we have the Code to browse upon; it is not amusing, and we are none the wiser for it, but that cannot be helped. So far so good. We mean to make an advocate of ourselves with a prospect of one day being made President of a Court of Assize, when we shall send poor devils, our betters, to the galleys with a T.F.* [*Travaux forces.] on their shoulders, so that the rich may be convinced that they can sleep in peace. There is no fun in that; and you are a long while coming to it; for, to begin with, there are two years of nauseous drudgery in Paris, we see all the lollipops that we long for out of our reach. It is tiresome to want things and never to have them. If you were a pallid creature of the mollusk order, you would have nothing to fear, but it is different when you have the hot blood of a lion and are ready to get into a score of scrapes every day of your life. This is the ghastliest form of torture known in this inferno of God's making, and you will give in to it. Or suppose that you are a good boy, drink nothing stronger than milk, and bemoan your hard lot; you, with your generous nature, will endure hardships that would drive a dog mad, and make a start, after long waiting, as deputy to some rascal or other in a hole of a place where the Government will fling you a thousand francs a year like the scraps that are thrown to the butcher's dog. Bark at thieves, plead the cause of the rich, send men of heart to the guillotine, that is your work! Many thanks! If you have no influence, you may rot in your provincial tribunal. At thirty you will be a Justice with twelve hundred francs a year (if you have not flung off the gown for good before then). By the time you are forty you may look to marry a miller's daughter, an heiress with some six thousand livres a year. Much obliged! If you have influence, you may possibly be a Public Prosecutor by the time you are thirty; with a salary of a thousand crowns, you could look to marry the mayor's daughter. Some petty piece of political trickery, such as mistaking Villele for Manuel in a bulletin (the names rhyme, and that quiets your conscience), and you will probably be a Procureur General by the time you are forty, with a chance of becoming a deputy. Please to observe, my dear boy, that our conscience will have been a little damaged in the process, and that we shall endure twenty years of drudgery and hidden poverty, and that our sisters are wearing Dian's livery. I have the honor to call your attention to another fact: to wit, that there are but twenty Procureurs Generaux at a time in all France, while there are some twenty thousand of you young men who aspire to that elevated position; that there are some mountebanks among you who would sell their family to screw their fortunes a peg higher. If this sort of thing sickens you, try another course. The Baron de Rastignac thinks of becoming an advocate, does he? There's a nice prospect for you! Ten years of drudgery straight away. You are obliged to live at the rate of a thousand francs a month; you must have a library of law books, live in chambers, go into society, go down on your knees to ask a solicitor for briefs, lick the dust off the floor of the Palais de Justice. If this kind of business led to anything, I should not say no; but just give me the names of five advocates here in Paris who by the time that they are fifty are making fifty thousand francs a year! Bah! I would sooner turn pirate on the high seas than have my soul shrivel up inside me like that. How will you find the capital? There is but one way, marry a woman who has money. There is no fun in it. Have you a mind to marry? You hang a stone around your neck; for if you marry for money, what becomes of our exalted notions of honor and so forth? You might as well fly in the face of social conventions at once. Is it nothing to crawl like a serpent before your wife, to lick her mother's feet, to descend to dirty actions that would sicken swine--faugh!--never mind if you at least make your fortune. But you will be as doleful as a dripstone if you marry for money. It is better to wrestle with men than to wrangle at home with your wife. You are at the crossway of the roads of life, my boy; choose your way.

　　"But you have chosen already. You have gone to see your cousin of Beauseant, and you have had an inkling of luxury; you have been to Mme. de Restaud's house, and in Father Goriot's daughter you have seen a glimpse of the Parisienne for the first time. That day you came back with a word written on your forehead. I knew it, I could read it--'SUCCESS!' Yes, success at any price. 'Bravo,' said I to myself, 'here is the sort of fellow for me.' You wanted money. Where was it all to come from? You have drained your sisters' little hoard (all brothers sponge more or less on their sisters). Those fifteen hundred francs of yours (got together, God knows how! in a country where there are more chestnuts than five-franc pieces) will slip away like soldiers after pillage. And, then, what will you do? Shall you begin to work? Work, or what you understand by work at this moment, means, for a man of Poiret's calibre, an old age in Mamma Vauquer's lodging-house. There are fifty thousand young men in your position at this moment, all bent as you are on solving one and the same problem--how to acquire a fortune rapidly. You are but a unit in that aggregate. You can guess, therefore, what efforts you must make, how desperate the struggle is. There are not fifty thousand good positions for you; you must fight and devour one another like spiders in a pot. Do you know how a man makes his way here? By brilliant genius or by skilful corruption. You must either cut your way through these masses of men like a cannon ball, or steal among them like a plague. Honesty is nothing to the purpose. Men bow before the power of genius; they hate it, and try to slander it, because genius does not divide the spoil; but if genius persists, they bow before it. To sum it all up in a phrase, if they fail to smother genius in the mud, they fall on their knees and worship it. Corruption is a great power in the world, and talent is scarce. So corruption is the weapon of superfluous mediocrity; you will be made to feel the point of it everywhere. You will see women who spend more than ten thousand francs a year on dress, while their husband's salary (his whole income) is six thousand francs. You will see officials buying estates on twelve thousand francs a year. You will see women who sell themselves body and soul to drive in a carriage belonging to the son of a peer of France, who has a right to drive in the middle rank at Longchamp. You have seen that poor simpleton of a Goriot obliged to meet a bill with his daughter's name at the back of it, though her husband has fifty thousand francs a year. I defy you to walk a couple of yards anywhere in Paris without stumbling on some infernal complication. I'll bet my head to a head of that salad that you will stir up a hornet's nest by taking a fancy to the first young, rich, and pretty woman you meet. They are all dodging the law, all at loggerheads with their husbands. If I were to begin to tell you all that vanity or necessity (virtue is not often mixed up in it, you may be sure), all that vanity and necessity drive them to do for lovers, finery, housekeeping, or children, I should never come to an end. So an honest man is the common enemy.

　　"But do you know what an honest man is? Here, in Paris, an honest man is the man who keeps his own counsel, and will not divide the plunder. I am not speaking now of those poor bond-slaves who do the work of the world without a reward for their toil--God Almighty's outcasts, I call them. Among them, I grant you, is virtue in all the flower of its stupidity, but poverty is no less their portion. At this moment, I think I see the long faces those good folk would pull if God played a practical joke on them and stayed away at the Last Judgment.

　　"Well, then, if you mean to make a fortune quickly, you must either be rich to begin with, or make people believe that you are rich. It is no use playing here except for high stakes; once take to low play, it is all up with you. If in the scores of professions that are open to you, there are ten men who rise very rapidly, people are sure to call them thieves. You can draw your own conclusions. Such is life. It is no cleaner than a kitchen; it reeks like a kitchen; and if you mean to cook your dinner, you must expect to soil your hands; the real art is in getting them clean again, and therein lies the whole morality of our epoch. If I take this tone in speaking of the world to you, I have the right to do so; I know it well. Do you think that I am blaming it? Far from it; the world has always been as it is now. Moralists' strictures will never change it. Mankind are not perfect, but one age is more or less hypocritical than another, and then simpletons say that its morality is high or low. I do not think that the rich are any worse than the poor; man is much the same, high or low, or wherever he is. In a million of these human cattle there may be half a score of bold spirits who rise above the rest, above the laws; I am one of them. And you, if you are cleverer than your fellows, make straight to your end, and hold your head high. But you must lay your account with envy and slander and mediocrity, and every man's hand will be against you. Napoleon met with a Minister of War, Aubry by name, who all but sent him to the colonies.

　　"Feel your pulse. Think whether you can get up morning after morning, strengthened in yesterday's purpose. In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline. Listen attentively. You see, I have an idea of my own. My idea is to live a patriarchal life on a vast estate, say a hundred thousand acres, somewhere in the Southern States of America. I mean to be a planter, to have slaves, to make a few snug millions by selling my cattle, timber, and tobacco; I want to live an absolute monarch, and to do just as I please; to lead such a life as no one here in these squalid dens of lath and plaster ever imagines. I am a great poet; I do not write my poems, I feel them, and act them. At this moment I have fifty thousand francs, which might possibly buy forty negroes. I want two hundred thousand francs, because I want to have two hundred negroes to carry out my notions of the patriarachal life properly. Negroes, you see, are like a sort of family ready grown, and there are no inquisitive public prosecutors out there to interfere with you. That investment in ebony ought to mean three or four million francs in ten years' time. If I am successful, no one will ask me who I am. I shall be Mr. Four Millions, an American citizen. I shall be fifty years old by then, and sound and hearty still; I shall enjoy life after my own fashion. In two words, if I find you an heiress with a million, will you give me two hundred thousand francs? Twenty per cent commission, eh? Is that too much? Your little wife will be very much in love with you. Once married, you will show signs of uneasiness and remorse; for a couple of weeks you will be depressed. Then, some night after sundry grimacings, comes the confession, between two kisses, 'Two hundred thousand francs of debts, my darling!' This sort of farce is played every day in Paris, and by young men of the highest fashion. When a young wife has given her heart, she will not refuse her purse. Perhaps you are thinking that you will lose the money for good? Not you. You will make two hundred thousand francs again by some stroke of business. With your capital and your brains you should be able to accumulate as large a fortune as you could wish. ERGO, in six months you will have made your own fortune, and our old friend Vautrin's, and made an amiable woman very happy, to say nothing of your people at home, who must blow on their fingers to warm them, in the winter, for lack of firewood. You need not be surprised at my proposal, nor at the demand I make. Forty-seven out of every sixty great matches here in Paris are made after just such a bargain as this. The Chamber of Notaries compels my gentleman to----"

　　"What must I do?" said Rastignac, eagerly interrupting Vautrin's speech.

　　"Next to nothing," returned the other, with a slight involuntary movement, the suppressed exultation of the angler when he feels a bite at the end of his line. "Follow me carefully! The heart of a girl whose life is wretched and unhappy is a sponge that will thirstily absorb love; a dry sponge that swells at the first drop of sentiment. If you pay court to a young girl whose existence is a compound of loneliness, despair, and poverty, and who has no suspicion that she will come into a fortune, good Lord! it is quint and quatorze at piquet; it is knowing the numbers of the lottery before-hand; it is speculating in the funds when you have news from a sure source; it is building up a marriage on an indestructible foundation. The girl may come in for millions, and she will fling them, as if they were so many pebbles, at your feet. 'Take it, my beloved! Take it, Alfred, Adolphe, Eugene!' or whoever it was that showed his sense by sacrificing himself for her. And as for sacrificing himself, this is how I understand it. You sell a coat that is getting shabby, so that you can take her to the Cadran bleu, treat her to mushrooms on toast, and then go to the Ambigu-Comique in the evening; you pawn your watch to buy her a shawl. I need not remind you of the fiddle-faddle sentimentality that goes down so well with all women; you spill a few drops of water on your stationery, for instance; those are the tears you shed while far away from her. You look to me as if you were perfectly acquainted with the argot of the heart. Paris, you see, is like a forest in the New World, where you have to deal with a score of varieties of savages--Illinois and Hurons, who live on the proceed of their social hunting. You are a hunter of millions; you set your snares; you use lures and nets; there are many ways of hunting. Some hunt heiresses, others a legacy; some fish for souls, yet others sell their clients, bound hand and foot. Every one who comes back from the chase with his game- bag well filled meets with a warm welcome in good society. In justice to this hospitable part of the world, it must be said that you have to do with the most easy and good-natured of great cities. If the proud aristocracies of the rest of Europe refuse admittance among their ranks to a disreputable millionaire, Paris stretches out a hand to him, goes to his banquets, eats his dinners, and hobnobs with his infamy."

　　"But where is such a girl to be found?" asked Eugene.

　　"Under your eyes; she is yours already."

　　"Mlle. Victorine?"

　　"Precisely."

　　"And what was that you said?"

　　"She is in love with you already, your little Baronne de Rastignac!"

　　"She has not a penny," Eugene continued, much mystified.

　　"Ah! now we are coming to it! Just another word or two, and it will all be clear enough. Her father, Taillefer, is an old scoundrel; it is said that he murdered one of his friends at the time of the Revolution. He is one of your comedians that sets up to have opinions of his own. He is a banker--senior partner in the house of Frederic Taillefer and Company. He has one son, and means to leave all he has to the boy, to the prejudice of Victorine. For my part, I don't like to see injustice of this sort. I am like Don Quixote, I have a fancy for defending the weak against the strong. If it should please God to take that youth away from him, Taillefer would have only his daughter left; he would want to leave his money to some one or other; an absurd notion, but it is only human nature, and he is not likely to have any more children, as I know. Victorine is gentle and amiable; she will soon twist her father round her fingers, and set his head spinning like a German top by plying him with sentiment! She will be too much touched by your devotion to forget you; you will marry her. I mean to play Providence for you, and Providence is to do my will. I have a friend whom I have attached closely to myself, a colonel in the Army of the Loire, who has just been transferred into the garde royale. He has taken my advice and turned ultra-royalist; he is not one of those fools who never change their opinions. Of all pieces of advice, my cherub, I would give you this--don't stick to your opinions any more than to your words. If any one asks you for them, let him have them-- at a price. A man who prides himself on going in a straight line through life is an idiot who believes in infallibility. There are no such things as principles; there are only events, and there are no laws but those of expediency: a man of talent accepts events and the circumstances in which he finds himself, and turns everything to his own ends. If laws and principles were fixed and invariable, nations would not change them as readily as we change our shirts. The individual is not obliged to be more particular than the nation. A man whose services to France have been of the very slightest is a fetich looked on with superstitious awe because he has always seen everything in red; but he is good, at the most, to be put into the Museum of Arts and Crafts, among the automatic machines, and labeled La Fayette; while the prince at whom everybody flings a stone, the man who despises humanity so much that he spits as many oaths as he is asked for in the face of humanity, saved France from being torn in pieces at the Congress of Vienna; and they who should have given him laurels fling mud at him. Oh! I know something of affairs, I can tell you; I have the secrets of many men! Enough. When I find three minds in agreement as to the application of a principle, I shall have a fixed and immovable opinion--I shall have to wait a long while first. In the Tribunals you will not find three judges of the same opinion on a single point of law. To return to the man I was telling you of. He would crucify Jesus Christ again, if I bade him. At a word from his old chum Vautrin he will pick a quarrel with a scamp that will not send so much as five francs to his sister, poor girl, and" (here Vautrin rose to his feet and stood like a fencing-master about to lunge)--"turn him off into the dark!" he added.

　　"How frightful!" said Eugene. "You do not really mean it? M. Vautrin, you are joking!"

　　"There! there! Keep cool!" said the other. "Don't behave like a baby. But if you find any amusement in it, be indignant, flare up! Say that I am a scoundrel, a rascal, a rogue, a bandit; but do not call me a blackleg nor a spy! There, out with it, fire away! I forgive you; it is quite natural at your age. I was like that myself once. Only remember this, you will do worse things yourself some day. You will flirt with some pretty woman and take her money. You have thought of that, of course," said Vautrin, "for how are you to succeed unless love is laid under contribution? There are no two ways about virtue, my dear student; it either is, or it is not. Talk of doing penance for your sins! It is a nice system of business, when you pay for your crime by an act of contrition! You seduce a woman that you may set your foot on such and such a rung of the social ladder; you sow dissension among the children of a family; you descend, in short, to every base action that can be committed at home or abroad, to gain your own ends for your own pleasure or your profit; and can you imagine that these are acts of faith, hope, or charity? How is it that a dandy, who in a night has robbed a boy of half his fortune, gets only a couple of months in prison; while a poor devil who steals a banknote for a thousand francs, with aggravating circumstances, is condemned to penal servitude? Those are your laws. Not a single provision but lands you in some absurdity. That man with yellow gloves and a golden tongue commits many a murder; he sheds no blood, but he drains his victim's veins as surely; a desperado forces open a door with a crowbar, dark deeds both of them! You yourself will do every one of those things that I suggest to you to-day, bar the bloodshed. Do you believe that there is any absolute standard in this world? Despise mankind and find out the meshes that you can slip through in the net of the Code. The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly executed."

　　"Silence, sir! I will not hear any more; you make me doubt myself. At this moment my sentiments are all my science."

　　"Just as you please, my fine fellow; I did think you were so weak-minded," said Vautrin, "I shall say no more about it. One last word, however," and he looked hard at the student--"you have my secret," he said.

　　"A young man who refuses your offer knows that he must forget it."

　　"Quite right, quite right; I am glad to hear you say so. Somebody else might not be so scrupulous, you see. Keep in mind what I want to do for you. I will give you a fortnight. The offer is still open."

　　"What a head of iron the man has!" said Eugene to himself, as he watched Vautrin walk unconcernedly away with his cane under his arm. "Yet Mme. de Beauseant said as much more gracefully; he has only stated the case in cruder language. He would tear my heart with claws of steel. What made me think of going to Mme. de Nucingen? He guessed my motives before I knew them myself. To sum it up, that outlaw has told me more about virtue than all I have learned from men and books. If virtue admits of no compromises, I have certainly robbed my sisters," he said, throwing down the bags on the table.

　　He sat down again and fell, unconscious of his surroundings, into deep thought.

　　"To be faithful to an ideal of virtue! A heroic martyrdom! Pshaw! every one believes in virtue, but who is virtuous? Nations have made an idol of Liberty, but what nation on the face of the earth is free? My youth is still like a blue and cloudless sky. If I set myself to obtain wealth or power, does it mean that I must make up my mind to lie, and fawn, and cringe, and swagger, and flatter, and dissemble? To consent to be the servant of others who have likewise fawned, and lied, and flattered? Must I cringe to them before I can hope to be their accomplice? Well, then, I decline. I mean to work nobly and with a single heart. I will work day and night; I will owe my fortune to nothing but my own exertions. It may be the slowest of all roads to success, but I shall lay my head on the pillow at night untroubled by evil thoughts. Is there a greater thing than this--to look back over your life and know that it is stainless as a lily? I and my life are like a young man and his betrothed. Vautrin has put before me all that comes after ten years of marriage. The devil! my head is swimming. I do not want to think at all; the heart is a sure guide."

　　Eugene was roused from his musings by the voice of the stout Sylvie, who announced that the tailor had come, and Eugene therefore made his appearance before the man with the two money bags, and was not ill pleased that it should be so. When he had tried on his dress suit, he put on his new morning costume, which completely metamorphosed him.

　　"I am quite equal to M. de Trailles," he said to himself. "In short, I look like a gentleman."

　　"You asked me, sir, if I knew the houses where Mme. de Nucingen goes," Father Goriot's voice spoke from the doorway of Eugene's room."

　　"Yes."

　　"Very well then, she is going to the Marechale Carigliano's ball on Monday. If you can manage to be there, I shall hear from you whether my two girls enjoyed themselves, and how they were dressed, and all about it in fact."

　　"How did you find that out, my good Goriot?" said Eugene, putting a chair by the fire for his visitor.

　　"Her maid told me. I hear all about their doings from Therese and Constance," he added gleefully.

　　The old man looked like a lover who is still young enough to be made happy by the discovery of some little stratagem which brings him information of his lady-love without her knowledge.

　　"YOU will see them both!" he said, giving artless expression to a pang of jealousy.

　　"I do not know," answered Eugene. "I will go to Mme. de Beauseant and ask her for an introduction to the Marechale."

　　Eugene felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of appearing before the Vicomtesse, dressed as henceforward he always meant to be. The "abysses of the human heart," in the moralists' phrase, are only insidious thoughts, involuntary promptings of personal interest. The instinct of enjoyment turns the scale; those rapid changes of purpose which have furnished the text for so much rhetoric are calculations prompted by the hope of pleasure. Rastignac beholding himself well dressed and impeccable as to gloves and boots, forgot his virtuous resolutions. Youth, moreover, when bent upon wrongdoing does not dare to behold himself in the mirror of consciousness; mature age has seen itself; and therein lies the whole difference between these two phases of life.

　　A friendship between Eugene and his neighbor, Father Goriot, had been growing up for several days past. This secret friendship and the antipathy that the student had begun to entertain for Vautrin arose from the same psychological causes. The bold philosopher who shall investigate the effects of mental action upon the physical world will doubtless find more than one proof of the material nature of our sentiments in other animals. What physiognomist is as quick to discern character as a dog is to discover from a stranger's face whether this is a friend or no? Those by-words--"atoms," "affinities"--are facts surviving in modern languages for the confusion of philosophic wiseacres who amuse themselves by winnowing the chaff of language to find its grammatical roots. We FEEL that we are loved. Our sentiments make themselves felt in everything, even at a great distance. A letter is a living soul, and so faithful an echo of the voice that speaks in it, that finer natures look upon a letter as one of love's most precious treasures. Father Goriot's affection was of the instinctive order, a canine affection raised to a sublime pitch; he had scented compassion in the air, and the kindly respect and youthful sympathy in the student's heart. This friendship had, however, scarcely reached the stage at which confidences are made. Though Eugene had spoken of his wish to meet Mme. de Nucingen, it was not because he counted on the old man to introduce him to her house, for he hoped that his own audacity might stand him in good stead. All that Father Goriot had said as yet about his daughters had referred to the remarks that the student had made so freely in public on that day of the two visits.

　　"How could you think that Mme. de Restaud bore you a grudge for mentioning my name?" he had said on the day following that scene at dinner. "My daughters are very fond of me; I am a happy father; but my sons-in-law have behaved badly to me, and rather than make trouble between my darlings and their husbands, I choose to see my daughters secretly. Fathers who can see their daughters at any time have no idea of all the pleasure that all this mystery gives me; I cannot always see mine when I wish, do you understand? So when it is fine I walk out in the Champs- Elysees, after finding out from their waiting-maids whether my daughters mean to go out. I wait near the entrance; my heart beats fast when the carriages begin to come; I admire them in their dresses, and as they pass they give me a little smile, and it seems as if everything was lighted up for me by a ray of bright sunlight. I wait, for they always go back the same way, and then I see them again; the fresh air has done them good and brought color into their cheeks; all about me people say, 'What a beautiful woman that is!' and it does my heart good to hear them.

　　"Are they not my own flesh and blood? I love the very horses that draw them; I envy the little lap-dog on their knees. Their happiness is my life. Every one loves after his own fashion, and mine does no one any harm; why should people trouble their heads about me? I am happy in my own way. Is there any law against going to see my girls in the evening when they are going out to a ball? And what a disappointment it is when I get there too late, and am told that 'Madame has gone out!' Once I waited till three o'clock in the morning for Nasie; I had not seen her for two whole days. I was so pleased, that it was almost too much for me! Please do not speak of me unless it is to say how good my daughters are to me. They are always wanting to heap presents upon me, but I will not have it. 'Just keep your money,' I tell them. 'What should I do with it? I want nothing.' And what am I, sir, after all? An old carcase, whose soul is always where my daughters are. When you have seen Mme. de Nucingen, tell me which you like the most," said the old man after a moment's pause, while Eugene put the last touches to his toilette. The student was about to go out to walk in the Garden of the Tuileries until the hour when he could venture to appear in Mme. de Beauseant's drawing-room.

　　That walk was a turning-point in Eugene's career. Several women noticed him; he looked so handsome, so young, and so well dressed. This almost admiring attention gave a new turn to his thoughts. He forgot his sisters and the aunt who had robbed herself for him; he no longer remembered his own virtuous scruples. He had seen hovering above his head the fiend so easy to mistake for an angel, the Devil with rainbow wings, who scatters rubies, and aims his golden shafts at palace fronts, who invests women with purple, and thrones with a glory that dazzles the eyes of fools till they forget the simple origins of royal dominion; he had heard the rustle of that Vanity whose tinsel seems to us to be the symbol of power. However cynical Vautrin's words had been, they had made an impression on his mind, as the sordid features of the old crone who whispers, "A lover, and gold in torrents," remain engraven on a young girl's memory.

　　Eugene lounged about the walks till it was nearly five o'clock, then he went to Mme. de Beauseant, and received one of the terrible blows against which young hearts are defenceless. Hitherto the Vicomtesse had received him with the kindly urbanity, the bland grace of manner that is the result of fine breeding, but is only complete when it comes from the heart.

　　Today Mme. de Beauseant bowed constrainedly, and spoke curtly:

　　"M. de Rastignac, I cannot possibly see you, at least not at this moment. I am engaged . . ."

　　An observer, and Rastignac instantly became an observer, could read the whole history, the character and customs of caste, in the phrase, in the tones of her voice, in her glance and bearing. He caught a glimpse of the iron hand beneath the velvet glove-- the personality, the egoism beneath the manner, the wood beneath the varnish. In short, he heard that unmistakable I THE KING that issues from the plumed canopy of the throne, and finds its last echo under the crest of the simplest gentleman.

　　Eugene had trusted too implicitly to the generosity of a woman; he could not believe in her haughtiness. Like all the unfortunate, he had subscribed, in all good faith, the generous compact which should bind the benefactor to the recipient, and the first article in that bond, between two large-hearted natures, is a perfect equality. The kindness which knits two souls together is as rare, as divine, and as little understood as the passion of love, for both love and kindness are the lavish generosity of noble natures. Rastignac was set upon going to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball, so he swallowed down this rebuff.

　　"Madame," he faltered out, "I would not have come to trouble you about a trifling matter; be so kind as to permit me to see you later, I can wait."

　　"Very well, come and dine with me," she said, a little confused by the harsh way in which she had spoken, for this lady was as genuinely kind-hearted as she was high-born.

　　Eugene was touched by this sudden relenting, but none the less he said to himself as he went away, "Crawl in the dust, put up with every kind of treatment. What must the rest of the world be like when one of the kindest of women forgets all her promises of befriending me in a moment, and tosses me aside like an old shoe? So it is every one for himself? It is true that her house is not a shop, and I have put myself in the wrong by needing her help. You should cut your way through the world like a cannon ball, as Vautrin said."

　　But the student's bitter thoughts were soon dissipated by the pleasure which he promised himself in this dinner with the Vicomtesse. Fate seemed to determine that the smallest accidents in his life should combine to urge him into a career, which the terrible sphinx of the Maison Vauquer had described as a field of battle where you must either slay or be slain, and cheat to avoid being cheated. You leave your conscience and your heart at the barriers, and wear a mask on entering into this game of grim earnest, where, as in ancient Sparta, you must snatch your prize without being detected if you would deserve the crown.

　　On his return he found the Vicomtesse gracious and kindly, as she had always been to him. They went together to the dining-room, where the Vicomte was waiting for his wife. In the time of the Restoration the luxury of the table was carried, as is well known, to the highest degree, and M. de Beauseant, like many jaded men of the world, had few pleasures left but those of good cheer; in this matter, in fact, he was a gourmand of the schools of Louis XVIII. and of the Duc d'Escars, and luxury was supplemented by splendor. Eugene, dining for the first time in a house where the traditions of grandeur had descended through many generations, had never seen any spectacle like this that now met his eyes. In the time of the Empire, balls had always ended with a supper, because the officers who took part in them must be fortified for immediate service, and even in Paris might be called upon to leave the ballroom for the battlefield. This arrangement had gone out of fashion under the Monarchy, and Eugene had so far only been asked to dances. The self-possession which pre-eminently distinguished him in later life already stood him in good stead, and he did not betray his amazement. Yet as he saw for the first time the finely wrought silver plate, the completeness of every detail, the sumptuous dinner, noiselessly served, it was difficult for such an ardent imagination not to prefer this life of studied and refined luxury to the hardships of the life which he had chosen only that morning.

　　His thoughts went back for a moment to the lodging-house, and with a feeling of profound loathing, he vowed to himself that at New Year he would go; prompted at least as much by a desire to live among cleaner surroundings as by a wish to shake off Vautrin, whose huge hand he seemed to feel on his shoulder at that moment. When you consider the numberless forms, clamorous or mute, that corruption takes in Paris, common-sense begins to wonder what mental aberration prompted the State to establish great colleges and schools there, and assemble young men in the capital; how it is that pretty women are respected, or that the gold coin displayed in the money-changer's wooden saucers does not take to itself wings in the twinkling of an eye; and when you come to think further, how comparatively few cases of crime there are, and to count up the misdemeanors committed by youth, is there not a certain amount of respect due to these patient Tantaluses who wrestle with themselves and nearly always come off victorious? The struggles of the poor student in Paris, if skilfully drawn, would furnish a most dramatic picture of modern civilization.

　　In vain Mme. de Beauseant looked at Eugene as if asking him to speak; the student was tongue-tied in the Vicomte's presence.

　　"Are you going to take me to the Italiens this evening?" the Vicomtesse asked her husband.

　　"You cannot doubt that I should obey you with pleasure," he answered, and there was a sarcastic tinge in his politeness which Eugene did not detect, "but I ought to go to meet some one at the Varietes."

　　"His mistress," said she to herself.

　　"Then, is not Ajuda coming for you this evening?" inquired the Vicomte.

　　"No," she answered, petulantly.

　　"Very well, then, if you really must have an arm, take that of M. de Rastignac."

　　The Vicomtess turned to Eugene with a smile.

　　"That would be a very compromising step for you," she said.

　　" 'A Frenchman loves danger, because in danger there is glory,' to quote M. de Chateaubriand," said Rastignac, with a bow.

　　A few moments later he was sitting beside Mme. de Beauseant in a brougham, that whirled them through the streets of Paris to a fashionable theatre. It seemed to him that some fairy magic had suddenly transported him into a box facing the stage. All the lorgnettes of the house were pointed at him as he entered, and at the Vicomtesse in her charming toilette. He went from enchantment to enchantment.

　　"You must talk to me, you know," said Mme. de Beauseant. "Ah! look! There is Mme. de Nucingen in the third box from ours. Her sister and M. de Trailles are on the other side."

　　The Vicomtesse glanced as she spoke at the box where Mlle. de Rochefide should have been; M. d'Ajuda was not there, and Mme. de Beauseant's face lighted up in a marvelous way.

　　"She is charming," said Eugene, after looking at Mme. de Nucingen.

　　"She has white eyelashes."

　　"Yes, but she has such a pretty slender figure!"

　　"Her hands are large."

　　"Such beautiful eyes!"

　　"Her face is long."

　　"Yes, but length gives distinction."

　　"It is lucky for her that she has some distinction in her face. Just see how she fidgets with her opera-glass! The Goriot blood shows itself in every movement," said the Vicomtesse, much to Eugene's astonishment.

　　Indeed, Mme. de Beauseant seemed to be engaged in making a survey of the house, and to be unconscious of Mme. Nucingen's existence; but no movement made by the latter was lost upon the Vicomtesse. The house was full of the loveliest women in Paris, so that Delphine de Nucingen was not a little flattered to receive the undivided attention of Mme. de Beauseant's young, handsome, and well-dressed cousin, who seemed to have no eyes for any one else.

　　"If you look at her so persistently, you will make people talk, M. de Rastignac. You will never succeed if you fling yourself at any one's head like that."

　　"My dear cousin," said Eugene, "you have protected me indeed so far, and now if you would complete your work, I only ask of you a favor which will cost you but little, and be of very great service to me. I have lost my heart."

　　"Already!"

　　"Yes."

　　"And to that woman!"

　　"How could I aspire to find any one else to listen to me?" he asked, with a keen glance at his cousin. "Her Grace the Duchesse de Carigliano is a friend of the Duchesse de Berri," he went on, after a pause; "you are sure to see her, will you be so kind as to present me to her, and to take me to her ball on Monday? I shall meet Mme. de Nucingen there, and enter into my first skirmish."

　　"Willingly," she said. "If you have a liking for her already, your affairs of the heart are like to prosper. That is de Marsay over there in the Princesse Galathionne's box. Mme. de Nucingen is racked with jealousy. There is no better time for approaching a woman, especially if she happens to be a banker's wife. All those ladies of the Chaussee-d'Antin love revenge."

　　"Then, what would you do yourself in such a case?"

　　"I should suffer in silence."

　　At this point the Marquis d'Ajuda appeared in Mme. de Beauseant's box.

　　"I have made a muddle of my affairs to come to you," he said, "and I am telling you about it, so that it may not be a sacrifice."

　　Eugene saw the glow of joy on the Vicomtesse's face, and knew that this was love, and learned the difference between love and the affectations of Parisian coquetry. He admired his cousin, grew mute, and yielded his place to M. d'Ajuda with a sigh.

　　"How noble, how sublime a woman is when she loves like that!" he said to himself. "And HE could forsake her for a doll! Oh! how could any one forsake her?"

　　There was a boy's passionate indignation in his heart. He could have flung himself at Mme. de Beauseant's feet; he longed for the power of the devil if he could snatch her away and hide her in his heart, as an eagle snatches up some white yeanling from the plains and bears it to its eyrie. It was humiliating to him to think that in all this gallery of fair pictures he had not one picture of his own. "To have a mistress and an almost royal position is a sign of power," he said to himself. And he looked at Mme. de Nucingen as a man measures another who has insulted him.

　　The Vicomtesse turned to him, and the expression of her eyes thanked him a thousand times for his discretion. The first act came to an end just then.

　　"Do you know Mme. de Nucingen well enough to present M. de Rastignac to her?" she asked of the Marquis d'Ajuda.

　　"She will be delighted," said the Marquis. The handsome Portuguese rose as he spoke and took the student's arm, and in another moment Eugene found himself in Mme. de Nucingen's box.

　　"Madame," said the Marquis, "I have the honor of presenting to you the Chevalier Eugene de Rastignac; he is a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant's. You have made so deep an impression upon him, that I thought I would fill up the measure of his happiness by bringing him nearer to his divinity."

　　Words spoken half jestingly to cover their somewhat disrespectful import; but such an implication, if carefully disguised, never gives offence to a woman. Mme. de Nucingen smiled, and offered Eugene the place which her husband had just left.

　　"I do not venture to suggest that you should stay with me, monsieur," she said. "Those who are so fortunate as to be in Mme. de Beauseant's company do not desire to leave it."

　　"Madame," Eugene said, lowering his voice, "I think that to please my cousin I should remain with you. Before my lord Marquis came we were speaking of you and of your exceedingly distinguished appearance," he added aloud.

　　M. d'Ajuda turned and left them.

　　"Are you really going to stay with me, monsieur?" asked the Baroness. "Then we shall make each other's acquaintance. Mme. de Restaud told me about you, and has made me anxious to meet you."

　　"She must be very insincere, then, for she has shut her door on me."

　　"What?"

　　"Madame, I will tell you honestly the reason why; but I must crave your indulgence before confiding such a secret to you. I am your father's neighbor; I had no idea that Mme. de Restaud was his daughter. I was rash enough to mention his name; I meant no harm, but I annoyed your sister and her husband very much. You cannot think how severely the Duchesse de Langeais and my cousin blamed this apostasy on a daughter's part, as a piece of bad taste. I told them all about it, and they both burst out laughing. Then Mme. de Beauseant made some comparison between you and your sister, speaking in high terms of you, and saying how very fond you were of my neighbor, M. Goriot. And, indeed, how could you help loving him? He adores you so passionately that I am jealous already. We talked about you this morning for two hours. So this evening I was quite full of all that your father had told me, and while I was dining with my cousin I said that you could not be as beautiful as affectionate. Mme. de Beauseant meant to gratify such warm admiration, I think, when she brought me here, telling me, in her gracious way, that I should see you."

　　"Then, even now, I owe you a debt of gratitude, monsieur," said the banker's wife. "We shall be quite old friends in a little while."

　　"Although a friendship with you could not be like an ordinary friendship," said Rastignac; "I should never wish to be your friend."

　　Such stereotyped phrases as these, in the mouths of beginners, possess an unfailing charm for women, and are insipid only when read coldly; for a young man's tone, glance and attitude give a surpassing eloquence to the banal phrases. Mme. de Nucingen thought that Rastignac was adorable. Then, woman-like, being at a loss how to reply to the student's outspoken admiration, she answered a previous remark.

　　"Yes, it is very wrong of my sister to treat our poor father as she does," she said; "he has been a Providence to us. It was not until M. de Nucingen positively ordered me only to receive him in the mornings that I yielded the point. But I have been unhappy about it for a long while; I have shed many tears over it. This violence to my feelings, with my husband's brutal treatment, have been two causes of my unhappy married life. There is certainly no woman in Paris whose lot seems more enviable than mine, and yet, in reality, there is not one so much to be pitied. You will think I must be out of my senses to talk to you like this; but you know my father, and I cannot regard you as a stranger."

　　"You will find no one," said Eugene, "who longs as eagerly as I do to be yours. What do all women seek? Happiness." (He answered his own question in low, vibrating tones.) "And if happiness for a woman means that she is to be loved and adored, to have a friend to whom she can pour out her wishes, her fancies, her sorrows and joys; to whom she can lay bare her heart and soul, and all her fair defects and her gracious virtues, without fear of a betrayal; believe me, the devotion and the warmth that never fails can only be found in the heart of a young man who, at a bare sign from you, would go to his death, who neither knows nor cares to know anything as yet of the world, because you will be all the world to him. I myself, you see (you will laugh at my simplicity), have just come from a remote country district; I am quite new to this world of Paris; I have only known true and loving hearts; and I made up my mind that here I should find no love. Then I chanced to meet my cousin, and to see my cousin's heart from very near; I have divined the inexhaustible treasures of passion, and, like Cherubino, I am the lover of all women, until the day comes when I find THE woman to whom I may devote myself. As soon as I saw you, as soon as I came into the theatre this evening, I felt myself borne towards you as if by the current of a stream. I had so often thought of you already, but I had never dreamed that you would be so beautiful! Mme. de Beauseant told me that I must not look so much at you. She does not know the charm of your red lips, your fair face, nor see how soft your eyes are. . . . I also am beginning to talk nonsense; but let me talk."

　　Nothing pleases a woman better than to listen to such whispered words as these; the most puritanical among them listens even when she ought not to reply to them; and Rastignac, having once begun, continued to pour out his story, dropping his voice, that she might lean and listen; and Mme. de Nucingen, smiling, glanced from time to time at de Marsay, who still sat in the Princesse Galathionne's box.

　　Rastignac did not leave Mme. de Nucingen till her husband came to take her home.

　　"Madame," Eugene said, "I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you before the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball."

　　"If Matame infites you to come," said the Baron, a thickset Alsatian, with indications of a sinister cunning in his full-moon countenance, "you are quide sure of being well receifed."

　　"My affairs seem to be in a promising way," said Eugene to himself.--" 'Can you love me?' I asked her, and she did not resent it. The bit is in the horse's mouth, and I have only to mount and ride;" and with that he went to pay his respects to Mme. de Beauseant, who was leaving the theatre on d'Ajuda's arm.

　　The student did not know that the Baroness' thoughts had been wandering; that she was even then expecting a letter from de Marsay, one of those letters that bring about a rupture that rends the soul; so, happy in his delusion, Eugene went with the Vicomtesse to the peristyle, where people were waiting till their carriages were announced.

　　"That cousin of yours is hardly recognizable for the same man," said the Portuguese laughingly to the Vicomtesse, when Eugene had taken leave of them. "He will break the bank. He is as supple as an eel; he will go a long way, of that I am sure. Who else could have picked out a woman for him, as you did, just when she needed consolation?"

　　"But it is not certain that she does not still love the faithless lover," said Mme. de Beauseant.

　　The student meanwhile walked back from the Theatre-Italien to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, making the most delightful plans as he went. He had noticed how closely Mme. de Restaud had scrutinized him when he sat beside Mme. de Nucingen, and inferred that the Countess' doors would not be closed in the future. Four important houses were now open to him--for he meant to stand well with the Marechale; he had four supporters in the inmost circle of society in Paris. Even now it was clear to him that, once involved in this intricate social machinery, he must attach himself to a spoke of the wheel that was to turn and raise his fortunes; he would not examine himself too curiously as to the methods, but he was certain of the end, and conscious of the power to gain and keep his hold.

　　"If Mme. de Nucingen takes an interest in me, I will teach her how to manage her husband. That husband of hers is a great speculator; he might put me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke."

　　He did not say this bluntly in so many words; as yet, indeed, he was not sufficient of a diplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its possibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor. These were nothing but hazy ideas that floated over his mental horizon; they were less cynical than Vautrin's notions; but if they had been tried in the crucible of conscience, no very pure result would have issued from the test. It is by a succession of such like transactions that men sink at last to the level of the relaxed morality of this epoch, when there have never been so few of those who square their courses with their theories, so few of those noble characters who do not yield to temptation, for whom the slightest deviation from the line of rectitude is a crime. To these magnificent types of uncompromising Right we owe two masterpieces--the Alceste of Moliere, and, in our own day, the characters of Jeanie Deans and her father in Sir Walter Scott's novel. Perhaps a work which should chronicle the opposite course, which should trace out all the devious courses through which a man of the world, a man of ambitions, drags his conscience, just steering clear of crime that he may gain his end and yet save appearances, such a chronicle would be no less edifying and no less dramatic.

　　Rastignac went home. He was fascinated by Mme. de Nucingen; he seemed to see her before him, slender and graceful as a swallow. He recalled the intoxicating sweetness of her eyes, her fair hair, the delicate silken tissue of the skin, beneath which it almost seemed to him that he could see the blood coursing; the tones of her voice still exerted a spell over him; he had forgotten nothing; his walk perhaps heated his imagination by sending a glow of warmth through his veins. He knocked unceremoniously at Goriot's door.

　　"I have seen Mme. Delphine, neighbor," said he.

　　"Where?"

　　"At the Italiens."

　　"Did she enjoy it?. . . . Just come inside," and the old man left his bed, unlocked the door, and promptly returned again.

　　It was the first time that Eugene had been in Father Goriot's room, and he could not control his feeling of amazement at the contrast between the den in which the father lived and the costume of the daughter whom he had just beheld. The window was curtainless, the walls were damp, in places the varnished wall- paper had come away and gave glimpses of the grimy yellow plaster beneath. The wretched bed on which the old man lay boasted but one thin blanket, and a wadded quilt made out of large pieces of Mme. Vauquer's old dresses. The floor was damp and gritty. Opposite the window stood a chest of drawers made of rosewood, one of the old-fashioned kind with a curving front and brass handles, shaped like rings of twisted vine stems covered with flowers and leaves. On a venerable piece of furniture with a wooden shelf stood a ewer and basin and shaving apparatus. A pair of shoes stood in one corner; a night-table by the bed had neither a door nor marble slab. There was not a trace of a fire in the empty grate; the square walnut table with the crossbar against which Father Goriot had crushed and twisted his posset- dish stood near the hearth. The old man's hat was lying on a broken-down bureau. An armchair stuffed with straw and a couple of chairs completed the list of ramshackle furniture. From the tester of the bed, tied to the ceiling by a piece of rag, hung a strip of some cheap material in large red and black checks. No poor drudge in a garret could be worse lodged than Father Goriot in Mme. Vauquer's lodging-house. The mere sight of the room sent a chill through you and a sense of oppression; it was like the worst cell in a prison. Luckily, Goriot could not see the effect that his surroundings produced on Eugene as the latter deposited his candle on the night-table. The old man turned round, keeping the bedclothes huddled up to his chin.

　　"Well," he said, "and which do you like the best, Mme. de Restaud or Mme. de Nucingen?"

　　"I like Mme. Delphine the best," said the law student, "because she loves you the best."

　　At the words so heartily spoken the old man's hand slipped out from under the bedclothes and grasped Eugene's.

　　"Thank you, thank you," he said, gratefully. "Then what did she say about me?"

　　The student repeated the Baroness' remarks with some embellishments of his own, the old man listening the while as though he heard a voice from Heaven.

　　"Dear child!" he said. "Yes, yes, she is very fond of me. But you must not believe all that she tells you about Anastasie. The two sisters are jealous of each other, you see, another proof of their affection. Mme. de Restaud is very fond of me too. I know she is. A father sees his children as God sees all of us; he looks into the very depths of their hearts; he knows their intentions; and both of them are so loving. Oh! if I only had good sons-in-law, I should be too happy, and I dare say there is no perfect happiness here below. If I might live with them-- simply hear their voices, know that they are there, see them go and come as I used to do at home when they were still with me; why, my heart bounds at the thought. . . . Were they nicely dressed?"

　　"Yes," said Eugene. "But, M. Goriot, how is it that your daughters have such fine houses, while you live in such a den as this?"

　　"Dear me, why should I want anything better?" he replied, with seeming carelessness. "I can't quite explain to you how it is; I am not used to stringing words together properly, but it all lies there----" he said, tapping his heart. "My real life is in my two girls, you see; and so long as they are happy, and smartly dressed, and have soft carpets under their feet, what does it matter what clothes I wear or where I lie down of a night? I shall never feel cold so long as they are warm; I shall never feel dull if they are laughing. I have no troubles but theirs. When you, too, are a father, and you hear your children's little voices, you will say to yourself, 'That has all come from me.' You will feel that those little ones are akin to every drop in your veins, that they are the very flower of your life (and what else are they?); you will cleave so closely to them that you seem to feel every movement that they make. Everywhere I hear their voices sounding in my ears. If they are sad, the look in their eyes freezes my blood. Some day you will find out that there is far more happiness in another's happiness than in your own. It is something that I cannot explain, something within that sends a glow of warmth all through you. In short, I live my life three times over. Shall I tell you something funny? Well, then, since I have been a father, I have come to understand God. He is everywhere in the world, because the whole world comes from Him. And it is just the same with my children, monsieur. Only, I love my daughters better than God loves the world, for the world is not so beautiful as God Himself is, but my children are more beautiful than I am. Their lives are so bound up with mine that I felt somehow that you would see them this evening. Great Heaven! If any man would make my little Delphine as happy as a wife is when she is loved, I would black his boots and run on his errands. That miserable M. de Marsay is a cur; I know all about him from her maid. A longing to wring his neck comes over me now and then. He does not love her! does not love a pearl of a woman, with a voice like a nightingale and shaped like a model. Where can her eyes have been when she married that great lump of an Alsatian? They ought both of them to have married young men, good-looking and good-tempered--but, after all, they had their own way."

　　Father Goriot was sublime. Eugene had never yet seen his face light up as it did now with the passionate fervor of a father's love. It is worthy of remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and pervasive power; the roughest nature, in the endeavor to express a deep and sincere affection, communicates to others the influence that has put resonance into the voice, and eloquence into every gesture, wrought a change in the very features of the speaker; for under the inspiration of passion the stupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence of ideas, if not of language, and seems to move in some sphere of light. In the old man's tones and gesture there was something just then of the same spell that a great actor exerts over his audience. But does not the poet in us find expression in our affections?

　　"Well," said Eugene, "perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she is pretty sure to break with de Marsay before long. That sprig of fashion has left her for the Princesse Galathionne. For my part, I fell in love with Mme. Delphine this evening."

　　"Stuff!" said Father Goriot.

　　"I did indeed, and she did not regard me with aversion. For a whole hour we talked of love, and I am to go to call on her on Saturday, the day after to-morrow."

　　"Oh! how I should love you, if she should like you. You are kind- hearted; you would never make her miserable. If you were to forsake her, I would cut your throat at once. A woman does not love twice, you see! Good heavens! what nonsense I am talking, M. Eugene! It is cold; you ought not to stay here. MON DIEU! so you have heard her speak? What message did she give you for me?"

　　"None at all," said Eugene to himself; aloud he answered, "She told me to tell you that your daughter sends you a good kiss."

　　"Good-night, neighbor! Sleep well, and pleasant dreams to you! I have mine already made for me by that message from her. May God grant you all your desires! You have come in like a good angel on me to-night, and brought with you the air that my daughter breathes."

　　"Poor old fellow!" said Eugene as he lay down. "It is enough to melt a heart of stone. His daughter no more thought of him than of the Grand Turk."

　　Ever after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a friend, a confidant such as he had never hoped to find; and there was established between the two the only relationship that could attach this old man to another man. The passions never miscalculate. Father Goriot felt that this friendship brought him closer to his daughter Delphine; he thought that he should find a warmer welcome for himself if the Baroness should care for Eugene. Moreover, he had confided one of his troubles to the younger man. Mme. de Nucingen, for whose happiness he prayed a thousand times daily, had never known the joys of love. Eugene was certainly (to make use of his own expression) one of the nicest young men that he had ever seen, and some prophetic instinct seemed to tell him that Eugene was to give her the happiness which had not been hers. These were the beginnings of a friendship that grew up between the old man and his neighbor; but for this friendship the catastrophe of the drama must have remained a mystery.

　　The affection with which Father Goriot regarded Eugene, by whom he seated himself at breakfast, the change in Goriot's face, which as a rule, looked as expressionless as a plaster cast, and a few words that passed between the two, surprised the other lodgers. Vautrin, who saw Eugene for the first time since their interview, seemed as if he would fain read the student's very soul. During the night Eugene had had some time in which to scan the vast field which lay before him; and now, as he remembered yesterday's proposal, the thought of Mlle. Taillefer's dowry came, of course, to his mind, and he could not help thinking of Victorine as the most exemplary youth may think of an heiress. It chanced that their eyes met. The poor girl did not fail to see that Eugene looked very handsome in his new clothes. So much was said in the glance, thus exchanged, that Eugene could not doubt but that he was associated in her mind with the vague hopes that lie dormant in a girl's heart and gather round the first attractive newcomer. "Eight hundred thousand francs!" a voice cried in his ears, but suddenly he took refuge in the memories of yesterday evening, thinking that his extemporized passion for Mme. de Nucingen was a talisman that would preserve him from this temptation.

　　"They gave Rossini's Barber of Seville at the Italiens yesterday evening," he remarked. "I never heard such delicious music. Good gracious! how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens!"

　　Father Goriot drank in every word that Eugene let fall, and watched him as a dog watches his master's slightest movement.

　　"You men are like fighting cocks," said Mme. Vauquer; "you do what you like."

　　"How did you get back?" inquired Vautrin.

　　"I walked," answered Eugene.

　　"For my own part," remarked the tempter, "I do not care about doing things by halves. If I want to enjoy myself that way, I should prefer to go in my carriage, sit in my own box, and do the thing comfortably. Everything or nothing; that is my motto."

　　"And a good one, too," commented Mme. Vauquer.

　　"Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen to-day," said Eugene, addressing Goriot in an undertone. "She will welcome you with open arms, I am sure; she would want to ask you for all sorts of little details about me. I have found out that she will do anything in the world to be known by my cousin Mme. de Beauseant; don't forget to tell her that I love her too well not to think of trying to arrange this."

　　Rastignac went at once to the Ecole de Droit. He had no mind to stay a moment longer than was necessary in that odious house. He wasted his time that day; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the brain that accompanies the too vivid hopes of youth. Vautrin's arguments had set him meditating on social life, and he was deep in these reflections when he happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du Luxembourg.

　　"What makes you look so solemn?" said the medical student, putting an arm through Eugene's as they went towards the Palais.

　　"I am tormented by temptations."

　　"What kind? There is a cure for temptation."

　　"What?"

　　"Yielding to it."

　　"You laugh, but you don't know what it is all about. Have you read Rousseau?"

　　"Yes."

　　"Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if he could make a fortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China by mere force of wishing it, and without stirring from Paris?"

　　"Yes."

　　"Well, then?"

　　"Pshaw! I am at my thirty-third mandarin."

　　"Seriously, though. Look here, suppose you were sure that you could do it, and had only to give a nod. Would you do it?"

　　"Is he well stricken in years, this mandarin of yours? Pshaw! after all, young or old, paralytic, or well and sound, my word for it. . . . Well, then. Hang it, no!"

　　"You are a good fellow, Bianchon. But suppose you loved a woman well enough to lose your soul in hell for her, and that she wanted money for dresses and a carriage, and all her whims, in fact?"

　　"Why, here you are taking away my reason, and want me to reason!"

　　"Well, then, Bianchon, I am mad; bring me to my senses. I have two sisters as beautiful and innocent as angels, and I want them to be happy. How am I to find two hundred thousand francs apiece for them in the next five years? Now and then in life, you see, you must play for heavy stakes, and it is no use wasting your luck on low play."

　　"But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at the outset of his life, and you want to cut the Gordian knot with a sword. If that is the way of it, dear boy, you must be an Alexander, or to the hulks you go. For my own part, I am quite contented with the little lot I mean to make for myself somewhere in the country, when I mean to step into my father's shoes and plod along. A man's affections are just as fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a vast circumference. Napoleon himself could only dine once, and he could not have more mistresses than a house student at the Capuchins. Happiness, old man, depends on what lies between the sole of your foot and the crown of your head; and whether it costs a million or a hundred louis, the actual amount of pleasure that you receive rests entirely with you, and is just exactly the same in any case. I am for letting that Chinaman live."

　　"Thank you, Bianchon; you have done me good. We will always be friends."

　　"I say," remarked the medical student, as they came to the end of a broad walk in the Jardin des Plantes, "I saw the Michonneau and Poiret a few minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom I used to see in last year's troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies; he seems to me, in fact, to be a detective dressed up like a decent retired tradesman. Let us keep an eye on that couple; I will tell you why some time. Good-bye; it is nearly four o'clock, and I must be in to answer to my name."

　　When Eugene reached the lodging-house, he found Father Goriot waiting for him.

　　"Here," cried the old man, "here is a letter from her. Pretty handwriting, eh?"

　　Eugene broke the seal and read:--

　　"Sir,--I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian music. I shall be delighted if you will do me the pleasure of accepting a seat in my box. La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on Saturday, so I am sure that you will not refuse me. M. de Nucingen and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us; we shall be quite by ourselves. If you will come and be my escort, my husband will be glad to be relieved from his conjugal duties. Do not answer, but simply come.--Yours sincerely, D. DE N."

　　"Let me see it," said Father Goriot, when Eugene had read the letter. "You are going, aren't you?" he added, when he had smelled the writing-paper. "How nice it smells! Her fingers have touched it, that is certain."

　　"A woman does not fling herself at a man's head in this way," the student was thinking. "She wants to use me to bring back de Marsay; nothing but pique makes a woman do a thing like this."

　　"Well," said Father Goriot, "what are you thinking about?"

　　Eugene did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in those days; how should he imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a banker's wife would go to almost any length. For the coterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle, and the women who moved in it were at that time the queens of society; and among the greatest of these Dames du Petit-Chateau, as they were called, were Mme. de Beauseant and her friends the Duchesse de Langeais and the Duchesse de Maufrigneause. Rastignac was alone in his ignorance of the frantic efforts made by women who lived in the Chausee-d'Antin to enter this seventh heaven and shine among the brightest constellations of their sex. But his cautious disposition stood him in good stead, and kept his judgment cool, and the not altogether enviable power of imposing instead of accepting conditions.

　　"Yes, I am going," he replied.

　　So it was curiosity that drew him to Mme. de Nucingen; while, if she had treated him disdainfully, passion perhaps might have brought him to her feet. Still he waited almost impatiently for to-morrow, and the hour when he could go to her. There is almost as much charm for a young man in a first flirtation as there is in first love. The certainty of success is a source of happiness to which men do not confess, and all the charm of certain women lies in this. The desire of conquest springs no less from the easiness than from the difficulty of triumph, and every passion is excited or sustained by one or the other of these two motives which divide the empire of love. Perhaps this division is one result of the great question of temperaments; which, after all, dominates social life. The melancholic temperament may stand in need of the tonic of coquetry, while those of nervous or sanguine complexion withdraw if they meet with a too stubborn resistance. In other words, the lymphatic temperament is essentially despondent, and the rhapsodic is bilious.

　　Eugene lingered over his toilette with an enjoyment of all its little details that is grateful to a young man's self-love, though he will not own to it for fear of being laughed at. He thought, as he arranged his hair, that a pretty woman's glances would wander through the dark curls. He indulged in childish tricks like any young girl dressing for a dance, and gazed complacently at his graceful figure while he smoothed out the creases of his coat.

　　"There are worse figures, that is certain," he said to himself.

　　Then he went downstairs, just as the rest of the household were sitting down to dinner, and took with good humor the boisterous applause excited by his elegant appearance. The amazement with which any attention to dress is regarded in a lodging-house is a very characteristic trait. No one can put on a new coat but every one else must say his say about it.

　　"Clk! clk! clk!" cried Bianchon, making the sound with his tongue against the roof of his mouth, like a driver urging on a horse.

　　"He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France," said Mme. Vauquer.

　　"Are you going a-courting?" inquired Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" cried the artist.

　　"My compliments to my lady your wife," from the employe at the Museum.

　　"Your wife; have you a wife?" asked Poiret.

　　"Yes, in compartments, water-tight and floats, guaranteed fast color, all prices from twenty-five to forty sous, neat check patterns in the latest fashion and best taste, will wash, half- linen, half-cotton, half-wool; a certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the patronage of the Royal College of Physicians! children like it! a remedy for headache, indigestion, and all other diseases affecting the throat, eyes, and ears!" cried Vautrin, with a comical imitation of the volubility of a quack at a fair. "And how much shall we say for this marvel, gentlemen? Twopence? No. Nothing of the sort. All that is left in stock after supplying the Great Mogul. All the crowned heads of Europe, including the Gr-r-rand Duke of Baden, have been anxious to get a sight of it. Walk up! walk up! gentlemen! Pay at the desk as you go in! Strike up the music there! Brooum, la, la, trinn! la, la, boum! boum! Mister Clarinette, there you are out of tune!" he added gruffly; "I will rap your knuckles for you!"

　　"Goodness! what an amusing man!" said Mme. Vauquer to Mme. Couture; "I should never feel dull with him in the house."

　　This burlesque of Vautrin's was the signal for an outburst of merriment, and under cover of jokes and laughter Eugene caught a glance from Mlle. Taillefer; she had leaned over to say a few words in Mme. Couture's ear.

　　"The cab is at the door," announced Sylvie.

　　"But where is he going to dine?" asked Bianchon.

　　"With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen."

　　"M. Goriot's daughter," said the law student.

　　At this, all eyes turned to the old vermicelli maker; he was gazing at Eugene with something like envy in his eyes.

　　Rastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare, one of those many-windowed houses with a mean-looking portico and slender columns, which are considered the thing in Paris, a typical banker's house, decorated in the most ostentatious fashion; the walls lined with stucco, the landings of marble mosaic. Mme. de Nucingen was sitting in a little drawing-room; the room was painted in the Italian fashion, and decorated like a restaurant. The Baroness seemed depressed. The effort that she made to hide her feelings aroused Eugene's interest; it was plain that she was not playing a part. He had expected a little flutter of excitement at his coming, and he found her dispirited and sad. The disappointment piqued his vanity.

　　"My claim to your confidence is very small, madame," he said, after rallying her on her abstracted mood; "but if I am in the way, please tell me so frankly; I count on your good faith."

　　"No, stay with me," she said; "I shall be all alone if you go. Nucingen is dining in town, and I do not want to be alone; I want to be taken out of myself."

　　"But what is the matter?"

　　"You are the very last person whom I should tell," she exclaimed.

　　"Then I am connected in some way in this secret. I wonder what it is?"

　　"Perhaps. Yet, no," she went on; "it is a domestic quarrel, which ought to be buried in the depths of the heart. I am very unhappy; did I not tell you so the day before yesterday? Golden chains are the heaviest of all fetters."

　　When a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy, and when the young man is clever, and well dressed, and has fifteen hundred francs lying idle in his pocket, he is sure to think as Eugene said, and he becomes a coxcomb.

　　"What can you have left to wish for?" he answered. "You are young, beautiful, beloved, and rich."

　　"Do not let us talk of my affairs," she said shaking her head mournfully. "We will dine together tete-a-tete, and afterwards we will go to hear the most exquisite music. Am I to your taste?" she went on, rising and displaying her gown of white cashmere, covered with Persian designs in the most superb taste.

　　"I wish that you were altogether mine," said Eugene; "you are charming."

　　"You would have a forlorn piece of property," she said, smiling bitterly. "There is nothing about me that betrays my wretchedness; and yet, in spite of appearances, I am in despair. I cannot sleep; my troubles have broken my night's rest; I shall grow ugly."

　　"Oh! that is impossible," cried the law student; "but I am curious to know what these troubles can be that a devoted love cannot efface."

　　"Ah! if I were to tell you about them, you would shun me," she said. "Your love for me is as yet only the conventional gallantry that men use to masquerade in; and, if you really loved me, you would be driven to despair. I must keep silence, you see. Let us talk of something else, for pity's sake," she added. "Let me show you my rooms."

　　"No; let us stay here," answered Eugene; he sat down on the sofa before the fire, and boldly took Mme. de Nucingen's hand in his. She surrendered it to him; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one of the spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation.

　　"Listen," said Rastignac; "if you are in trouble, you ought to tell me about it. I want to prove to you that I love you for yourself alone. You must speak to me frankly about your troubles, so that I can put an end to them, even if I have to kill half-a- dozen men; or I shall go, never to return."

　　"Very well," she cried, putting her hand to her forehead in an agony of despair, "I will put you to the proof, and this very moment. Yes," she said to herself, "I have no other resource left."

　　She rang the bell.

　　"Are the horses put in for the master?" she asked of the servant.

　　"Yes, madame."

　　"I shall take his carriage myself. He can have mine and my horses. Serve dinner at seven o'clock."

　　"Now, come with me," she said to Eugene, who thought as he sat in the banker's carriage beside Mme. de Nucingen that he must surely be dreaming.

　　"To the Palais-Royal," she said to the coachman; "stop near the Theatre-Francais."

　　She seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable questions that Eugene put to her. He was at a loss what to think of her mute resistance, her obstinate silence.

　　"Another moment and she will escape me," he said to himself.

　　When the carriage stopped at last, the Baroness gave the law student a glance that silenced his wild words, for he was almost beside himself.

　　"Is it true that you love me?" she asked.

　　"Yes," he answered, and in his manner and tone there was no trace of the uneasiness that he felt.

　　"You will not think ill of me, will you, whatever I may ask of you?"

　　"No."

　　"Are you ready to do my bidding?"

　　"Blindly."

　　"Have you ever been to a gaming-house?" she asked in a tremulous voice.

　　"Never."

　　"Ah! now I can breathe. You will have luck. Here is my purse," she said. "Take it! there are a hundred francs in it, all that such a fortunate woman as I can call her own. Go up into one of the gaming-houses--I do not know where they are, but there are some near the Palais-Royal. Try your luck with the hundred francs at a game they call roulette; lose it all or bring me back six thousand francs. I will tell you about my troubles when you come back."

　　"Devil take me, I'm sure, if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am about, but I will obey you," he added, with inward exultation, as he thought, "She has gone too far to draw back-- she can refuse me nothing now!"

　　Eugene took the dainty little purse, inquired the way of a second-hand clothes-dealer, and hurried to number 9, which happened to be the nearest gaming-house. He mounted the staircase, surrendered his hat, and asked the way to the roulette-table, whither the attendant took him, not a little to the astonishment of the regular comers. All eyes were fixed on Eugene as he asked, without bashfulness, where he was to deposit his stakes.

　　"If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers, and it turns up, you will win thirty-six louis," said a respectable- looking, white-haired old man in answer to his inquiry.

　　Eugene staked the whole of his money on the number 21 (his own age). There was a cry of surprise; before he knew what he had done, he had won.

　　"Take your money off, sir," said the old gentleman; "you don't often win twice running by that system."

　　Eugene took the rake that the old man handed to him, and drew in his three thousand six hundred francs, and, still perfectly ignorant of what he was about, staked again on the red. The bystanders watched him enviously as they saw him continue to play. The disc turned, and again he won; the banker threw him three thousand six hundred francs once more.

　　"You have seven thousand, two hundred francs of your own," the old gentleman said in his ear. "Take my advice and go away with your winnings; red has turned up eight times already. If you are charitable, you will show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a trifle to an old prefect of Napoleon who is down on his luck."

　　Rastignac's head was swimming; he saw ten of his louis pass into the white-haired man's possession, and went down-stairs with his seven thousand francs; he was still ignorant of the game, and stupefied by his luck.

　　"So, that is over; and now where will you take me?" he asked, as soon as the door was closed, and he showed the seven thousand francs to Mme. de Nucingen.

　　Delphine flung her arms about him, but there was no passion in that wild embrace.

　　"You have saved me!" she cried, and tears of joy flowed fast.

　　"I will tell you everything, my friend. For you will be my friend, will you not? I am rich, you think, very rich; I have everything I want, or I seem as if I had everything. Very well, you must know that M. de Nucingen does not allow me the control of a single penny; he pays all the bills for the house expenses; he pays for my carriages and opera box; he does not give me enough to pay for my dress, and he reduces me to poverty in secret on purpose. I am too proud to beg from him. I should be the vilest of women if I could take his money at the price at which he offers it. Do you ask how I, with seven hundred thousand francs of my own, could let myself be robbed? It is because I was proud, and scorned to speak. We are so young, so artless when our married life begins! I never could bring myself to ask my husband for money; the words would have made my lips bleed, I did not dare to ask; I spent my savings first, and then the money that my poor father gave me, then I ran into debt. Marriage for me is a hideous farce; I cannot talk about it, let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I have separate rooms, and that I would fling myself out of the window sooner than consent to any other manner of life. I suffered agonies when I had to confess to my girlish extravagance, my debts for jewelry and trifles (for our poor father had never refused us anything, and spoiled us), but at last I found courage to tell him about them. After all, I had a fortune of my own. Nucingen flew into a rage; he said that I should be the ruin of him, and used frightful language! I wished myself a hundred feet down in the earth. He had my dowry, so he paid my debts, but he stipulated at the same time that my expenses in future must not exceed a certain fixed sum, and I gave way for the sake of peace. And then," she went on, "I wanted to gratify the self-love of some one whom you know. He may have deceived me, but I should do him the justice to say that there was nothing petty in his character. But, after all, he threw me over disgracefully. If, at a woman's utmost need, SOMEBODY heaps gold upon her, he ought never to forsake her; that love should last for ever! But you, at one-and-twenty, you, the soul of honor, with the unsullied conscience of youth, will ask me how a woman can bring herself to accept money in such a way? MON DIEU! is it not natural to share everything with the one to whom we owe our happiness? When all has been given, why should we pause and hesitate over a part? Money is as nothing between us until the moment when the sentiment that bound us together ceases to exist. Were we not bound to each other for life? Who that believes in love foresees such an end to love? You swear to love us eternally; how, then, can our interests be separate?

　　"You do not know how I suffered to-day when Nucingen refused to give me six thousand francs; he spends as much as that every month on his mistress, an opera dancer! I thought of killing myself. The wildest thoughts came into my head. There have been moments in my life when I have envied my servants, and would have changed places with my maid. It was madness to think of going to our father, Anastasie and I have bled him dry; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have raised six thousand francs that way. I should have driven him frantic to no purpose. You have saved me from shame and death; I was beside myself with anguish. Ah! monsieur, I owed you this explanation after my mad ravings. When you left me just now, as soon as you were out of sight, I longed to escape, to run away . . . where, I did not know. Half the women in Paris lead such lives as mine; they live in apparent luxury, and in their souls are tormented by anxiety. I know of poor creatures even more miserable than I; there are women who are driven to ask their tradespeople to make out false bills, women who rob their husbands. Some men believe that an Indian shawl worth a thousand louis only cost five hundred francs, others that a shawl costing five hundred francs is worth a hundred louis. There are women, too, with narrow incomes, who scrape and save and starve their children to pay for a dress. I am innocent of these base meannesses. But this is the last extremity of my torture. Some women will sell themselves to their husbands, and so obtain their way, but I, at any rate, am free. If I chose, Nucingen would cover me with gold, but I would rather weep on the breast of a man whom I can respect. Ah! tonight, M. de Marsay will no longer have a right to think of me as a woman whom he has paid." She tried to conceal her tears from him, hiding her face in her hands; Eugene drew them away and looked at her; she seemed to him sublime at that moment.

　　"It is hideous, is it not," she cried, "to speak in a breath of money and affection. You cannot love me after this," she added.

　　The incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great, and the errors in conduct which are forced upon them by the constitution of society, had thrown Eugene's thoughts into confusion; he uttered soothing and consoling words, and wondered at the beautiful woman before him, and at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain.

　　"You will not remember this against me?" she asked; "promise me that you will not."

　　"Ah! madame, I am incapable of doing so," he said. She took his hand and held it to her heart, a movement full of grace that expressed her deep gratitude.

　　"I am free and happy once more, thanks to you," she said. "Oh! I have felt lately as if I were in the grasp of an iron hand. But after this I mean to live simply and to spend nothing. You will think me just as pretty, will you not, my friend? Keep this," she went on, as she took only six of the banknotes. "In conscience I owe you a thousand crowns, for I really ought to go halves with you."

　　Eugene's maiden conscience resisted; but when the Baroness said, "I am bound to look on you as an accomplice or as an enemy," he took the money.

　　"It shall be a last stake in reserve," he said, "in case of misfortune."

　　"That was what I was dreading to hear," she cried, turning pale. "Oh, if you would that I should be anything to you, swear to me that you will never re-enter a gaming-house. Great Heaven! that I should corrupt you! I should die of sorrow!"

　　They had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time. The contrast between the ostentation of wealth in the house, and the wretched condition of its mistress, dazed the student; and Vautrin's cynical words began to ring in his ears.

　　"Seat yourself there," said the Baroness, pointing to a low chair beside the fire. "I have a difficult letter to write," she added. "Tell me what to say."

　　"Say nothing," Eugene answered her. "Put the bills in an envelope, direct it, and send it by your maid."

　　"Why, you are a love of a man," she said. "Ah! see what it is to have been well brought up. That is the Beauseant through and through," she went on, smiling at him.

　　"She is charming," thought Eugene, more and more in love. He looked round him at the room; there was an ostentatious character about the luxury, a meretricious taste in the splendor.

　　"Do you like it?" she asked, as she rang for the maid.

　　"Therese, take this to M. de Marsay, and give it into his hands yourself. If he is not at home, bring the letter back to me."

　　Therese went, but not before she had given Eugene a spiteful glance.

　　Dinner was announced. Rastignac gave his arm to Mme. de Nucingen, she led the way into a pretty dining-room, and again he saw the luxury of the table which he had admired in his cousin's house.

　　"Come and dine with me on opera evenings, and we will go to the Italiens afterwards," she said.

　　"I should soon grow used to the pleasant life if it could last, but I am a poor student, and I have my way to make."

　　"Oh! you will succeed," she said laughing. "You will see. All that you wish will come to pass. _I_ did not expect to be so happy."

　　It is the wont of women to prove the impossible by the possible, and to annihilate facts by presentiments. When Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac took their places in her box at the Bouffons, her face wore a look of happiness that made her so lovely that every one indulged in those small slanders against which women are defenceless; for the scandal that is uttered lightly is often seriously believed. Those who know Paris, believe nothing that is said, and say nothing of what is done there.

　　Eugene took the Baroness' hand in his, and by some light pressure of the fingers, or a closer grasp of the hand, they found a language in which to express the sensations which the music gave them. It was an evening of intoxicating delight for both; and when it ended, and they went out together, Mme. de Nucingen insisted on taking Eugene with her as far as the Pont Neuf, he disputing with her the whole of the way for a single kiss after all those that she had showered upon him so passionately at the Palais-Royal; Eugene reproached her with inconsistency.

　　"That was gratitude," she said, "for devotion that I did not dare to hope for, but now it would be a promise."

　　"And will you give me no promise, ingrate?"

　　He grew vexed. Then, with one of those impatient gestures that fill a lover with ecstasy, she gave him her hand to kiss, and he took it with a discontented air that delighted her.

　　"I shall see you at the ball on Monday," she said.

　　As Eugene went home in the moonlight, he fell to serious reflections. He was satisfied, and yet dissatisfied. He was pleased with an adventure which would probably give him his desire, for in the end one of the prettiest and best-dressed women in Paris would be his; but, as a set-off, he saw his hopes of fortune brought to nothing; and as soon as he realized this fact, the vague thoughts of yesterday evening began to take a more decided shape in his mind. A check is sure to reveal to us the strength of our hopes. The more Eugene learned of the pleasures of life in Paris, the more impatient he felt of poverty and obscurity. He crumpled the banknote in his pocket, and found any quantity of plausible excuses for appropriating it.

　　He reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve at last, and from the stairhead he saw a light in Goriot's room; the old man had lighted a candle, and set the door ajar, lest the student should pass him by, and go to his room without "telling him all about his daughter," to use his own expression. Eugene, accordingly, told him everything without reserve.

　　"Then they think that I am ruined!" cried Father Goriot, in an agony of jealousy and desperation. "Why, I have still thirteen hundred livres a year! MON DIEU! Poor little girl! why did she not come to me? I would have sold my rentes; she should have had some of the principal, and I would have bought a life-annuity with the rest. My good neighbor, why did not YOU come to tell me of her difficulty? How had you the heart to go and risk her poor little hundred francs at play? This is heart-breaking work. You see what it is to have sons-in-law. Oh! if I had hold of them, I would wring their necks. MON DIEU! CRYING! Did you say she was crying?"

　　"With her head on my waistcoat," said Eugene.

　　"Oh! give it to me," said Father Goriot. "What! my daughter's tears have fallen there--my darling Delphine, who never used to cry when she was a little girl! Oh! I will buy you another; do not wear it again; let me have it. By the terms of her marriage- contract, she ought to have the use of her property. To-morrow morning I will go and see Derville; he is an attorney. I will demand that her money should be invested in her own name. I know the law. I am an old wolf, I will show my teeth."

　　"Here, father; this is a banknote for a thousand francs that she wanted me to keep out of our winnings. Keep them for her, in the pocket of the waistcoat."

　　Goriot looked hard at Eugene, reached out and took the law student's hand, and Eugene felt a tear fall on it.

　　"You will succeed," the old man said. "God is just, you see. I know an honest man when I see him, and I can tell you, there are not many men like you. I am to have another dear child in you, am I? There, go to sleep; you can sleep; you are not yet a father. She was crying! and I have to be told about it!--and I was quietly eating my dinner, like an idiot, all the time--I, who would sell the Father, Son and Holy Ghost to save one tear to either of them."

　　"An honest man!" said Eugene to himself as he lay down. "Upon my word, I think I will be an honest man all my life; it is so pleasant to obey the voice of conscience." Perhaps none but believers in God do good in secret; and Eugene believed in a God.

　　The next day Rastignac went at the appointed time to Mme. de Beauseant, who took him with her to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball. The Marechale received Eugene most graciously. Mme. de Nucingen was there. Delphine's dress seemed to suggest that she wished for the admiration of others, so that she might shine the more in Eugene's eyes; she was eagerly expecting a glance from him, hiding, as she thought, this eagerness from all beholders. This moment is full of charm for one who can guess all that passes in a woman's mind. Who has not refrained from giving his opinion, to prolong her suspense, concealing his pleasure from a desire to tantalize, seeking a confession of love in her uneasiness, enjoying the fears that he can dissipate by a smile? In the course of the evening the law student suddenly comprehended his position; he saw that, as the cousin of Mme. de Beauseant, he was a personage in this world. He was already credited with the conquest of Mme. de Nucingen, and for this reason was a conspicuous figure; he caught the envious glances of other young men, and experienced the earliest pleasures of coxcombry. People wondered at his luck, and scraps of these conversations came to his ears as he went from room to room; all the women prophesied his success; and Delphine, in her dread of losing him, promised that this evening she would not refuse the kiss that all his entreaties could scarcely win yesterday.

　　Rastignac received several invitations. His cousin presented him to other women who were present; women who could claim to be of the highest fashion; whose houses were looked upon as pleasant; and this was the loftiest and most fashionable society in Paris into which he was launched. So this evening had all the charm of a brilliant debut; it was an evening that he was to remember even in old age, as a woman looks back upon her first ball and the memories of her girlish triumphs.

　　The next morning, at breakfast, he related the story of his success for the benefit of Father Goriot and the lodgers. Vautrin began to smile in a diabolical fashion.

　　"And do you suppose," cried that cold-blooded logician, "that a young man of fashion can live here in the Rue Neuve-Sainte- Genevieve, in the Maison Vauquer--an exceedingly respectable boarding-house in every way, I grant you, but an establishment that, none the less, falls short of being fashionable? The house is comfortable, it is lordly in its abundance; it is proud to be the temporary abode of a Rastignac; but, after all, it is in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and luxury would be out of place here, where we only aim at the purely patriarchalorama. If you mean to cut a figure in Paris, my young friend," Vautrin continued, with half-paternal jocularity, "you must have three horses, a tilbury for the mornings, and a closed carriage for the evening; you should spend altogether about nine thousand francs on your stables. You would show yourself unworthy of your destiny if you spent no more than three thousand francs with your tailor, six hundred in perfumery, a hundred crowns to your shoemaker, and a hundred more to your hatter. As for your laundress, there goes another thousand francs; a young man of fashion must of necessity make a great point of his linen; if your linen comes up to the required standard, people often do not look any further. Love and the Church demand a fair altar-cloth. That is fourteen thousand francs. I am saying nothing of losses at play, bets, and presents; it is impossible to allow less than two thousand francs for pocket money. I have led that sort of life, and I know all about these expenses. Add the cost of necessaries next; three hundred louis for provender, a thousand francs for a place to roost in. Well, my boy, for all these little wants of ours we had need to have twenty-five thousand francs every year in our purse, or we shall find ourselves in the kennel, and people laughing at us, and our career is cut short, good-bye to success, and good- bye to your mistress! I am forgetting your valet and your groom! Is Christophe going to carry your billets-doux for you? Do you mean to employ the stationery you use at present? Suicidal policy! Hearken to the wisdom of your elders!" he went on, his bass voice growing louder at each syllable. "Either take up your quarters in a garret, live virtuously, and wed your work, or set about the thing in a different way."

　　Vautrin winked and leered in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer to enforce his remarks by a look which recalled the late tempting proposals by which he had sought to corrupt the student's mind.

　　Several days went by, and Rastignac lived in a whirl of gaiety. He dined almost every day with Mme. de Nucingen, and went wherever she went, only returning to the Rue Neuve-Sainte- Genevieve in the small hours. He rose at mid-day, and dressed to go into the Bois with Delphine if the day was fine, squandering in this way time that was worth far more than he knew. He turned as eagerly to learn the lessons of luxury, and was as quick to feel its fascination, as the flowers of the date palm to receive the fertilizing pollen. He played high, lost and won large sums of money, and at last became accustomed to the extravagant life that young men lead in Paris. He sent fifteen hundred francs out of his first winnings to his mother and sisters, sending handsome presents as well as the money. He had given out that he meant to leave the Maison Vauquer; but January came and went, and he was still there, still unprepared to go.

　　One rule holds good of most young men--whether rich or poor. They never have money for the necessaries of life, but they have always money to spare for their caprices--an anomaly which finds its explanation in their youth and in the almost frantic eagerness with which youth grasps at pleasure. They are reckless with anything obtained on credit, while everything for which they must pay in ready money is made to last as long as possible; if they cannot have all that they want, they make up for it, it would seem, by squandering what they have. To state the matter simply--a student is far more careful of his hat than of his coat, because the latter being a comparatively costly article of dress, it is in the nature of things that a tailor should be a creditor; but it is otherwise with the hatter; the sums of money spent with him are so modest, that he is the most independent and unmanageable of his tribe, and it is almost impossible to bring him to terms. The young man in the balcony of a theatre who displays a gorgeous waistcoat for the benefit of the fair owners of opera glasses, has very probably no socks in his wardrobe, for the hosier is another of the genus of weevils that nibble at the purse. This was Rastignac's condition. His purse was always empty for Mme. Vauquer, always full at the demand of vanity; there was a periodical ebb and flow in his fortunes, which was seldom favorable to the payment of just debts. If he was to leave that unsavory and mean abode, where from time to time his pretensions met with humiliation, the first step was to pay his hostess for a month's board and lodging, and the second to purchase furniture worthy of the new lodgings he must take in his quality of dandy, a course that remained impossible. Rastignac, out of his winnings at cards, would pay his jeweler exorbitant prices for gold watches and chains, and then, to meet the exigencies of play, would carry them to the pawnbroker, that discreet and forbidding- looking friend of youth; but when it was a question of paying for board or lodging, or for the necessary implements for the cultivation of his Elysian fields, his imagination and pluck alike deserted him. There was no inspiration to be found in vulgar necessity, in debts contracted for past requirements. Like most of those who trust to their luck, he put off till the last moment the payment of debts that among the bourgeoisie are regarded as sacred engagements, acting on the plan of Mirabeau, who never settled his baker's bill until it underwent a formidable transformation into a bill of exchange.

　　It was about this time when Rastignac was down on his luck and fell into debt, that it became clear to the law student's mind that he must have some more certain source of income if he meant to live as he had been doing. But while he groaned over the thorny problems of his precarious situation, he felt that he could not bring himself to renounce the pleasures of this extravagant life, and decided that he must continue it at all costs. His dreams of obtaining a fortune appeared more and more chimerical, and the real obstacles grew more formidable. His initiation into the secrets of the Nucingen household had revealed to him that if he were to attempt to use this love affair as a means of mending his fortunes, he must swallow down all sense of decency, and renounce all the generous ideas which redeem the sins of youth. He had chosen this life of apparent splendor, but secretly gnawed by the canker worm of remorse, a life of fleeting pleasure dearly paid for by persistent pain; like Le Distrait of La Bruyere, he had descended so far as to make his bed in a ditch; but (also like Le Distrait) he himself was uncontaminated as yet by the mire that stained his garments.

　　"So we have killed our mandarin, have we?" said Bianchon one day as they left the dinner table.

　　"Not yet," he answered, "but he is at his last gasp."

　　The medical student took this for a joke, but it was not a jest. Eugene had dined in the house that night for the first time for a long while, and had looked thoughtful during the meal. He had taken his place beside Mlle. Taillefer, and stayed through the dessert, giving his neighbor an expressive glance from time to time. A few of the boarders discussed the walnuts at the table, and others walked about the room, still taking part in the conversation which had begun among them. People usually went when they chose; the amount of time that they lingered being determined by the amount of interest that the conversation possessed for them, or by the difficulty of the process of digestion. In winter-time the room was seldom empty before eight o'clock, when the four women had it all to themselves, and made up for the silence previously imposed upon them by the preponderating masculine element. This evening Vautrin had noticed Eugene's abstractedness, and stayed in the room, though he had seemed to be in a hurry to finish his dinner and go. All through the talk afterwards he had kept out of the sight of the law student, who quite believed that Vautrin had left the room. He now took up his position cunningly in the sitting-room instead of going when the last boarders went. He had fathomed the young man's thoughts, and felt that a crisis was at hand. Rastignac was, in fact, in a dilemma, which many another young man must have known.

　　Mme. de Nucingen might love him, or might merely be playing with him, but in either case Rastignac had been made to experience all the alternations of hope and despair of genuine passion, and all the diplomatic arts of a Parisienne had been employed on him. After compromising herself by continually appearing in public with Mme. de Beauseant's cousin she still hesitated, and would not give him the lover's privileges which he appeared to enjoy. For a whole month she had so wrought on his senses, that at last she had made an impression on his heart. If in the earliest days the student had fancied himself to be master, Mme. de Nucingen had since become the stronger of the two, for she had skilfully roused and played upon every instinct, good or bad, in the two or three men comprised in a young student in Paris. This was not the result of deep design on her part, nor was she playing a part, for women are in a manner true to themselves even through their grossest deceit, because their actions are prompted by a natural impulse. It may have been that Delphine, who had allowed this young man to gain such an ascendency over her, conscious that she had been too demonstrative, was obeying a sentiment of dignity, and either repented of her concessions, or it pleased her to suspend them. It is so natural to a Parisienne, even when passion has almost mastered her, to hesitate and pause before taking the plunge; to probe the heart of him to whom she intrusts her future. And once already Mme. de Nucingen's hopes had been betrayed, and her loyalty to a selfish young lover had been despised. She had good reason to be suspicious. Or it may have been that something in Eugene's manner (for his rapid success was making a coxcomb of him) had warned her that the grotesque nature of their position had lowered her somewhat in his eyes. She doubtless wished to assert her dignity; he was young, and she would be great in his eyes; for the lover who had forsaken her had held her so cheap that she was determined that Eugene should not think her an easy conquest, and for this very reason--he knew that de Marsay had been his predecessor. Finally, after the degradation of submission to the pleasure of a heartless young rake, it was so sweet to her to wander in the flower-strewn realms of love, that it was not wonderful that she should wish to dwell a while on the prospect, to tremble with the vibrations of love, to feel the freshness of the breath of its dawn. The true lover was suffering for the sins of the false. This inconsistency is unfortunately only to be expected so long as men do not know how many flowers are mown down in a young woman's soul by the first stroke of treachery.

　　Whatever her reasons may have been, Delphine was playing with Rastignac, and took pleasure in playing with him, doubtless because she felt sure of his love, and confident that she could put an end to the torture as soon as it was her royal pleasure to do so. Eugene's self-love was engaged; he could not suffer his first passage of love to end in a defeat, and persisted in his suit like a sportsman determined to bring down at least one partridge to celebrate his first Feast of Saint-Hubert. The pressure of anxiety, his wounded self-love, his despair, real or feigned, drew him nearer and nearer to this woman. All Paris credited him with this conquest, and yet he was conscious that he had made no progress since the day when he saw Mme. de Nucingen for the first time. He did not know as yet that a woman's coquetry is sometimes more delightful than the pleasure of secure possession of her love, and was possessed with helpless rage. If, at this time, while she denied herself to love, Eugene gathered the springtide spoils of his life, the fruit, somewhat sharp and green, and dearly bought, was no less delicious to the taste. There were moments when he had not a sou in his pockets, and at such times he thought in spite of his conscience of Vautrin's offer and the possibility of fortune by a marriage with Mlle. Taillefer. Poverty would clamor so loudly that more than once he was on the point of yielding to the cunning temptations of the terrible sphinx, whose glance had so often exerted a strange spell over him.

　　Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau went up to their rooms; and Rastignac, thinking that he was alone with the women in the dining-room, sat between Mme. Vauquer and Mme. Couture, who was nodding over the woolen cuffs that she was knitting by the stove, and looked at Mlle. Taillefer so tenderly that she lowered her eyes.

　　"Can you be in trouble, M. Eugene?" Victorine said after a pause.

　　"Who has not his troubles?" answered Rastignac. "If we men were sure of being loved, sure of a devotion which would be our reward for the sacrifices which we are always ready to make, then perhaps we should have no troubles."

　　For answer Mlle. Taillefer only gave him a glance but it was impossible to mistake its meaning.

　　"You, for instance, mademoiselle; you feel sure of your heart to- day, but are you sure that it will never change?"

　　A smile flitted over the poor girl's lips; it seemed as if a ray of light from her soul had lighted up her face. Eugene was dismayed at the sudden explosion of feeling caused by his words.

　　"Ah! but suppose," he said, "that you should be rich and happy to-morrow, suppose that a vast fortune dropped down from the clouds for you, would you still love the man whom you loved in your days of poverty?"

　　A charming movement of the head was her only answer.

　　"Even if he were very poor?"

　　Again the same mute answer.

　　"What nonsense are you talking, you two?" exclaimed Mme. Vauquer.

　　"Never mind," answered Eugene; "we understand each other."

　　"So there is to be an engagement of marriage between M. le Chevalier Eugene de Rastignac and Mlle. Victorine Taillefer, is there?" The words were uttered in Vautrin's deep voice, and Vautrin appeared at the door as he spoke.

　　"Oh! how you startled me!" Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exclaimed together.

　　"I might make a worse choice," said Rastignac, laughing. Vautrin's voice had thrown him into the most painful agitation that he had yet known.

　　"No bad jokes, gentlemen!" said Mme. Couture. "My dear, let us go upstairs."

　　Mme. Vauquer followed the two ladies, meaning to pass the evening in their room, an arrangement that economized fire and candlelight. Eugene and Vautrin were left alone.

　　"I felt sure you would come round to it," said the elder man with the coolness that nothing seemed to shake. "But stay a moment! I have as much delicacy as anybody else. Don't make up your mind on the spur of the moment; you are a little thrown off your balance just now. You are in debt, and I want you to come over to my way of thinking after sober reflection, and not in a fit of passion or desperation. Perhaps you want a thousand crowns. There, you can have them if you like."

　　The tempter took out a pocketbook, and drew thence three banknotes, which he fluttered before the student's eyes. Eugene was in a most painful dilemma. He had debts, debts of honor. He owed a hundred louis to the Marquis d'Ajuda and to the Count de Trailles; he had not the money, and for this reason had not dared to go to Mme. de Restaud's house, where he was expected that evening. It was one of those informal gatherings where tea and little cakes are handed round, but where it is possible to lose six thousand francs at whist in the course of a night.

　　"You must see," said Eugene, struggling to hide a convulsive tremor, "that after what has passed between us, I cannot possibly lay myself under any obligation to you."

　　"Quite right; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise," answered the tempter. "You are a fine young fellow, honorable, brave as a lion, and as gentle as a young girl. You would be a fine haul for the devil! I like youngsters of your sort. Get rid of one or two more prejudices, and you will see the world as it is. Make a little scene now and then, and act a virtuous part in it, and a man with a head on his shoulders can do exactly as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in the gallery. Ah! a few days yet, and you will be with us; and if you would only be tutored by me, I would put you in the way of achieving all your ambitions. You should no sooner form a wish than it should be realized to the full; you should have all your desires--honors, wealth, or women. Civilization should flow with milk and honey for you. You should be our pet and favorite, our Benjamin. We would all work ourselves to death for you with pleasure; every obstacle should be removed from your path. You have a few prejudices left; so you think that I am a scoundrel, do you? Well, M. de Turenne, quite as honorable a man as you take yourself to be, had some little private transactions with bandits, and did not feel that his honor was tarnished. You would rather not lie under any obligation to me, eh? You need not draw back on that account," Vautrin went on, and a smile stole over his lips. "Take these bits of paper and write across this," he added, producing a piece of stamped paper, "Accepted the sum of three thousand five hundred francs due this day twelvemonth, and fill in the date. The rate of interest is stiff enough to silence any scruples on your part; it gives you the right to call me a Jew. You can call quits with me on the score of gratitude. I am quite willing that you should despise me to-day, because I am sure that you will have a kindlier feeling towards me later on. You will find out fathomless depths in my nature, enormous and concentrated forces that weaklings call vices, but you will never find me base or ungrateful. In short, I am neither a pawn nor a bishop, but a castle, a tower of strength, my boy."

　　"What manner of man are you?" cried Eugene. "Were you created to torment me?"

　　"Why no; I am a good-natured fellow, who is willing to do a dirty piece of work to put you high and dry above the mire for the rest of your days. Do you ask the reason of this devotion? All right; I will tell you that some of these days. A word or two in your ear will explain it. I have begun by shocking you, by showing you the way to ring the changes, and giving you a sight of the mechanism of the social machine; but your first fright will go off like a conscript's terror on the battlefield. You will grow used to regarding men as common soldiers who have made up their minds to lose their lives for some self-constituted king. Times have altered strangely. Once you could say to a bravo, 'Here are a hundred crowns; go and kill Monsieur So-and-so for me,' and you could sup quietly after turning some one off into the dark for the least thing in the world. But nowadays I propose to put you in the way of a handsome fortune; you have only to nod your head, it won't compromise you in any way, and you hesitate. 'Tis an effeminate age."

　　Eugene accepted the draft, and received the banknotes in exchange for it.

　　"Well, well. Come, now, let us talk rationally," Vautrin continued. "I mean to leave this country in a few months' time for America, and set about planting tobacco. I will send you the cigars of friendship. If I make money at it, I will help you in your career. If I have no children--which will probably be the case, for I have no anxiety to raise slips of myself here--you shall inherit my fortune. That is what you may call standing by a man; but I myself have a liking for you. I have a mania, too, for devoting myself to some one else. I have done it before. You see, my boy, I live in a loftier sphere than other men do; I look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look at. What is a man's life to me? Not THAT," he said, and he snapped his thumb-nail against his teeth. "A man, in short, is everything to me, or just nothing at all. Less than nothing if his name happens to be Poiret; you can crush him like a bug, he is flat and he is offensive. But a man is a god when he is like you; he is not a machine covered with a skin, but a theatre in which the greatest sentiments are displayed--great thoughts and feelings--and for these, and these only, I live. A sentiment-- what is that but the whole world in a thought? Look at Father Goriot. For him, his two girls are the whole universe; they are the clue by which he finds his way through creation. Well, for my own part, I have fathomed the depths of life, there is only one real sentiment--comradeship between man and man. Pierre and Jaffier, that is my passion. I knew Venice Preserved by heart. Have you met many men plucky enough when a comrade says, 'Let us bury a dead body!' to go and do it without a word or plaguing him by taking a high moral tone? I have done it myself. I should not talk like this to just everybody, but you are not like an ordinary man; one can talk to you, you can understand things. You will not dabble about much longer among the tadpoles in these swamps. Well, then, it is all settled. You will marry. Both of us carry our point. Mine is made of iron, and will never soften, he! he!"

　　Vautrin went out. He would not wait to hear the student's repudiation, he wished to put Eugene at his ease. He seemed to understand the secret springs of the faint resistance still made by the younger man; the struggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by justifying their blameworthy actions to themselves.

　　"He may do as he likes; I shall not marry Mlle. Taillefer, that is certain," said Eugene to himself.

　　He regarded this man with abhorrence, and yet the very cynicism of Vautrin's ideas, and the audacious way in which he used other men for his own ends, raised him in the student's eyes; but the thought of a compact threw Eugene into a fever of apprehension, and not until he had recovered somewhat did he dress, call for a cab, and go to Mme. de Restaud's.

　　For some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young man whose every step seemed a triumphal progress in the great world; it seemed to her that he might be a formidable power before long. He paid Messieurs de Trailles and d'Ajuda, played at whist for part of the evening, and made good his losses. Most men who have their way to make are more or less of fatalists, and Eugene was superstitious; he chose to consider that his luck was heaven's reward for his perseverance in the right way. As soon as possible on the following morning he asked Vautrin whether the bill he had given was still in the other's possession; and on receiving a reply in the affirmative, he repaid the three thousand francs with a not unnatural relief.

　　"Everything is going on well," said Vautrin.

　　"But I am not your accomplice," said Eugene.

　　"I know, I know," Vautrin broke in. "You are still acting like a child. You are making mountains out of molehills at the outset."

　　Two days later, Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau were sitting together on a bench in the sun. They had chosen a little frequented alley in the Jardin des Plantes, and a gentleman was chatting with them, the same person, as a matter of fact, about whom the medical student had, not without good reason, his own suspicions.

　　"Mademoiselle," this M. Gondureau was saying, "I do not see any cause for your scruples. His Excellency, Monseigneur the Minister of Police----"

　　"Yes, his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter," said Gondureau.

　　Who would think it probable that Poiret, a retired clerk, doubtless possessed of some notions of civic virtue, though there might be nothing else in his head--who would think it likely that such a man would continue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman of the Rue de Buffon, when the latter dropped the mask of a decent citizen by that word "police," and gave a glimpse of the features of a detective from the Rue de Jerusalem? And yet nothing was more natural. Perhaps the following remarks from the hitherto unpublished records made by certain observers will throw a light on the particular species to which Poiret belonged in the great family of fools. There is a race of quill-drivers, confined in the columns of the budget between the first degree of latitude (a kind of administrative Greenland where the salaries begin at twelve hundred francs) to the third degree, a more temperate zone, where incomes grow from three to six thousand francs, a climate where the BONUS flourishes like a half-hardy annual in spite of some difficulties of culture. A characteristic trait that best reveals the feeble narrow-mindedness of these inhabitants of petty officialdom is a kind of involuntary, mechanical, and instinctive reverence for the Grand Lama of every Ministry, known to the rank and file only by his signature (an illegible scrawl) and by his title--"His Excellency Monseigneur le Ministre," five words which produce as much effect as the il Bondo Cani of the Calife de Bagdad, five words which in the eyes of this low order of intelligence represent a sacred power from which there is no appeal. The Minister is administratively infallible for the clerks in the employ of the Government, as the Pope is infallible for good Catholics. Something of this peculiar radiance invests everything he does or says, or that is said or done in his name; the robe of office covers everything and legalizes everything done by his orders; does not his very title--His Excellency--vouch for the purity of his intentions and the righteousness of his will, and serve as a sort of passport and introduction to ideas that otherwise would not be entertained for a moment? Pronounce the words "His Excellency," and these poor folk will forthwith proceed to do what they would not do for their own interests. Passive obedience is as well known in a Government department as in the army itself; and the administrative system silences consciences, annihilates the individual, and ends (give it time enough) by fashioning a man into a vise or a thumbscrew, and he becomes part of the machinery of Government. Wherefore, M. Gondureau, who seemed to know something of human nature, recognized Poiret at once as one of those dupes of officialdom, and brought out for his benefit, at the proper moment, the deus ex machina, the magical words "His Excellency," so as to dazzle Poiret just as he himself unmasked his batteries, for he took Poiret and the Michonneau for the male and female of the same species.

　　"If his Excellency himself, his Excellency the Minister . . . Ah! that is quite another thing," said Poiret.

　　"You seem to be guided by this gentleman's opinion, and you hear what he says," said the man of independent means, addressing Mlle. Michonneau. "Very well, his Excellency is at this moment absolutely certain that the so-called Vautrin, who lodges at the Maison Vauquer, is a convict who escaped from penal servitude at Toulon, where he is known by the nickname Trompe-la-Mort."

　　"Trompe-la-Mort?" said Pioret. "Dear me, he is very lucky if he deserves that nickname."

　　"Well, yes," said the detective. "They call him so because he has been so lucky as not to lose his life in the very risky businesses that he has carried through. He is a dangerous man, you see! He has qualities that are out of the common; the thing he is wanted for, in fact, was a matter which gained him no end of credit with his own set----"

　　"Then is he a man of honor?" asked Poiret.

　　"Yes, according to his notions. He agreed to take another man's crime upon himself--a forgery committed by a very handsome young fellow that he had taken a great fancy to, a young Italian, a bit of a gambler, who has since gone into the army, where his conduct has been unexceptionable."

　　"But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, why should he want me?" asked Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"Oh yes," said Poiret, "if the Minister, as you have been so obliging as to tell us, really knows for a certainty----"

　　"Certainty is not the word; he only suspects. You will soon understand how things are. Jacques Collin, nicknamed Trompe-la- Mort, is in the confidence of every convict in the three prisons; he is their man of business and their banker. He makes a very good thing out of managing their affairs, which want a MAN OF MARK to see about them."

　　"Ha! ha! do you see the pun, mademoiselle?" asked Poiret. "This gentleman calls himself a MAN OF MARK because he is a MARKED MAN-- branded, you know."

　　"This so-called Vautrin," said the detective, "receives the money belonging to my lords the convicts, invests it for them, and holds it at the disposal of those who escape, or hands it over to their families if they leave a will, or to their mistresses when they draw upon him for their benefit."

　　"Their mistresses! You mean their wives," remarked Poiret.

　　"No, sir. A convict's wife is usually an illegitimate connection. We call them concubines."

　　"Then they all live in a state of concubinage?"

　　"Naturally."

　　"Why, these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow. Since you have the honor of seeing his Excellency, you, who seem to have philanthropic ideas, ought really to enlighten him as to their immoral conduct--they are setting a shocking example to the rest of society."

　　"But the Government does not hold them up as models of all the virtues, my dear sir----"

　　"Of course not, sir; but still----"

　　"Just let the gentleman say what he has to say, dearie," said Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"You see how it is, mademoiselle," Gondureau continued. "The Government may have the strongest reasons for getting this illicit hoard into its hands; it mounts up to something considerable, by all that we can make out. Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his friends the convicts, but he has other amounts which are paid over to him by the Society of the Ten Thousand----"

　　"Ten Thousand Thieves!" cried Pioret in alarm.

　　"No. The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty offenders, but of people who set about their work on a large scale--they won't touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in it. It is composed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent straight to the Assize Courts when they come up for trial. They know the Code too well to risk their necks when they are nabbed. Collin is their confidential agent and legal adviser. By means of the large sums of money at his disposal he has established a sort of detective system of his own; it is widespread and mysterious in its workings. We have had spies all about him for a twelvemonth, and yet we could not manage to fathom his games. His capital and his cleverness are at the service of vice and crime; this money furnishes the necessary funds for a regular army of blackguards in his pay who wage incessant war against society. If we can catch Trompe-la-Mort, and take possession of his funds, we should strike at the root of this evil. So this job is a kind of Government affair--a State secret--and likely to redound to the honor of those who bring the thing to a successful conclusion. You, sir, for instance, might very well be taken into a Government department again; they might make you secretary to a Commissary of Police; you could accept that post without prejudice to your retiring pension."

　　Mlle. Michonneau interposed at this point with, "What is there to hinder Trompe-la-Mort from making off with the money?"

　　"Oh!" said the detective, "a man is told off to follow him everywhere he goes, with orders to kill him if he were to rob the convicts. Then it is not quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to run away with a young lady of family. Besides, Collin is not the sort of fellow to play such a trick; he would be disgraced, according to his notions."

　　"You are quite right, sir," said Poiret, "utterly disgraced he would be."

　　"But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him without more ado," remarked Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"Very well, mademoiselle, I will explain--but," he added in her ear, "keep your companion quiet, or I shall never have done. The old boy ought to pay people handsomely for listening to him.-- Trompe-la-Mort, when he came back here," he went on aloud "slipped into the skin of an honest man; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen, and took up his quarters in an unpretending lodging-house. He is cunning, that he is! You don't catch him napping. Then M. Vautrin is a man of consequence, who transacts a good deal of business."

　　"Naturally," said Poiret to himself.

　　"And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of the real Vautrin, he would put every one's back up among the business men in Paris, and public opinion would be against him. M. le Prefet de Police is on slippery ground; he has enemies. They would take advantage of any mistake. There would be a fine outcry and fuss made by the Opposition, and he would be sent packing. We must set about this just as we did about the Coignard affair, the sham Comte de Sainte-Helene; if he had been the real Comte de Sainte-Helene, we should have been in the wrong box. We want to be quite sure what we are about."

　　"Yes, but what you want is a pretty woman," said Mlle. Michonneau briskly.

　　"Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him," said the detective. "I will tell you a secret--he does not like them."

　　"Still, I do not see what I can do, supposing that I did agree to identify him for two thousand francs."

　　"Nothing simpler," said the stranger. "I will send you a little bottle containing a dose that will send a rush of blood to the head; it will do him no harm whatever, but he will fall down as if he were in a fit. The drug can be put into wine or coffee; either will do equally well. You carry your man to bed at once, and undress him to see that he is not dying. As soon as you are alone, you give him a slap on the shoulder, and PRESTO! the letters will appear."

　　"Why, that is just nothing at all," said Poiret.

　　"Well, do you agree?" said Gondureau, addressing the old maid.

　　"But, my dear sir, suppose there are no letters at all," said Mlle. Michonneau; "am I to have the two thousand francs all the same?"

　　"No."

　　"What will you give me then?"

　　"Five hundred francs."

　　"It is such a thing to do for so little! It lies on your conscience just the same, and I must quiet my conscience, sir."

　　"I assure you," said Poiret, "that mademoiselle has a great deal of conscience, and not only so, she is a very amiable person, and very intelligent."

　　"Well, now," Mlle. Michonneau went on, "make it three thousand francs if he is Trompe-la-Mort, and nothing at all if he is an ordinary man."

　　"Done!" said Gondureau, "but on the condition that the thing is settled to-morrow."

　　"Not quite so soon, my dear sir; I must consult my confessor first."

　　"You are a sly one," said the detective as he rose to his feet. "Good-bye till to-morrow, then. And if you should want to see me in a hurry, go to the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the bottom of the Cour de la Sainte-Chapelle. There is one door under the archway. Ask there for M. Gondureau."

　　Bianchon, on his way back from Cuvier's lecture, overheard the sufficiently striking nickname of Trompe-la-Mort, and caught the celebrated chief detective's "Done!"

　　"Why didn't you close with him? It would be three hundred francs a year," said Poiret to Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"Why didn't I?" she asked. "Why, it wants thinking over. Suppose that M. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, perhaps we might do better for ourselves with him. Still, on the other hand, if you ask him for money, it would put him on his guard, and he is just the man to clear out without paying, and that would be an abominable sell."

　　"And suppose you did warn him," Poiret went on, "didn't that gentleman say that he was closely watched? You would spoil everything."

　　"Anyhow," thought Mlle. Michonneau, "I can't abide him. He says nothing but disagreeable things to me."

　　"But you can do better than that," Poiret resumed. "As that gentleman said (and he seemed to me to be a very good sort of man, besides being very well got up), it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid society of a criminal, however virtuous he may be. Once a thief, always a thief. Suppose he were to take it into his head to murder us all? The deuce! We should be guilty of manslaughter, and be the first to fall victims into the bargain!"

　　Mlle. Michonneau's musings did not permit her to listen very closely to the remarks that fell one by one from Poiret's lips like water dripping from a leaky tap. When once this elderly babbler began to talk, he would go on like clockwork unless Mlle. Michonneau stopped him. He started on some subject or other, and wandered on through parenthesis after parenthesis, till he came to regions as remote as possible from his premises without coming to any conclusions by the way.

　　By the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a whole string of examples and quotations more or less irrelevant to the subject in hand, which led him to give a full account of his own deposition in the case of the Sieur Ragoulleau versus Dame Morin, when he had been summoned as a witness for the defence.

　　As they entered the dining-room, Eugene de Rastignac was talking apart with Mlle. Taillefer; the conversation appeared to be of such thrilling interest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers as they passed through the room. None of this was thrown away on Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"I knew how it would end," remarked that lady, addressing Poiret. "They have been making eyes at each other in a heartrending way for a week past."

　　"Yes," he answered. "So she was found guilty."

　　"Who?"

　　"Mme. Morin."

　　"I am talking about Mlle. Victorine," said Mlle, Michonneau, as she entered Poiret's room with an absent air, "and you answer, 'Mme. Morin.' Who may Mme. Morin be?"

　　"What can Mlle. Victorine be guilty of?" demanded Poiret.

　　"Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugene de Rastignac and going further and further without knowing exactly where she is going, poor innocent!"

　　That morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair. In his own mind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and deliberately shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that extraordinary man professed for him, nor would he look to the consequences of such an alliance. Nothing short of a miracle could extricate him now out of the gulf into which he had walked an hour ago, when he exchanged vows in the softest whispers with Mlle. Taillefer. To Victorine it seemed as if she heard an angel's voice, that heaven was opening above her; the Maison Vauquer took strange and wonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. She loved and she was loved; at any rate, she believed that she was loved; and what woman would not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac's face and listening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under the Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer? He had trampled on his conscience; he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately; he had said to himself that a woman's happiness should atone for this venial sin. The energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face; the lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes. Luckily for him, the miracle took place. Vautrin came in in high spirits, and at once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom he had brought together by the combinations of his infernal genius, but his deep voice broke in upon their bliss.

　　"A charming girl is my Fanchette   In her simplicity,"

　　he sang mockingly.

　　Victorine fled. Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it was full of joy, and not of sorrow. Poor child! A pressure of the hand, the light touch of Rastignac's hair against her cheek, a word whispered in her ear so closely that she felt the student's warm breath on her, the pressure of a trembling arm about her waist, a kiss upon her throat--such had been her betrothal. The near neighborhood of the stout Sylvie, who might invade that glorified room at any moment, only made these first tokens of love more ardent, more eloquent, more entrancing than the noblest deeds done for love's sake in the most famous romances. This plain-song of love, to use the pretty expression of our forefathers, seemed almost criminal to the devout young girl who went to confession every fortnight. In that one hour she had poured out more of the treasures of her soul than she could give in later days of wealth and happiness, when her whole self followed the gift.

　　"The thing is arranged," Vautrin said to Eugene, who remained. "Our two dandies have fallen out. Everything was done in proper form. It is a matter of opinion. Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. They will meet to-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. By half- past eight in the morning Mlle. Taillefer, calmly dipping her bread and butter in her coffee cup, will be sole heiress of her father's fortune and affections. A funny way of putting it, isn't it? Taillefer's youngster is an expert swordsman, and quite cocksure about it, but he will be bled; I have just invented a thrust for his benefit, a way of raising your sword point and driving it at the forehead. I must show you that thrust; it is an uncommonly handy thing to know."

　　Rastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in reply. Just then Goriot came in, and Bianchon and a few of the boarders likewise appeared.

　　"That is just as I intended." Vautrin said. "You know quite well what you are about. Good, my little eaglet! You are born to command, you are strong, you stand firm on your feet, you are game! I respect you."

　　He made as though he would take Eugene's hand, but Rastignac hastily withdrew it, sank into a chair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to him that there was a sea of blood before his eyes.

　　"Oh! so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes of virtue about us!" murmured Vautrin. "But Papa Doliban has three millions; I know the amount of his fortune. Once have her dowry in your hands, and your character will be as white as the bride's white dress, even in your own eyes."

　　Rastignac hesitated no longer. He made up his mind that he would go that evening to warn the Taillefers, father and son. But just as Vautrin left him, Father Goriot came up and said in his ear, "You look melancholy, my boy; I will cheer you up. Come with me."

　　The old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he spoke. Eugene went with him, his curiosity had been aroused.

　　"Let us go up to your room," the worthy soul remarked, when he had asked Sylvie for the law student's key. "This morning," he resumed, "you thought that SHE did not care about you, did you not? Eh? She would have nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and out of heart. Stuff and rubbish! She wanted you to go because she was expecting ME! Now do you understand? We were to complete the arrangements for taking some chambers for you, a jewel of a place, you are to move into it in three days' time. Don't split upon me. She wants it to be a surprise; but I couldn't bear to keep the secret from you. You will be in the Rue d'Artois, only a step or two from the Rue Saint-Lazare, and you are to be housed like a prince! Any one might have thought we were furnishing the house for a bride. Oh! we have done a lot of things in the last month, and you knew nothing about it. My attorney has appeared on the scene, and my daughter is to have thirty-six thousand francs a year, the interest on her money, and I shall insist on having her eight hundred thousand invested in sound securities, landed property that won't run away."

　　Eugene was dumb. He folded his arms and paced up and down in his cheerless, untidy room. Father Goriot waited till the student's back was turned, and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney- piece and set upon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac's arms stamped in gold on the leather.

　　"My dear boy," said the kind soul, "I have been up to the eyes in this business. You see, there was plenty of selfishness on my part; I have an interested motive in helping you to change lodgings. You will not refuse me if I ask you something; will you, eh?"

　　"What is it?"

　　"There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to let along with them; that is where I am going to live, isn't that so? I am getting old: I am too far from my girls. I shall not be in the way, but I shall be there, that is all. You will come and talk to me about her every evening. It will not put you about, will it? I shall have gone to bed before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and I shall say to myself, 'He has just seen my little Delphine. He has been to a dance with her, and she is happy, thanks to him.' If I were ill, it would do my heart good to hear you moving about below, to know when you leave the house and when you come in. It is only a step to the Champs- Elysees, where they go every day, so I shall be sure of seeing them, whereas now I am sometimes too late. And then--perhaps she may come to see you! I shall hear her, I shall see her in her soft quilted pelisse tripping about as daintily as a kitten. In this one month she has become my little girl again, so light- hearted and gay. Her soul is recovering, and her happiness is owing to you! Oh! I would do impossibilities for you. Only just now she said to me, 'I am very happy, papa!' When they say 'father' stiffly, it sends a chill through me; but when they call me 'papa,' it brings all the old memories back. I feel most their father then; I even believe that they belong to me, and to no one else."

　　The good man wiped his eyes, he was crying.

　　"It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long, long time since she took my arm as she did to-day. Yes, indeed, it must be quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my girls. How pleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of her gown, the warmth of her arm! Well, I took Delphine everywhere this morning; I went shopping with her, and I brought her home again. Oh! you must let me live near you. You may want some one to do you a service some of these days, and I shall be on the spot to do it. Oh! if only that great dolt of an Alsatian would die, if his gout would have the sense to attack his stomach, how happy my poor child would be! You would be my son-in-law; you would be her husband in the eyes of the world. Bah! she has known no happiness, that excuses everything. Our Father in heaven is surely on the side of fathers on earth who love their children. How fond of you she is!" he said, raising his head after a pause. "All the time we were going about together she chatted away about you. 'He is so nice-looking, papa; isn't he? He is kind-hearted! Does he talk to you about me?' Pshaw! she said enough about you to fill whole volumes; between the Rue d'Artois and the Passage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into mine. I did not feel old once during that delightful morning; I felt as light as a feather. I told her how you had given the banknote to me; it moved my darling to tears. But what can this be on your chimney-piece?" said Father Goriot at last. Rastignac had showed no sign, and he was dying of impatience.

　　Eugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. He thought of Vautrin, of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning, and of this realization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast between the two sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of nightmare. He went to the chimney-piece, saw the little square case, opened it, and found a watch of Breguet's make wrapped in paper, on which these words were written:

　　"I want you to think of me every hour, BECAUSE . . .   "DELPHINE."

　　That last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that had taken place between them. Eugene felt touched. Inside the gold watch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel. The chain, the key, the workmanship and design of the trinket were all such as he had imagined, for he had long coveted such a possession. Father Goriot was radiant. Of course he had promised to tell his daughter every little detail of the scene and of the effect produced upon Eugene by her present; he shared in the pleasure and excitement of the young people, and seemed to be not the least happy of the three. He loved Rastignac already for his own as well as for his daughter's sake.

　　"You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. That great lout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his opera- dancer. Aha! he looked very foolish when my attorney let him know where he was. He says he idolizes my daughter, does he? He had better let her alone, or I will kill him. To think that my Delphine is his"--he heaved a sigh--"it is enough to make me murder him, but it would not be manslaughter to kill that animal; he is a pig with a calf's brains.--You will take me with you, will you not?"

　　"Yes, dear Father Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you----"

　　"Yes, I do know very well. You are not ashamed of me, are you? Not you! Let me embrace you," and he flung his arms around the student's neck.

　　"You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! You will go to her this evening, will you not?"

　　"Oh! yes. I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand."

　　"Can I be of any use?"

　　"My word, yes! Will you go to old Taillefer's while I go to Mme. de Nucingen? Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this evening; it is a matter of life and death."

　　"Really, young man!" cried Father Goriot, with a change of countenance; "are you really paying court to his daughter, as those simpletons were saying down below? . . . TONNERRE DE DIEU! you have no notion what a tap A LA GORIOT is like, and if you are playing a double game, I shall put a stop to it by one blow of the fist. . . Oh! the thing is impossible!"

　　"I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world," said the student. "I only knew it a moment ago."

　　"Oh! what happiness!" cried Goriot.

　　"But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off to- morrow morning, and I have heard it said that he may lose his life in it."

　　"But what business is it of yours?" said Goriot.

　　"Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting in an appearance----"

　　Just at that moment Vautrin's voice broke in upon them; he was standing at the threshold of his door and singing:

　　"Oh! Richard, oh my king!   All the world abandons thee!   Broum! broum! broum! broum! broum!

　　The same old story everywhere,   A roving heart and a . . . tra la la."

　　"Gentlemen!" shouted Christophe, "the soup is ready, and every one is waiting for you."

　　"Here," Vautrin called down to him, "come and take a bottle of my Bordeaux."

　　"Do you think your watch is pretty?" asked Goriot. "She has good taste, hasn't she? Eh?"

　　Vautrin, Father Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and, all three of them being late, were obliged to sit together.

　　Eugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during dinner; but the other, so charming in Mme. Vauquer's opinion, had never been so witty. His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the whole table in good humor. His assurance and coolness filled Eugene with consternation.

　　"Why, what has come to you to-day?" inquired Mme. Vauquer. "You are as merry as a skylark."

　　"I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain."

　　"Bargain?" said Eugene.

　　"Well, yes, bargain. I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall be paid a handsome commission on them--Mlle. Michonneau," he went on, seeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently, "have you any objection to some feature in my face, that you are making those lynx eyes at me? Just let me know, and I will have it changed to oblige you . . . We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I dare say?" he added, winking at the superannuated clerk.

　　"Bless my soul, you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules," said the young painter.

　　"I will, upon my word! if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the Venus of Pere-Lachaise," replied Vautrin.

　　"There's Poiret," suggested Bianchon.

　　"Oh! Poiret shall pose as Poiret. He can be a garden god!" cried Vautrin; "his name means a pear----"

　　"A sleepy pear!" Bianchon put in. "You will come in between the pear and the cheese."

　　"What stuff are you all talking!" said Mme. Vauquer; "you would do better to treat us to your Bordeaux; I see a glimpse of a bottle there. It would keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the stomach besides."

　　"Gentlemen," said Vautrin, "the Lady President calls us to order. Mme. Couture and Mlle. Victorine will take your jokes in good part, but respect the innocence of the aged Goriot. I propose a glass or two of Bordeauxrama, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite, no political allusions intended.--Come, you Turk!" he added, looking at Christophe, who did not offer to stir. "Christophe! Here! What, you don't answer to your own name? Bring us some liquor, Turk!"

　　"Here it is, sir," said Christophe, holding out the bottle.

　　Vautrin filled Eugene's glass and Goriot's likewise, then he deliberately poured out a few drops into his own glass, and sipped it while his two neighbors drank their wine. All at once he made a grimace.

　　"Corked!" he cried. "The devil! You can drink the rest of this, Christophe, and go and find another bottle; take from the right- hand side, you know. There are sixteen of us; take down eight bottles."

　　"If you are going to stand treat," said the painter, "I will pay for a hundred chestnuts."

　　"Oh! oh!"

　　"Booououh!"

　　"Prrr!"

　　These exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a set firework.

　　"Come, now, Mama Vauquer, a couple of bottles of champagne," called Vautrin.

　　"Quien! just like you! Why not ask for the whole house at once. A couple of bottles of champagne; that means twelve francs! I shall never see the money back again, I know! But if M. Eugene has a mind to pay for it, I have some currant cordial."

　　"That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught," muttered the medical student.

　　"Shut up, Bianchon," exclaimed Rastignac; "the very mention of black draught makes me feel----. Yes, champagne, by all means; I will pay for it," he added.

　　"Sylvie," called Mme. Vauquer, "bring in some biscuits, and the little cakes."

　　"Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards," said Vautrin. "But trot out the biscuits."

　　The Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene than ever, and the fun grew fast and furious. Imitations of the cries of various animals mingled with the loud laughter; the Museum official having taken it into his head to mimic a cat-call rather like the caterwauling of the animal in question, eight voices simultaneously struck up with the following variations:

　　"Scissors to grind!"

　　"Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds!"

　　"Brandy-snaps, ladies!"

　　"China to mend!"

　　"Boat ahoy!"

　　"Sticks to beat your wives or your clothes!"

　　"Old clo'!"

　　"Cherries all ripe!"

　　But the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which he rendered the cry of "Umbrellas to me-end!"

　　A few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the room, a storm of tomfoolery, a sort of cats' concert, with Vautrin as conductor of the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on Eugene and Father Goriot. The wine seemed to have gone to their heads already. They leaned back in their chairs, looking at the general confusion with an air of gravity, and drank but little; both of them were absorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that evening, and yet neither of them felt able to rise and go. Vautrin gave a side glance at them from time to time, and watched the change that came over their faces, choosing the moment when their eyes drooped and seemed about to close, to bend over Rastignac and to say in his ear:--

　　"My little lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin yet, and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs. When I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of Providence can put me off. Aha! we were for going round to warn old Taillefer, telling tales out of school! The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded, the bread is ready for the oven; to- morrow we will eat it up and whisk away the crumbs; and we are not going to spoil the baking? . . . No, no, it is all as good as done! We may suffer from a few conscientious scruples, but they will be digested along with the bread. While we are having our forty winks, Colonel Count Franchessini will clear the way to Michel Taillefer's inheritance with the point of his sword. Victorine will come in for her brother's money, a snug fifteen thousand francs a year. I have made inquiries already, and I know that her late mother's property amounts to more than three hundred thousand----"

　　Eugene heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed to be glued to the roof of his mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was creeping over him. He still saw the table and the faces round it, but it was through a bright mist. Soon the noise began to subside, one by one the boarders went. At last, when their numbers had so dwindled that the party consisted of Mme. Vauquer, Mme. Couture, Mlle. Victorine, Vautrin, and Father Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in a dream how Mme. Vauquer busied herself by collecting the bottles, and drained the remainder of the wine out of each to fill others.

　　"Oh! how uproarious they are! what a thing it is to be young!" said the widow.

　　These were the last words that Eugene heard and understood.

　　"There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this," said Sylvie. "There, just hark at Christophe, he is snoring like a top."

　　"Good-bye, mamma," said Vautrin; "I am going to a theatre on the boulevard to see M. Marty in Le Mont Sauvage, a fine play taken from Le Solitaire. . . . If you like, I will take you and these two ladies----"

　　"Thank you; I must decline," said Mme. Couture.

　　"What! my good lady!" cried Mme. Vauquer, "decline to see a play founded on the Le Solitaire, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? We were so fond of that book that we cried over it like Magdalens under the line-trees last summer, and then it is an improving work that might edify your young lady."

　　"We are forbidden to go to the play," answered Victorine.

　　"Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit," said Vautrin, shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way.

　　He altered the sleeping student's position, settled his head more comfortably on the back of his chair, kissed him warmly on the forehead, and began to sing:

　　"Sleep, little darlings;   I watch while you slumber."

　　"I am afraid he may be ill," said Victorine.

　　"Then stop and take care of him," returned Vautrin. " 'Tis your duty as a meek and obedient wife," he whispered in her ear. "the young fellow worships you, and you will be his little wife-- there's your fortune for you. In short," he added aloud, "they lived happily ever afterwards, were much looked up to in all the countryside, and had a numerous family. That is how all the romances end.--Now, mamma," he went on, as he turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her waist, "put on your bonnet, your best flowered silk, and the countess' scarf, while I go out and call a cab--all my own self."

　　And he started out, singing as he went:

　　"Oh! sun! divine sun!   Ripening the pumpkins every one."

　　"My goodness! Well, I'm sure! Mme. Couture, I could live happily in a garret with a man like that.--There, now!" she added, looking round for the old vermicelli maker, "there is that Father Goriot half seas over. HE never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. But he will measure his length somewhere. My word! it is disgraceful to lose his senses like that, at his age! You will be telling me that he couldn't lose what he hadn't got-- Sylvie, just take him up to his room!"

　　Sylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just as he was, like a package, across the bed.

　　"Poor young fellow!" said Mme. Couture, putting back Eugene's hair that had fallen over his eyes; "he is like a young girl, he does not know what dissipation is."

　　"Well, I can tell you this, I know," said Mme. Vauquer, "I have taken lodgers these thirty years, and a good many have passed through my hands, as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more aristocratic looking young man than M. Eugene. How handsome he looks sleeping! Just let his head rest on your shoulder, Mme. Couture. Pshaw! he falls over towards Mlle. Victorine. There's a special providence for young things. A little more, and he would have broken his head against the knob of the chair. They'd make a pretty pair those two would!"

　　"Hush, my good neighbor," cried Mme. Couture, "you are saying such things----"

　　"Pooh!" put in Mme. Vauquer, "he does not hear.--Here, Sylvie! come and help me to dress. I shall put on my best stays."

　　"What! your best stays just after dinner, madame?" said Sylvie. "No, you can get some one else to lace you. I am not going to be your murderer. It's a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life."

　　"I don't care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin."

　　"Are you so fond of your heirs as all that?"

　　"Come, Sylvie, don't argue," said the widow, as she left the room.

　　"At her age, too!" said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her mistress as she spoke.

　　Mme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugene slept on Victorine's shoulder. The sound of Christophe's snoring echoed through the silent house; Eugene's quiet breathing seemed all the quieter by force of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a child. Victorine was very happy; she was free to perform one of those acts of charity which form an innocent outlet for all the overflowing sentiments of a woman's nature; he was so close to her that she could feel the throbbing of his heart; there was a look of almost maternal protection and conscious pride in Victorine's face. Among the countless thoughts that crowded up in her young innocent heart, there was a wild flutter of joy at this close contact.

　　"Poor, dear child!" said Mme. Couture, squeezing her hand.

　　The old lady looked at the girl. Victorine's innocent, pathetic face, so radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her, called to mind some naive work of mediaeval art, when the painter neglected the accessories, reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet, austere outlines and ivory tints of the face, which seems to have caught something of the golden glory of heaven.

　　"After all, he only took two glasses, mamma," said Victorine, passing her fingers through Eugene's hair.

　　"Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have carried his wine like the rest of them. His drowsiness does him credit."

　　There was a sound of wheels outside in the street.

　　"There is M. Vautrin, mamma," said the girl. "Just take M. Eugene. I would rather not have that man see me like this; there are some ways of looking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as though you had nothing on."

　　"Oh, no, you are wrong!" said Mme. Couture. "M. Vautrin is a worthy man; he reminds me a little of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture, rough but kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite."

　　Vautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but looked for a while at the picture of the two young faces--the lamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them.

　　"Well," he remarked, folding his arms, "here is a picture! It would have suggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint- Pierre (good soul), who wrote Paul et Virginie. Youth is very charming, Mme. Couture!--Sleep on, poor boy," he added, looking at Eugene, "luck sometimes comes while you are sleeping.--There is something touching and attractive to me about this young man, madame," he continued; "I know that his nature is in harmony with his face. Just look, the head of a cherub on an angel's shoulder! He deserves to be loved. If I were a woman, I would die (no--not such a fool), I would live for him." He bent lower and spoke in the widow's ear. "When I see those two together, madame, I cannot help thinking that Providence meant them for each other; He works by secret ways, and tries the reins and the heart," he said in a loud voice. "And when I see you, my children, thus united by a like purity and by all human affections, I say to myself that it is quite impossible that the future should separate you. God is just."--He turned to Victorine. "It seems to me," he said, "that I have seen the line of success in your hand. Let me look at it, Mlle. Victorine; I am well up in palmistry, and I have told fortunes many a time. Come, now, don't be frightened. Ah! what do I see? Upon my word, you will be one of the richest heiresses in Paris before very long. You will heap riches on the man who loves you. Your father will want you to go and live with him. You will marry a young and handsome man with a title, and he will idolize you."

　　The heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the stairs, interrupted Vautrin's fortune-telling. "Here is Mamma Vauquerre, fair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life.--Aren't we a trifle pinched for room?" he inquired, with his arm round the lady; "we are screwed up very tightly about the bust, mamma! If we are much agitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up the fragments with all the care of an antiquary."

　　"There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry!" said the widow, bending to speak in Mme. Couture's ear.

　　"Good-bye, little ones!" said Vautrin, turning to Eugene and Victorine. "Bless you both!" and he laid a hand on either head. "Take my word for it, young lady, an honest man's prayers are worth something; they should bring you happiness, for God hears them."

　　"Good-bye, dear," said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger. "Do you think that M. Vautrin means to run away with me?" she added, lowering her voice.

　　"Lack-a-day!" said the widow.

　　"Oh! mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M. Vautrin said!" said Victorine with a sigh as she looked at her hands. The two women were alone together.

　　"Why, it wouldn't take much to bring it to pass," said the elderly lady; "just a fall from his horse, and your monster of a brother----"

　　"Oh! mamma."

　　"Good Lord! Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy," the widow remarked. "I will do penance for it. Still, I would strew flowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the truth. Black-hearted, that he is! The coward couldn't speak up for his own mother, and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery. My cousin had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you, nothing was said in the marriage-contract about anything that she might come in for."

　　"It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his life," said Victorine. "If I cannot be happy unless my brother is to be taken out of the world, I would rather stay here all my life."

　　"MON DIEU! it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full of piety, you see," Mme. Couture remarked. "I am very glad to find that he is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the Almighty with less respect than they do of the Devil. Well, as he was saying, who can know the ways by which it may please Providence to lead us?"

　　With Sylvie's help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene up to his room; they laid him on the bed, and the cook unfastened his clothes to make him more comfortable. Before they left the room, Victorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian's back was turned, and pressed a kiss on Eugene's forehead, feeling all the joy that this stolen pleasure could give her. Then she looked round the room, and gathering up, as it were, into one single thought all the untold bliss of that day, she made a picture of her memories, and dwelt upon it until she slept, the happiest creature in Paris.

　　That evening's merry-making, in the course of which Vautrin had given the drugged wine to Eugene and Father Goriot, was his own ruin. Bianchon, flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of Trompe-la-Mort with Mlle. Michonneau. The mere mention of the name would have set Vautrin on his guard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his real name, Jacques Collin, was in fact the notorious escaped convict.

　　But it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally decided his fate. Mlle. Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to warn the convict and to throw herself on his generosity, with the idea of making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that night; but as it was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the famous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, still thinking that it was the district superintendent--one Gondureau--with whom she had to do. The head of the department received his visitors courteously. There was a little talk, and the details were definitely arranged. Mlle. Michonneau asked for the draught that she was to administer in order to set about her investigation. But the great man's evident satisfaction set Mlle. Michonneau thinking; and she began to see that this business involved something more than the mere capture of a runaway convict. She racked her brains while he looked in a drawer in his desk for the little phial, and it dawned upon her that in consequence of treacherous revelations made by the prisoners the police were hoping to lay their hands on a considerable sum of money. But on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, that officer began to smile, and tried to put her off the scent.

　　"A delusion," he said. "Collin's sorbonne is the most dangerous that has yet been found among the dangerous classes. That is all, and the rascals are quite aware of it. They rally round him; he is the backbone of the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very popular with them all. The rogue will never leave his chump in the Place de Greve."

　　As Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two slang words for her benefit. Sorbonne and chump are two forcible expressions borrowed from thieves' Latin, thieves, of all people, being compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. A sorbonne is the head of a living man, his faculty of thinking-- his council; a chump is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a human head is worth after the axe has done its work.

　　"Collin is playing us off," he continued. "When we come across a man like a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion, there is always one resource left--we can kill him if he takes it into his head to make the least resistance. We are reckoning on several methods of killing Collin to-morrow morning. It saves a trial, and society is rid of him without all the expense of guarding and feeding him. What with getting up the case, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and carrying out the sentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper formalities before you can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings, over and above the three thousand francs that you are going to have. There is a saving in time as well. One good thrust of the bayonet into Trompe-la- Mort's paunch will prevent scores of crimes, and save fifty scoundrels from following his example; they will be very careful to keep themselves out of the police courts. That is doing the work of the police thoroughly, and true philanthropists will tell you that it is better to prevent crime than to punish it."

　　"And you do a service to our country," said Poiret.

　　"Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you are," said the head of the department. "Yes, of course, we are serving our country, and we are very hardly used too. We do society very great services that are not recognized. In fact, a superior man must rise above vulgar prejudices, and a Christian must resign himself to the mishaps that doing right entails, when right is done in an out-of-the-way style. Paris is Paris, you see! That is the explanation of my life.--I have the honor to wish you a good-evening, mademoiselle. I shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning. Send Christophe to the Rue du Buffon, tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in the house where you saw me before.--Your servant, sir. If you should ever have anything stolen from you, come to me, and I will do my best to get it back for you."

　　"Well, now," Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau, "there are idiots who are scared out of their wits by the word police. That was a very pleasant-spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as easy as saying 'Good-day.' "

　　The next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the annals of the Maison Vauquer. Hitherto the most startling occurrence in its tranquil existence had been the portentous, meteor-like apparition of the sham Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil. But the catastrophes of this great day were to cast all previous events into the shade, and supply an inexhaustible topic of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her boarders so long as she lived.

　　In the first place, Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till close upon eleven o'clock. Mme. Vauquer, who came home about midnight from the Gaite, lay a-bed till half-past ten. Christophe, after a prolonged slumber (he had finished Vautrin's first bottle of wine), was behindhand with his work, but Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered no complaint, though breakfast was delayed. As for Victorine and Mme. Couture, they also lay late. Vautrin went out before eight o'clock, and only came back just as breakfast was ready. Nobody protested, therefore, when Sylvie and Christophe went up at a quarter past eleven, knocked at all the doors, and announced that breakfast was waiting. While Sylvie and the man were upstairs, Mlle. Michonneau, who came down first, poured the contents of the phial into the silver cup belonging to Vautrin--it was standing with the others in the bain-marie that kept the cream hot for the morning coffee. The spinster had reckoned on this custom of the house to do her stroke of business. The seven lodgers were at last collected together, not without some difficulty. Just as Eugene came downstairs, stretching himself and yawning, a commissionaire handed him a letter from Mme. de Nucingen. It ran thus:--

　　"I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my friend. Till two o'clock this morning I waited for you. Oh, that waiting for one whom you love! No one that had passed through that torture could inflict it on another. I know now that you have never loved before. What can have happened? Anxiety has taken hold of me. I would have come myself to find out what had happened, if I had not feared to betray the secrets of my heart. How can I walk out or drive out at this time of day? Would it not be ruin? I have felt to the full how wretched it is to be a woman. Send a word to reassure me, and explain how it is that you have not come after what my father told you. I shall be angry, but I will forgive you. One word, for pity's sake. You will come to me soon, will you not? If you are busy, a line will be enough. Say, 'I will hasten to you,' or else, 'I am ill.' But if you were ill my father would have come to tell me so. What can have happened? . . ."

　　"Yes, indeed, what has happened?" exclaimed Eugene, and, hurrying down to the dining-room, he crumpled up the letter without reading any more. "What time is it?"

　　"Half-past eleven," said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his coffee.

　　The escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene, a cold and fascinating glance; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics in a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. Eugene shook in every limb. There was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another moment a man with a scared face rushed into the room. It was one of M. Taillefer's servants; Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once.

　　"Mademoiselle," he cried, "your father is asking for you-- something terrible has happened! M. Frederic has had a sword thrust in the forehead in a duel, and the doctors have given him up. You will scarcely be in time to say good-bye to him! he is unconscious."

　　"Poor young fellow!" exclaimed Vautrin. "How can people brawl when they have a certain income of thirty thousand livres? Young people have bad manners, and that is a fact."

　　"Sir!" cried Eugene.

　　"Well, what then, you big baby!" said Vautrin, swallowing down his coffee imperturbably, an operation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with such close attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing news that had struck the others dumb with amazement. "Are there not duels every morning in Paris?" added Vautrin.

　　"I will go with you, Victorine," said Mme. Couture, and the two women hurried away at once without either hats or shawls. But before she went, Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugene a glance that said--"How little I thought that our happiness should cost me tears!"

　　"Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin," said Mme. Vauquer.

　　"I am all sorts of things," said Vautrin.

　　"Queer, isn't it?" said Mme. Vauquer, stringing together a succession of commonplaces suited to the occasion. "Death takes us off without asking us about it. The young often go before the old. It is a lucky thing for us women that we are not liable to fight duels, but we have other complaints that men don't suffer from. We bear children, and it takes a long time to get over it. What a windfall for Victorine! Her father will have to acknowledge her now!"

　　"There!" said Vautrin, looking at Eugene, "yesterday she had not a penny; this morning she has several millions to her fortune."

　　"I say, M. Eugene!" cried Mme. Vauquer, "you have landed on your feet!"

　　At this exclamation, Father Goriot looked at the student, and saw the crumpled letter still in his hand.

　　"You have not read it through! What does this mean? Are you going to be like the rest of them?" he asked.

　　"Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine," said Eugene, turning to Mme. Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised the onlookers at this scene.

　　Father Goriot caught the student's hand and grasped it warmly. He could have kissed it.

　　"Oh, ho!" said Vautrin, "the Italians have a good proverb--Col tempo."

　　"Is there any answer?" said Mme. de Nucingen's messenger, addressing Eugene.

　　"Say that I will come directly."

　　The man went. Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he could not be prudent.

　　"What is to be done?" he exclaimed aloud. "There are no proofs!"

　　Vautrin began to smile. Though the drug he had taken was doing its work, the convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet, gave Rastignac a look, and said in hollow tones, "Luck comes to us while we sleep, young man," and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck dead.

　　"So there is a Divine Justice!" said Eugene.

　　"Well, if ever! What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin?"

　　"A stroke!" cried Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"Here, Sylvie! girl, run for the doctor," called the widow. "Oh, M. Rastignac, just go for M. Bianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie might not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel."

　　Rastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors, his hurry for the doctor was nothing but a flight.

　　"Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist's and ask for something that's good for the apoplexy."

　　Christophe likewise went.

　　"Father Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs."

　　Vautrin was taken up among them, carried carefully up the narrow staircase, and laid upon his bed.

　　"I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter," said M. Goriot.

　　"Selfish old thing!" cried Mme. Vauquer. "Yes, go; I wish you may die like a dog."

　　"Just go and see if you can find some ether," said Mlle. Michonneau to Mme. Vauquer; the former, with some help from Poiret, had unfastened the sick man's clothes.

　　Mme. Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress of the situation.

　　"Now! just pull down his shirt and turn him over, quick! You might be of some use in sparing my modesty," she said to Poiret, "instead of standing there like a stock."

　　Vautrin was turned over; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp slap, and the two portentous letters appeared, white against the red.

　　"There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily," exclaimed Poiret, supporting Vautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped on the shirt again.--"Ouf! How heavy he is," he added, as he laid the convict down.

　　"Hush! Suppose there is a strong-box here!" said the old maid briskly; her glances seemed to pierce the walls, she scrutinized every article of the furniture with greedy eyes. "Could we find some excuse for opening that desk?"

　　"It mightn't be quite right," responded Poiret to this.

　　"Where is the harm? It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so it doesn't belong to any one now. But we haven't time, there is the Vauquer."

　　"Here is the ether," said that lady. "I must say that this is an eventful day. Lord! that man can't have had a stroke; he is as white as curds."

　　"White as curds?" echoed Poiret.

　　"And his pulse is steady," said the widow, laying her hand on his breast.

　　"Steady?" said the astonished Poiret.

　　"He is all right."

　　"Do you think so?" asked Poiret.

　　"Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a doctor. I say, Mlle. Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is only a spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a Turk. Just look, mademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort of man to live till he is a hundred. His wig holds on tightly, however. Dear me! it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why he wears a wig. They say that red- haired people are either the worst or the best. Is he one of the good ones, I wonder?"

　　"Good to hang," said Poiret.

　　"Round a pretty woman's neck, you mean," said Mlle Michonneau, hastily. "Just go away, M. Poiret. It is a woman's duty to nurse you men when you are ill. Besides, for all the good you are doing, you may as well take yourself off," she added. "Mme. Vauquer and I will take great care of dear M. Vautrin.

　　Poiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of the room by his master.

　　Rastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted to breathe the air, he felt stifled. Yesterday evening he had meant to prevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning. What had happened? What ought he to do now? He trembled to think that he himself might be implicated. Vautrin's coolness still further dismayed him.

　　"Yet, how if Vautrin should die without saying a word?" Rastignac asked himself.

　　He hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds of justice were after him, and he already heard the baying of the pack.

　　"Well?" shouted Bianchon, "you have seen the Pilote?"

　　The Pilote was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. It came out several hours later than the morning papers, and was meant for the benefit of country subscribers; for it brought the morning news into provincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local journals.

　　"There is a wonderful history in it," said the house student of the Hopital Cochin. "Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini, of the Old Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his forehead. And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in Paris! If we had known that, eh? What a game of chance death is! They say Victorine was sweet on you; was there any truth in it?"

　　"Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. I am in love with a charming woman, and she is in love with me, so----"

　　"You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to her. I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master Taillefer's money!"

　　"Are all the devils of hell at my heels?" cried Rastignac.

　　"What is the matter with you? Are you mad? Give us your hand," said Bianchon, "and let me feel your pulse. You are feverish."

　　"Just go to Mother Vauquer's," said Rastignac; "that scoundrel Vautrin has dropped down like one dead."

　　"Aha!" said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, "you confirm my suspicions, and now I mean to make sure for myself."

　　The law student's long walk was a memorable one for him. He made in some sort a survey of his conscience. After a close scrutiny, after hesitation and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out scatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron tested in the English fashion. He remembered Father Goriot's confidences of the evening before; he recollected the rooms taken for him in the Rue d'Artois, so that he might be near Delphine; and then he thought of his letter, and read it again and kissed it.

　　"Such a love is my anchor of safety," he said to himself. "How the old man's heart must have been wrung! He says nothing about all that he has been through; but who could not guess? Well, then, I will be like a son to him; his life shall be made happy. If she cares for me, she will often come to spend the day with him. That grand Comtesse de Restaud is a heartless thing; she would make her father into her hall porter. Dear Delphine! she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to be loved. Ah! this evening I shall be very happy!"

　　He took out his watch and admired it.

　　"I have had nothing but success! If two people mean to love each other for ever, they may help each other, and I can take this. Besides, I shall succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. There is nothing criminal in this liaison; nothing that could cause the most austere moralist to frown. How many respectable people contract similar unions! We deceive nobody; it is deception that makes a position humiliating. If you lie, you lower yourself at once. She and her husband have lived apart for a long while. Besides, how if I called upon that Alsatian to resign a wife whom he cannot make happy?"

　　Rastignac's battle with himself went on for a long while; and though the scruples of youth inevitably gained the day, an irresistible curiosity led him, about half-past four, to return to the Maison Vauquer through the gathering dusk.

　　Bianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the stomach for chemical analysis at the hospital. Mlle. Michonneau's officious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions of her. Vautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly that it was impossible not to suspect some plot against the leader of all frolics at the lodging-house. Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in the dining-room when Rastignac came in. All the lodgers were assembled sooner than usual by the news of young Taillefer's duel. They were anxious to hear any detail about the affair, and to talk over the probable change in Victorine's prospects. Father Goriot alone was absent, but the rest were chatting. No sooner did Eugene come into the room, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin. It was the same look that had read his thoughts before--the look that had such power to waken evil thoughts in his heart. He shuddered.

　　"Well, dear boy," said the escaped convict, "I am likely to cheat death for a good while yet. According to these ladies, I have had a stroke that would have felled an ox, and come off with flying colors."

　　"A bull you might say," cried the widow.

　　"You really might be sorry to see me still alive," said Vautrin in Rastignac's ear, thinking that he guessed the student's thoughts. "You must be mighty sure of yourself."

　　"Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a gentleman named Trompe-la-Mort," said Bianchon; "and, upon my word, that name would do very well for you."

　　Vautrin seemed thunderstruck. He turned pale, and staggered back. He turned his magnetic glance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle. Michonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of that strong will, and collapsed into a chair. The mask of good-nature had dropped from the convict's face; from the unmistakable ferocity of that sinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger, and hastily stepped between them. None of the lodgers understood this scene in the least, they looked on in mute amazement. There was a pause. Just then there was a sound of tramping feet outside; there were soldiers there, it seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles on the pavement of the street. Collin was mechanically looking round the walls for a way of escape, when four men entered by way of the sitting-room.

　　"In the name of the King and the Law!" said an officer, but the words were almost lost in a murmur of astonishment.

　　Silence fell on the room. The lodgers made way for three of the men, who had each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket. Two policemen, who followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the sitting-room, and two more men appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase. A sound of footsteps came from the garden, and again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobblestones under the window. All chance of salvation by flight was cut off for Trompe-la-Mort, to whom all eyes instinctively turned. The chief walked straight up to him, and commenced operations by giving him a sharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell off, and Collin's face was revealed in all its ugliness. There was a terrible suggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short, brick-red crop of hair, the whole head was in harmony with his powerful frame, and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes. In that flash the real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once before them all; they understood his past, his present, and future, his pitiless doctrines, his actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty with which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the physical strength of an organization proof against all trials. The blood flew to his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. He started back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew exclamations of alarm from the lodgers. At that leonine start the police caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor. Collin saw the gleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and instantly gave proof of a power of the highest order. There was something horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his face; he could only be compared to a cauldron full of the steam that can send mountains flying, a terrific force dispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. The drop of water that cooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across his brain like lightning. He began to smile, and looked down at his wig.

　　"You are not in the politest of humors to-day," he remarked to the chief, and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his head.

　　"Gentlemen," he said, "put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call on those present to witness that I make no resistance."

　　A murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring like fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally sudden cessation.

　　"There's a sell for you, master crusher," the convict added, looking at the famous director of police.

　　"Come, strip!" said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.

　　"Why?" asked Collin. "There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and surrender."

　　He paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to overwhelm his audience.

　　"Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle," he went on, addressing a little, white-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table; and after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to draw up a document. "I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin, otherwise known as Trompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years' penal servitude, and I have just proved that I have come fairly by my nickname.--If I had as much as raised my hand," he went on, addressing the other lodgers, "those three sneaking wretches yonder would have drawn claret on Mamma Vauquer's domestic hearth. The rogues have laid their heads together to set a trap for me."

　　Mme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words.

　　"Good Lord!" she cried, "this does give one a turn; and me at the Gaite with him only last night!" she said to Sylvie.

　　"Summon your philosophy, mamma," Collin resumed. "Is it a misfortune to have sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening? After all, are you better than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful than the brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society rotten to the core. Not the best man among you could stand up to me." His eyes rested upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile that seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his eyes.--"Our little bargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept any time you like! Do you understand?" And he sang:

　　"A charming girl is my Fanchette   In her simplicity."

　　"Don't you trouble yourself," he went on; "I can get in my money. They are too much afraid of me to swindle me."

　　The convicts' prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp transitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur, its triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the speaker's discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and mouthpiece of a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race of savages. In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno, wherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature (save repentance) find a place. He looked about him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the end. Rastignac lowered his eyes, and acknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own evil thoughts.

　　"Who betrayed me?" said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round the room. Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"It was you, old cat!" he said. "That sham stroke of apoplexy was your doing, lynx eyes! . . . Two words from me, and your throat would be cut in less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You did not sell me either. But who did?----Aha! you may rummage upstairs," he shouted, hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking possession of his effects. "The nest is empty, the birds flew away yesterday, and you will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here," he said tapping his forehead. "Now I know who sold me! It could only be that blackguard Fil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh?" he said, turning to the chief. "It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up above there. There is nothing left for you--spies! As for Fil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight, even if you were to tell off the whole force to protect him. How much did you give the Michonnette?" he asked of the police officers. "A thousand crowns? Oh you Ninon in decay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of the graveyard, I was worth more than that! If you had given me warning, you should have had six thousand francs. Ah! you had no suspicion of that, old trafficker in flesh and blood, or I should have had the preference. Yes, I would have given six thousand francs to save myself an inconvenient journey and some loss of money," he said, as they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. "These folks will amuse themselves by dragging out this business till the end of time to keep me idle. If they were to send me straight to jail, I should soon be back at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai des Orfevres. Down yonder they will all turn themselves inside out to help their general--their good Trompe-la-Mort--to get clear away. Is there a single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten thousand brothers ready to do anything for him?" he asked proudly. "There is some good there," he said tapping his heart; "I have never betrayed any one!--Look you here, you slut," he said to the old maid, "they are all afraid of me, do you see? but the sight of you turns them sick. Rake in your gains."

　　He was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers' faces.

　　"What dolts you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before? A convict of Collin's stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less weak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal fraud of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is proud to declare himself. In short, I stand here single-handed against a Government and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police, and I am a match for them all."

　　"Ye gods!" cried the painter, "what a magnificent sketch one might make of him!"

　　"Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet, master of ceremonies to the widow" (a nickname full of sombre poetry, given by prisoners to the guillotine), "be a good fellow, and tell me if it really was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don't want him to suffer for some one else, that would not be fair."

　　But before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party returned from making their investigations upstairs. Everything had been opened and inventoried. A few words passed between them and the chief, and the official preliminaries were complete.

　　"Gentlemen," said Collin, addressing the lodgers, "they will take me away directly. You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and I shall look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux, and permit me to send you figs from Provence."

　　He advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at Rastignac.

　　"Good-bye, Eugene," he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange transition from his previous rough and stern manner. "If you should be hard up, I have left you a devoted friend," and, in spite of his shackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, "One, two!" like a fencing-master, and lunged. "If anything goes wrong, apply in that quarter. Man and money, all at your service."

　　The strange speaker's manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no one but Rastignac knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the pantomime.

　　As soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house, Sylvie, who was rubbing her mistress' temples with vinegar, looked round at the bewildered lodgers.

　　"Well," said she, "he was a man, he was, for all that."

　　Her words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too much moved by very various feelings to speak. But now the lodgers began to look at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on Mlle. Michonneau, a thin, shriveled, dead- alive, mummy-like figure, crouching by the stove; her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that the green eye-shade could not shut out the expression of those faces from her. This figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long excited were explained all at once. A smothered murmur filled the room; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of loathing had pitched all the voices in one key. Mlle. Michonneau heard it, and did not stir. It was Bianchon who was the first to move; he bent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, "If that creature is going to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall clear out."

　　In the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room, save Poiret, was of the medical student's opinion, so that the latter, strong in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.

　　"You are more intimate with Mlle. Michonneau than the rest of us," he said; "speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at once."

　　"At once!" echoed Poiret in amazement.

　　Then he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in her ear.

　　"I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be here as any one else," she said, with a viperous look at the boarders.

　　"Never mind that! we will club together and pay you the money back," said Rastignac.

　　"Monsieur is taking Collin's part" she said, with a questioning, malignant glance at the law student; "it is not difficult to guess why."

　　Eugene started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her and wring her neck. That glance, and the depths of treachery that it revealed, had been a hideous enlightenment.

　　"Let her alone!" cried the boarders.

　　Rastignac folded his arms and was silent.

　　"Let us have no more of Mlle. Judas," said the painter, turning to Mme. Vauquer. "If you don't show the Michonneau the door, madame, we shall all leave your shop, and wherever we go we shall say that there are only convicts and spies left there. If you do the other thing, we will hold our tongues about the business; for when all is said and done, it might happen in the best society until they brand them on the forehead, when they send them to the hulks. They ought not to let convicts go about Paris disguised like decent citizens, so as to carry on their antics like a set of rascally humbugs, which they are."

　　At this Mme. Vauquer recovered miraculously. She sat up and folded her arms; her eyes were wide open now, and there was no sign of tears in them.

　　"Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear sir? There is M. Vautrin----Goodness," she cried, interrupting herself, "I can't help calling him by the name he passed himself off by for an honest man! There is one room to let already, and you want me to turn out two more lodgers in the middle of the season, when no one is moving----"

　　"Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux's in the Place Sorbonne," cried Bianchon.

　　Mme. Vauquer glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her interest lay. She waddled across to Mlle. Michonneau.

　　"Come, now," she said; "you would not be the ruin of my establishment, would you, eh? There's a dear, kind soul. You see what a pass these gentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this evening."

　　"Never a bit of it!" cried the boarders. "She must go, and go this minute!"

　　"But the poor lady has had no dinner," said Poiret, with piteous entreaty.

　　"She can go and dine where she likes," shouted several voices.

　　"Turn her out, the spy!"

　　"Turn them both out! Spies!"

　　"Gentlemen," cried Poiret, his heart swelling with the courage that love gives to the ovine male, "respect the weaker sex."

　　"Spies are of no sex!" said the painter.

　　"A precious sexorama!"

　　"Turn her into the streetorama!"

　　"Gentlemen, this is not manners! If you turn people out of the house, it ought not to be done so unceremoniously and with no notice at all. We have paid our money, and we are not going," said Poiret, putting on his cap, and taking a chair beside Mlle. Michonneau, with whom Mme. Vauquer was remonstrating.

　　"Naughty boy!" said the painter, with a comical look; "run away, naughty little boy!"

　　"Look here," said Bianchon; "if you do not go, all the rest of us will," and the boarders, to a man, made for the sitting-room- door.

　　"Oh! mademoiselle, what is to be done?" cried Mme. Vauquer. "I am a ruined woman. You can't stay here; they will go further, do something violent."

　　Mlle. Michonneau rose to her feet.

　　"She is going!--She is not going!--She is going!--No, she isn't."

　　These alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions, borne out by the behavior of the insurgents, compelled Mlle. Michonneau to take her departure. She made some stipulations, speaking in a low voice in her hostess' ear, and then--"I shall go to Mme. Buneaud's," she said, with a threatening look.

　　"Go where you please, mademoiselle," said Mme. Vauquer, who regarded this choice of an opposition establishment as an atrocious insult. "Go and lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would give a cat the colic, and the food is cheap and nasty."

　　The boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was spoken. Poiret looked so wistfully after Mlle. Michonneau, and so artlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or stay, that the boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. Michonneau, burst out laughing at the sight of him.

　　"Hist!--st!--st! Poiret," shouted the painter. "Hallo! I say, Poiret, hallo!" The employe from the Museum began to sing:

　　"Partant pour la Syrie,   Le jeune et beau Dunois . . ."

　　"Get along with you; you must be dying to go, trahit sua quemque voluptas!" said Bianchon.

　　"Every one to his taste--free rendering from Virgil," said the tutor.

　　Mlle. Michonneau made a movement as if to take Poiret's arm, with an appealing glance that he could not resist. The two went out together, the old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of applause, followed by peals of laughter.

　　"Bravo, Poiret!"

　　"Who would have thought it of old Poiret!"

　　"Apollo Poiret!"

　　"Mars Poiret!"

　　"Intrepid Poiret!"

　　A messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Mme. Vauquer, who read it through, and collapsed in her chair.

　　"The house might as well be burned down at once," cried she, "if there are to be any more of these thunderbolts! Young Taillefer died at three o'clock this afternoon. It serves me right for wishing well to those ladies at that poor man's expense. Mme. Couture and Victorine want me to send their things, because they are going to live with her father. M. Taillefer allows his daughter to keep old Mme. Couture as her lady companion. Four rooms to let! and five lodgers gone! . . ."

　　She sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears.

　　"Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think," she cried.

　　Once more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside.

　　"What! another windfall for somebody!" was Sylvie's comment.

　　But it was Goriot who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with happiness, that he seemed to have grown young again.

　　"Goriot in a cab!" cried the boarders; "the world is coming to an end."

　　The good soul made straight for Eugene, who was standing wrapped in thought in a corner, and laid a hand on the young man's arm.

　　"Come," he said, with gladness in his eyes.

　　"Then you haven't heard the news?" said Eugene. "Vautrin was an escaped convict; they have just arrested him; and young Taillefer is dead."

　　"Very well, but what business is it of ours?" replied Father Goriot. "I am going to dine with my daughter in YOUR HOUSE, do you understand? She is expecting you. Come!"

　　He carried off Rastignac with him by main force, and they departed in as great a hurry as a pair of eloping lovers.

　　"Now, let us have dinner," cried the painter, and every one drew his chair to the table.

　　"Well, I never," said the portly Sylvie. "Nothing goes right to- day! The haricot mutton has caught! Bah! you will have to eat it, burned as it is, more's the pity!"

　　Mme. Vauquer was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she looked round the table and saw only ten people where eighteen should be; but every one tried to comfort and cheer her. At first the dinner contingent, as was natural, talked about Vautrin and the day's events; but the conversation wound round to such topics of interest as duels, jails, justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made in the laws. They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Collin and Victorine and her brother. There might be only ten of them, but they made noise enough for twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of them than usual; that was the only difference between yesterday and to-day. Indifference to the fate of others is a matter of course in this selfish world, which, on the morrow of tragedy, seeks among the events of Paris for a fresh sensation for its daily renewed appetite, and this indifference soon gained the upper hand. Mme. Vauquer herself grew calmer under the soothing influence of hope, and the mouthpiece of hope was the portly Sylvie.

　　That day had gone by like a dream for Eugene, and the sense of unreality lasted into the evening; so that, in spite of his energetic character and clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat beside Goriot in the cab. The old man's voice was full of unwonted happiness, but Eugene had been shaken by so many emotions that the words sounded in his ears like words spoken in a dream.

　　"It was finished this morning! All three of us are going to dine there together, together! Do you understand? I have not dined with my Delphine, my little Delphine, these four years, and I shall have her for a whole evening! We have been at your lodging the whole time since morning. I have been working like a porter in my shirt sleeves, helping to carry in the furniture. Aha! you don't know what pretty ways she has; at table she will look after me, 'Here, papa, just try this, it is nice.' And I shall not be able to eat. Oh, it is a long while since I have been with her in quiet every-day life as we shall have her."

　　"It really seems as if the world has been turned upside down."

　　"Upside down?" repeated Father Goriot. "Why, the world has never been so right-side up. I see none but smiling faces in the streets, people who shake hands cordially and embrace each other, people who all look as happy as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble down a nice little dinner that she went with me to order of the chef at the Cafe des Anglais. But, pshaw! with her beside you gall and wormwood would be as sweet as honey."

　　"I feel as if I were coming back to life again," said Eugene.

　　"Why, hurry up there!" cried Father Goriot, letting down the window in front. "Get on faster; I will give you five francs if you get to the place I told you of in ten minutes time."

　　With this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous celerity.

　　"How that fellow crawls!" said Father Goriot.

　　"But where are you taking me?" Eugene asked him.

　　"To your own house," said Goriot.

　　The cab stopped in the Rue d'Artois. Father Goriot stepped out first and flung ten francs to the man with the recklessness of a widower returning to bachelor ways.

　　"Come along upstairs," he said to Rastignac. They crossed a courtyard, and climbed up to the third floor of a new and handsome house. There they stopped before a door; but before Goriot could ring, it was opened by Therese, Mme. de Nucingen's maid. Eugene found himself in a charming set of chambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a bedroom, and a study, looking out upon a garden. The furniture and the decorations of the little drawing-room were of the most daintily charming description, the room was full of soft light, and Delphine rose up from a low chair by the fire and stood before him. She set her fire-screen down on the chimney-piece, and spoke with tenderness in every tone of her voice.

　　"So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to understand!"

　　Therese left the room. The student took Delphine in his arms and held her in a tight clasp, his eyes filled with tears of joy. This last contrast between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just witnessed was too much for Rastignac's over- wrought nerves, after the day's strain and excitement that had wearied heart and brain; he was almost overcome by it.

　　"I felt sure myself that he loved you," murmured Father Goriot, while Eugene lay back bewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word or to reason out how and why the magic wand had been waved to bring about this final transformation scene.

　　"But you must see your rooms," said Mme. de Nucingen. She took his hand and led him into a room carpeted and furnished like her own; indeed, down to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in miniature of Delphine's apartment.

　　"There is no bed," said Rastignac.

　　"No, monsieur," she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand. Eugene, looking at her, understood, young though he yet was, how deeply modesty is implanted in the heart of a woman who loves.

　　"You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for ever," he said in her ear. "Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the more mysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say so, since we understand each other so well. No one shall learn our secret."

　　"Oh! so I am nobody, I suppose," growled the father.

　　"You know quite well that 'we' means you."

　　"Ah! that is what I wanted. You will not mind me, will you? I shall go and come like a good fairy who makes himself felt everywhere without being seen, shall I not? Eh, Delphinette, Ninette, Dedel--was it not a good idea of mine to say to you, 'There are some nice rooms to let in the Rue d'Artois; let us furnish them for him?' And she would not hear of it! Ah! your happiness has been all my doing. I am the author of your happiness and of your existence. Fathers must always be giving if they would be happy themselves; always giving--they would not be fathers else."

　　"Was that how it happened?" asked Eugene.

　　"Yes. She would not listen to me. She was afraid that people would talk, as if the rubbish that they say about you were to be compared with happiness! Why, all women dream of doing what she has done----"

　　Father Goriot found himself without an audience, for Mme. de Nucingen had led Rastignac into the study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low though the sound was.

　　The study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing was wanting there.

　　"Have we guessed your wishes rightly?" she asked, as they returned to the drawing-room for dinner.

　　"Yes," he said, "only too well, alas! For all this luxury so well carried out, this realization of pleasant dreams, the elegance that satisfies all the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly that I cannot but feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot accept it from you, and I am too poor as yet to----"

　　"Ah! ah! you say me nay already," she said with arch imperiousness, and a charming little pout of the lips, a woman's way of laughing away scruples.

　　But Eugene had submitted so lately to that solemn self- questioning, and Vautrin's arrest had so plainly shown him the depths of the pit that lay ready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor had been strengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be coaxed into abandoning his high- minded determinations. Profound melancholy filled his mind.

　　"Do you really mean to refuse?" said Mme. de Nucingen. "And do you know what such a refusal means? That you are not sure of yourself, that you do not dare to bind yourself to me. Are you really afraid of betraying my affection? If you love me, if I-- love you, why should you shrink back from such a slight obligation? If you but knew what a pleasure it has been to see after all the arrangements of this bachelor establishment, you would not hesitate any longer, you would ask me to forgive you for your hesitation. I had some money that belonged to you, and I have made good use of it, that is all. You mean this for magnanimity, but it is very little of you. You are asking me for far more than this. . . . Ah!" she cried, as Eugene's passionate glance was turned on her, "and you are making difficulties about the merest trifles. Of, if you feel no love whatever for me, refuse, by all means. My fate hangs on a word from you. Speak!-- Father," she said after a pause, "make him listen to reason. Can he imagine that I am less nice than he is on the point of honor?"

　　Father Goriot was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with a placid smile, as if he had found some balm for all the sorrows of life.

　　"Child that you are!" she cried again, catching Eugene's hand. "You are just beginning life; you find barriers at the outset that many a man finds insurmountable; a woman's hand opens the way and you shrink back! Why, you are sure to succeed! You will have a brilliant future. Success is written on that broad forehead of yours, and will you not be able to repay me my loan of today? Did not a lady in olden times arm her knight with sword and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a charger, so that he might fight for her in the tournament? Well, then, Eugene, these things that I offer you are the weapons of this age; every one who means to be something must have such tools as these. A pretty place your garret must be if it is like papa's room! See, dinner is waiting all this time. Do you want to make me unhappy?--Why don't you answer?" she said, shaking his hand. "MON DIEU! papa, make up his mind for him, or I will go away and never see him any more."

　　"I will make up your mind," said Goriot, coming down from the clouds. "Now, my dear M. Eugene, the next thing is to borrow money of the Jews, isn't it?"

　　"There is positively no help for it," said Eugene.

　　"All right, I will give you credit," said the other, drawing out a cheap leather pocket-book, much the worse for wear. "I have turned Jew myself; I paid for everything; here are the invoices. You do not owe a penny for anything here. It did not come to very much--five thousand francs at most, and I am going to lend you the money myself. I am not a woman--you can refuse me. You shall give me a receipt on a scrap of paper, and you can return it some time or other."

　　Delphine and Eugene looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to their eyes. Rastignac held out his hand and grasped Goriot's warmly.

　　"Well, what is all this about? Are you not my children?"

　　"Oh! my poor father," said Mme. de Nucingen, "how did you do it?"

　　"Ah! now you ask me. When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you, and saw you buying things as if they were wedding presents, I said to myself, 'She will never be able to pay for them.' The attorney says that those law proceedings will last quite six months before your husband can be made to disgorge your fortune. Well and good. I sold out my property in the funds that brought in thirteen hundred and fifty livres a year, and bought a safe annuity of twelve hundred francs a year for fifteen thousand francs. Then I paid your tradesmen out of the rest of the capital. As for me, children, I have a room upstairs for which I pay fifty crowns a year; I can live like a prince on two francs a day, and still have something left over. I shall not have to spend anything much on clothes, for I never wear anything out. This fortnight past I have been laughing in my sleeve, thinking to myself, 'How happy they are going to be!' and--well, now, are you not happy?"

　　"Oh papa! papa!" cried Mme. de Nucingen, springing to her father, who took her on his knee. She covered him with kisses, her fair hair brushed his cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown so bright and radiant.

　　"Dear father, what a father you are! No, there is not another father like you under the sun. If Eugene loved you before, what must he feel for you now?"

　　"Why, children, why Delphinette!" cried Goriot, who had not felt his daughter's heart beat against his breast for ten years, "do you want me to die of joy? My poor heart will break! Come, Monsieur Eugene, we are quits already." And the old man strained her to his breast with such fierce and passionate force that she cried out.

　　"Oh! you are hurting me!" she said.

　　"I am hurting you!" He grew pale at the words. The pain expressed in his face seemed greater than it is given to humanity to know. The agony of this Christ of paternity can only be compared with the masterpieces of those princes of the palette who have left for us the record of their visions of an agony suffered for a whole world by the Saviour of men. Father Goriot pressed his lips very gently against the waist than his fingers had grasped too roughly.

　　"Oh! no, no," he cried. "I have not hurt you, have I?" and his smile seemed to repeat the question. "YOU have hurt me with that cry just now.--The things cost rather more than that," he said in her ear, with another gentle kiss, "but I had to deceive him about it, or he would have been angry."

　　Eugene sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible love; he gazed at Goriot, and his face betrayed the artless admiration which shapes the beliefs of youth.

　　"I will be worthy of all this," he cried.

　　"Oh! my Eugene, that is nobly said," and Mme. de Nucingen kissed the law student on the forehead.

　　"He gave up Mlle. Taillefer and her millions for you," said Father Goriot. "Yes, the little thing was in love with you, and now that her brother is dead she is as rich as Croesus."

　　"Oh! why did you tell her?" cried Rastignac.

　　"Eugene," Delphine said in his ear, "I have one regret now this evening. Ah! how I will love you! and for ever!"

　　"This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married!" cried Goriot. "God may send me any suffering, so long as I do not suffer through you, and I can still say, 'In this short month of February I had more happiness than other men have in their whole lives.'--Look at me, Fifine!" he said to his daughter. "She is very beautiful, is she not? Tell me, now, have you seen many women with that pretty soft color--that little dimple of hers? No, I thought not. Ah, well, and but for me this lovely woman would never have been. And very soon happiness will make her a thousand times lovelier, happiness through you. I could give up my place in heaven to you, neighbor, if needs be, and go down to hell instead. Come, let us have dinner," he added, scarcely knowing what he said, "everything is ours."

　　"Poor dear father!"

　　He rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set a kiss on the plaits of hair. "If you only knew, little one, how happy you can make me--how little it takes to make me happy! Will you come and see me sometimes? I shall be just above, so it is only a step. Promise me, say that you will!"

　　"Yes, dear father."

　　"Say it again."

　　"Yes, I will, my kind father."

　　"Hush! hush! I should make you say it a hundred times over if I followed my own wishes. Let us have dinner."

　　The three behaved like children that evening, and Father Goriot's spirits were certainly not the least wild. He lay at his daughter's feet, kissed them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her dress; in short, no young lover could have been more extravagant or more tender.

　　"You see!" Delphine said with a look at Eugene, "so long as my father is with us, he monopolizes me. He will be rather in the way sometimes."

　　Eugene had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could not blame this speech that contained the germ of all ingratitude.

　　"And when will the rooms be ready?" asked Eugene, looking round. "We must all leave them this evening, I suppose."

　　"Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me," she answered, with an eloquent glance. "It is our night at the Italiens."

　　"I shall go to the pit," said her father.

　　It was midnight. Mme. de Nucingen's carriage was waiting for her, and Father Goriot and the student walked back to the Maison Vauquer, talking of Delphine, and warming over their talk till there grew up a curious rivalry between the two violent passions. Eugene could not help seeing that the father's self-less love was deeper and more steadfast than his own. For this worshiper Delphine was always pure and fair, and her father's adoration drew its fervor from a whole past as well as a future of love.

　　They found Mme. Vauquer by the stove, with Sylvie and Christophe to keep her company; the old landlady, sitting like Marius among the ruins of Carthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet remained to her, and bemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Sylvie. Tasso's lamentations as recorded in Byron's poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but for sheer force of truth they fall far short of the widow's cry from the depths.

　　"Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Sylvie! Oh dear! to have your house emptied in this way is enough to break your heart. What is life, now my lodgers are gone? Nothing at all. Just think of it! It is just as if all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your furniture is your life. How have I offended heaven to draw down all this trouble upon me? And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for twenty people! The police in my house too! We shall have to live on potatoes now, and Christophe will have to go!"

　　The Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said, "Madame," questioningly.

　　"Poor fellow!" said Sylvie, "he is like a dog."

　　"In the dead season, too! Nobody is moving now. I would like to know where the lodgers are to drop down from. It drives me distracted. And that old witch of a Michonneau goes and takes Poiret with her! What can she have done to make him so fond of her? He runs about after her like a little dog."

　　"Lord!" said Sylvie, flinging up her head, "those old maids are up to all sorts of tricks."

　　"There's that poor M. Vautrin that they made out to be a convict," the widow went on. "Well, you know that is too much for me, Sylvie; I can't bring myself to believe it. Such a lively man as he was, and paid fifteen francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you very penny on the nail too."

　　"And open-handed he was!" said Christophe.

　　"There is some mistake," said Sylvie.

　　"Why, no there isn't! he said so himself!" said Mme. Vauquer. "And to think that all these things have happened in my house, and in a quarter where you never see a cat go by. On my word as an honest woman, it's like a dream. For, look here, we saw Louis XVI. meet with his mishap; we saw the fall of the Emperor; and we saw him come back and fall again; there was nothing out of the way in all that, but lodging-houses are not liable to revolutions. You can do without a king, but you must eat all the same; and so long as a decent woman, a de Conflans born and bred, will give you all sorts of good things for dinner, nothing short of the end of the world ought to--but there, it is the end of the world, that is just what it is!"

　　"And to think that Mlle. Michonneau who made all this mischief is to have a thousand crowns a year for it, so I hear," cried Sylvie.

　　"Don't speak of her, she is a wicked woman!" said Mme. Vauquer. "She is going to the Buneaud, who charges less than cost. But the Buneaud is capable of anything; she must have done frightful things, robbed and murdered people in her time. SHE ought to be put in jail for life instead of that poor dear----"

　　Eugene and Goriot rang the door-bell at that moment.

　　"Ah! here are my two faithful lodgers," said the widow, sighing.

　　But the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections of the misfortunes of their lodging-house, announced to their hostess without more ado that they were about to remove to the Chaussee d'Antin.

　　"Sylvie!" cried the widow, "this is the last straw.--Gentlemen, this will be the death of me! It has quite upset me! There's a weight on my chest! I am ten years older for this day! Upon my word, I shall go out of my senses! And what is to be done with the haricots!--Oh, well, if I am to be left here all by myself, you shall go to-morrow, Christophe.--Good-night, gentlemen," and she went.

　　"What is the matter now?" Eugene inquired of Sylvie.

　　"Lord! everybody is going about his business, and that has addled her wits. There! she is crying upstairs. It will do her good to snivel a bit. It's the first time she has cried since I've been with her."

　　By the morning, Mme. Vauquer, to use her own expression, had "made up her mind to it." True, she still wore a doleful countenance, as might be expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and whose manner of life had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits about her. Her grief was genuine and profound; it was real pain of mind, for her purse had suffered, the routine of her existence had been broken. A lover's farewell glance at his lady-love's window is not more mournful than Mme. Vauquer's survey of the empty places round her table. Eugene administered comfort, telling the widow that Bianchon, whose term of residence at the hospital was about to expire, would doubtless take his (Rastignac's) place; that the official from the Museum had often expressed a desire to have Mme. Couture's rooms; and that in a very few days her household would be on the old footing.

　　"God send it may, my dear sir! but bad luck has come to lodge here. There'll be a death in the house before ten days are out, you'll see," and she gave a lugubrious look round the dining- room. "Whose turn will it be, I wonder?"

　　"It is just as well that we are moving out," said Eugene to Father Goriot in a low voice.

　　"Madame," said Sylvie, running in with a scared face, "I have not seen Mistigris these three days."

　　"Ah! well, if my cat is dead, if HE has gone and left us, I----"

　　The poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands and hid her face on the back of her armchair, quite overcome by this dreadful portent.

　　By twelve o'clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Eugene received a letter. The dainty envelope bore the Beauseant arms on the seal, and contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse's great ball, which had been talked of in Paris for a month. A little note for Eugene was slipped in with the card.

　　"I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to   interpret my sentiments to Mme. de Nucingen, so I am sending the   card for which you asked me to you. I shall be delighted to make   the acquaintance of Mme. de Restaud's sister. Pray introduce that   charming lady to me, and do not let her monopolize all your   affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine.   "VICOMTESSE DE BEAUSEANT."

　　"Well," said Eugene to himself, as he read the note a second time, "Mme. de Beauseant says pretty plainly that she does not want the Baron de Nucingen."

　　He went to Delphine at once in his joy. He had procured this pleasure for her, and doubtless he would receive the price of it. Mme. de Nucingen was dressing. Rastignac waited in her boudoir, enduring as best he might the natural impatience of an eager temperament for the reward desired and withheld for a year. Such sensations are only known once in a life. The first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is really a woman--that is to say, if she appears to him amid the splendid accessories that form a necessary background to life in the world of Paris--will never have a rival.

　　Love in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men nor women are the dupes of the commonplaces by which people seek to throw a veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of disinterestedness in their sentiments. In this country within a country, it is not merely required of a woman that she should satisfy the senses and the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still greater obligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless demands of a vanity that enters into every fibre of that living organism called society. Love, for her, is above all things, and by its very nature, a vainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious, thriftless charlatan. If at the Court of Louis XIV. there was not a woman but envied Mlle. de la Valliere the reckless devotion of passion that led the grand monarch to tear the priceless ruffles at his wrists in order to assist the entry of a Duc de Vermandois into the world--what can you expect of the rest of society? You must have youth and wealth and rank; nay, you must, if possible, have more than these, for the more incense you bring with you to burn at the shrine of the god, the more favorably will he regard the worshiper. Love is a religion, and his cult must in the nature of things be more costly than those of all other deities; Love the Spoiler stays for a moment, and then passes on; like the urchin of the streets, his course may be traced by the ravages that he has made. The wealth of feeling and imagination is the poetry of the garret; how should love exist there without that wealth?

　　If there are exceptions who do not subscribe to these Draconian laws of the Parisian code, they are solitary examples. Such souls live so far out of the main current that they are not borne away by the doctrines of society; they dwell beside some clear spring of everflowing water, without seeking to leave the green shade; happy to listen to the echoes of the infinite in everything around them and in their own souls, waiting in patience to take their flight for heaven, while they look with pity upon those of earth.

　　Rastignac, like most young men who have been early impressed by the circumstances of power and grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully armed; the burning ambition of conquest possessed him already; perhaps he was conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to which his ambition was to be directed, nor the means of attaining it. In default of the pure and sacred love that fills a life, ambition may become something very noble, subduing to itself every thought of personal interest, and setting as the end--the greatness, not of one man, but of a whole nation.

　　But the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man surveys the whole course of existence and judges it soberly. Hitherto he had scarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and gracious influences that envelop a childhood in the country, like green leaves and grass. He had hesitated on the brink of the Parisian Rubicon, and in spite of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to a lingering tradition of an old ideal--the peaceful life of the noble in his chateau. But yesterday evening, at the sight of his rooms, those scruples had vanished. He had learned what it was to enjoy the material advantages of fortune, as he had already enjoyed the social advantages of birth; he ceased to be a provincial from that moment, and slipped naturally and easily into a position which opened up a prospect of a brilliant future.

　　So, as he waited for Delphine, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt that he had a certain right to be, he felt himself so far away from the Rastignac who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some power of inner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that past self bore any resemblance to the Rastignac of that moment.

　　"Madame is in her room," Therese came to tell him. The woman's voice made him start.

　　He found Delphine lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking fresh and bright. The sight of her among the flowing draperies of muslin suggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is set amid the blossom.

　　"Well," she said, with a tremor in her voice, "here you are."

　　"Guess what I bring for you," said Eugene, sitting down beside her. He took possession of her arm to kiss her hand

　　Mme. de Nucingen gave a joyful start as she saw the card. She turned to Eugene; there were tears in her eyes as she flung her arms about his neck, and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity.

　　"And I owe this happiness to you--to THEE" (she whispered the more intimate word in his ear); "but Therese is in my dressing- room, let us be prudent.--This happiness--yes, for I may call it so, when it comes to me through YOU--is surely more than a triumph for self-love? No one has been willing to introduce me into that set. Perhaps just now I may seem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a Parisienne, but remember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for you; and that if I long more than ever for an entrance into the Faubourg Saint- Germain, it is because I shall meet you there."

　　"Mme. de Beauseant's note seems to say very plainly that she does not expect to see the BARON de Nucingen at her ball; don't you think so?" said Eugene.

　　"Why, yes," said the Baroness as she returned the letter. "Those women have a talent for insolence. But it is of no consequence, I shall go. My sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very beautifully dressed.--Eugene," she went on, lowering her voice, "she will go to dispel ugly suspicions. You do not know the things that people are saying about her. Only this morning Nucingen came to tell me that they had been discussing her at the club. Great heavens! on what does a woman's character and the honor of a whole family depend! I feel that I am nearly touched and wounded in my poor sister. According to some people, M. de Trailles must have put his name to bills for a hundred thousand francs, nearly all of them are overdue, and proceedings are threatened. In this predicament, it seems that my sister sold her diamonds to a Jew--the beautiful diamonds that belonged to her husband's mother, Mme. de Restaud the elder,--you have seen her wearing them. In fact, nothing else has been talked about for the last two days. So I can see that Anastasie is sure to come to Mme. de Beauseant's ball in tissue of gold, and ablaze with diamonds, to draw all eyes upon her; and I will not be outshone. She has tried to eclipse me all her life, she has never been kind to me, and I have helped her so often, and always had money for her when she had none.--But never mind other people now, to-day I mean to be perfectly happy."

　　At one o'clock that morning Eugene was still with Mme. de Nucingen. In the midst of their lovers' farewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss to come, she said in a troubled voice, "I am very fearful, superstitious. Give what name you like to my presentiments, but I am afraid that my happiness will be paid for by some horrible catastrophe."

　　"Child!" said Eugene.

　　"Ah! have we changed places, and am I the child to-night?" she asked, laughingly.

　　Eugene went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he should leave it for good on the morrow; and on the way he fell to dreaming the bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness has left its sweetness on the lips.

　　"Well?" cried Goriot, as Rastignac passed by his door.

　　"Yes," said Eugene; "I will tell you everything to-morrow."

　　"Everything, will you not?" cried the old man. "Go to bed. To- morrow our happy life will begin."

　　Next day, Goriot and Rastignac were ready to leave the lodging- house, and only awaited the good pleasure of a porter to move out of it; but towards noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and a carriage stopped before the door of the Maison Vauquer. Mme. de Nucingen alighted, and asked if her father was still in the house, and, receiving an affirmative reply from Sylvie, ran lightly upstairs.

　　It so happened that Eugene was at home all unknown to his neighbor. At breakfast time he had asked Goriot to superintend the removal of his goods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d'Artois at four o'clock; but Rastignac's name had been called early on the list at the Ecole de Droit, and he had gone back at once to the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. No one had seen him come in, for Goriot had gone to find a porter, and the mistress of the house was likewise out. Eugene had thought to pay her himself, for it struck him that if he left this, Goriot in his zeal would probably pay for him. As it was, Eugene went up to his room to see that nothing had been forgotten, and blessed his foresight when he saw the blank bill bearing Vautrin's signature lying in the drawer where he had carelessly thrown it on the day when he had repaid the amount. There was no fire in the grate, so he was about to tear it into little pieces, when he heard a voice speaking in Goriot's room, and the speaker was Delphine! He made no more noise, and stood still to listen, thinking that she should have no secrets from him; but after the first few words, the conversation between the father and daughter was so strange and interesting that it absorbed all his attention.

　　"Ah! thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of the money settled on me before I was utterly ruined, father. Is it safe to talk?" she added.

　　"Yes, there is no one in the house," said her father faintly.

　　"What is the matter with you?" asked Mme. de Nucingen.

　　"God forgive you! you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child!" said the old man. "You cannot know how much I love you, or you would not have burst in upon me like this, with such news, especially if all is not lost. Has something so important happened that you must come here about it? In a few minutes we should have been in the Rue d'Artois."

　　"Eh! does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? It has turned my head. Your attorney has found out the state of things now, but it was bound to come out sooner or later. We shall want your long business experience; and I come to you like a drowning man who catches at a branch. When M. Derville found that Nucingen was throwing all sorts of difficulties in his way, he threatened him with proceedings, and told him plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the President of the Tribunal. So Nucingen came to my room this morning, and asked if I meant to ruin us both. I told him that I knew nothing whatever about it, that I had a fortune, and ought to be put into possession of my fortune, and that my attorney was acting for me in the matter; I said again that I knew absolutely nothing about it, and could not possibly go into the subject with him. Wasn't that what you told me to tell him?"

　　"Yes, quite right," answered Goriot.

　　"Well, then," Delphine continued, "he told me all about his affairs. He had just invested all his capital and mine in business speculations; they have only just been started, and very large sums of money are locked up. If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now, he would be forced to file his petition; but if I will wait a year, he undertakes, on his honor, to double or treble my fortune, by investing it in building land, and I shall be mistress at last of the whole of my property. He was speaking the truth, father dear; he frightened me! He asked my pardon for his conduct; he has given me my liberty; I am free to act as I please on condition that I leave him to carry on my business in my name. To prove his sincerity, he promised that M. Derville might inspect the accounts as often as I pleased, so that I might be assured that everything was being conducted properly. In short, he put himself in my power, bound hand and foot. He wishes the present arrangements as to the expenses of housekeeping to continue for two more years, and entreated me not to exceed my allowance. He showed me plainly that it was all that he could do to keep up appearances; he has broken with his opera dancer; he will be compelled to practise the most strict economy (in secret) if he is to bide his time with unshaken credit. I scolded, I did all I could to drive him to desperation, so as to find out more. He showed me his ledgers--he broke down and cried at last. I never saw a man in such a state. He lost his head completely, talked of killing himself, and raved till I felt quite sorry for him."

　　"Do you really believe that silly rubbish?" . . . cried her father. "It was all got up for your benefit! I have had to do with Germans in the way of business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure to be, but when with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers and humbugs as well, they are the worst rogues of all. Your husband is taking advantage of you. As soon as pressure is brought to bear on him he shams dead; he means to be more the master under your name than in his own. He will take advantage of the position to secure himself against the risks of business. He is as sharp as he is treacherous; he is a bad lot! No, no; I am not going to leave my girls behind me without a penny when I go to Pere-Lachaise. I know something about business still. He has sunk his money in speculation, he says; very well then, there is something to show for it--bills, receipts, papers of some sort. Let him produce them, and come to an arrangement with you. We will choose the most promising of his speculations, take them over at our own risk, and have the securities transferred into your name; they shall represent the separate estate of Delphine Goriot, wife of the Baron de Nucingen. Does that fellow really take us for idiots? Does he imagine that I could stand the idea of your being without fortune, without bread, for forty-eight hours? I would not stand it a day--no, not a night, not a couple of hours! If there had been any foundation for the idea, I should never get over it. What! I have worked hard for forty years, carried sacks on my back, and sweated and pinched and saved all my life for you, my darlings, for you who made the toil and every burden borne for you seem light; and now, my fortune, my whole life, is to vanish in smoke! I should die raving mad if I believed a word of it. By all that's holiest in heaven and earth, we will have this cleared up at once; go through the books, have the whole business looked thoroughly into! I will not sleep, nor rest, nor eat until I have satisfied myself that all your fortune is in existence. Your money is settled upon you, God be thanked! and, luckily, your attorney, Maitre Derville, is an honest man. Good Lord! you shall have your snug little million, your fifty thousand francs a year, as long as you live, or I will raise a racket in Paris, I will so! If the Tribunals put upon us, I will appeal to the Chambers. If I knew that you were well and comfortably off as far as money is concerned, that thought would keep me easy in spite of bad health and troubles. Money? why, it is life! Money does everything. That great dolt of an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! Look here, Delphine, don't give way, don't make a concession of half a quarter of a farthing to that fathead, who has ground you down and made you miserable. If he can't do without you, we will give him a good cudgeling, and keep him in order. Great heavens! my brain is on fire; it is as if there were something redhot inside my head. My Delphine lying on straw! You! my Fifine! Good gracious! Where are my gloves? Come, let us go at once; I mean to see everything with my own eyes--books, cash, and correspondence, the whole business. I shall have no peace until I know for certain that your fortune is secure."

　　"Oh! father dear, be careful how you set about it! If there is the least hint of vengeance in the business, if you show yourself openly hostile, it will be all over with me. He knows whom he has to deal with; he thinks it quite natural that if you put the idea into my head, I should be uneasy about my money; but I swear to you that he has it in his own hands, and that he had meant to keep it. He is just the man to abscond with all the money and leave us in the lurch, the scoundrel! He knows quite well that I will not dishonor the name I bear by bringing him into a court of law. His position is strong and weak at the same time. If we drive him to despair, I am lost."

　　"Why, then, the man is a rogue?"

　　"Well, yes, father," she said, flinging herself into a chair, "I wanted to keep it from you to spare your feelings," and she burst into tears; "I did not want you to know that you had married me to such a man as he is. He is just the same in private life--body and soul and conscience--the same through and through--hideous! I hate him; I despise him! Yes, after all that that despicable Nucingen has told me, I cannot respect him any longer. A man capable of mixing himself up in such affairs, and of talking about them to me as he did, without the slightest scruple,--it is because I have read him through and through that I am afraid of him. He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me my liberty, and do you know what that means? It means that if things turn out badly for him, I am to play into his hands, and be his stalking- horse."

　　"But there is law to be had! There is a Place de Greve for sons- in-law of that sort," cried her father; "why, I would guillotine him myself if there was no headsman to do it."

　　"No, father, the law cannot touch him. Listen, this is what he says, stripped of all his circumlocutions--'Take your choice, you and no one else can be my accomplice; either everything is lost, you are ruined and have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business through myself.' Is that plain speaking? He MUST have my assistance. He is assured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows that I shall leave his money to him and be content with my own. It is an unholy and dishonest compact, and he holds out threats of ruin to compel me to consent to it. He is buying my conscience, and the price is liberty to be Eugene's wife in all but name. 'I connive at your errors, and you allow me to commit crimes and ruin poor families!' Is that sufficiently explicit? Do you know what he means by speculations? He buys up land in his own name, then he finds men of straw to run up houses upon it. These men make a bargain with a contractor to build the houses, paying them by bills at long dates; then in consideration of a small sum they leave my husband in possession of the houses, and finally slip through the fingers of the deluded contractors by going into bankruptcy. The name of the firm of Nucingen has been used to dazzle the poor contractors. I saw that. I noticed, too, that Nucingen had sent bills for large amounts to Amsterdam, London, Naples, and Vienna, in order to prove if necessary that large sums had been paid away by the firm. How could we get possession of those bills?"

　　Eugene heard a dull thud on the floor; Father Goriot must have fallen on his knees.

　　"Great heavens! what have I done to you? Bound my daughter to this scoundrel who does as he likes with her!--Oh! my child, my child! forgive me!" cried the old man.

　　"Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame," said Delphine. "We have so little sense when we marry! What do we know of the world, of business, or men, or life? Our fathers should think for us! Father dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for what I said. This is all my own fault. Nay, do not cry, papa," she said, kissing him.

　　"Do not cry either, my little Delphine. Look up and let me kiss away the tears. There! I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your husband's winding."

　　"No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. He is fond of me, well and good; I shall use my influence to make him invest my money as soon as possible in landed property in my own name. Very likely I could get him to buy back Nucingen in Alsace in my name; that has always been a pet idea of his. Still, come to-morrow and go through the books, and look into the business. M. Derville knows little of mercantile matters. No, not to-morrow though. I do not want to be upset. Mme. de Beauseant's ball will be the day after to-morrow, and I must keep quiet, so as to look my best and freshest, and do honor to my dear Eugene! . . . Come, let us see his room."

　　But as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue Nueve-Sainte- Genevieve, and the sound of Mme. de Restaud's voice came from the staircase. "Is my father in?" she asked of Sylvie.

　　This accident was luckily timed for Eugene, whose one idea had been to throw himself down on the bed and pretend to be asleep.

　　"Oh, father, have you heard about Anastasie?" said Delphine, when she heard her sister speak. "It looks as though some strange things had happened in that family."

　　"What sort of things?" asked Goriot. "This is like to be the death of me. My poor head will not stand a double misfortune."

　　"Good-morning, father," said the Countess from the threshold. "Oh! Delphine, are you here?"

　　Mme. de Restaud seemed taken aback by her sister's presence.

　　"Good-morning, Nasie," said the Baroness. "What is there so extraordinary in my being here? _I_ see our father every day."

　　"Since when?"

　　"If you came yourself you would know."

　　"Don't tease, Delphine," said the Countess fretfully. "I am very miserable, I am lost. Oh! my poor father, it is hopeless this time!"

　　"What is it, Nasie?" cried Goriot. "Tell us all about it, child! How white she is! Quick, do something, Delphine; be kind to her, and I will love you even better, if that were possible."

　　"Poor Nasie!" said Mme. de Nucingen, drawing her sister to a chair. "We are the only two people in the world whose love is always sufficient to forgive you everything. Family affection is the surest, you see."

　　The Countess inhaled the salts and revived.

　　"This will kill me!" said their father. "There," he went on, stirring the smouldering fire, "come nearer, both of you. It is cold. What is it, Nasie? Be quick and tell me, this is enough to----"

　　"Well, then, my husband knows everything," said the Countess. "Just imagine it; do you remember, father, that bill of Maxime's some time ago? Well, that was not the first. I had paid ever so many before that. About the beginning of January M. de Trailles seemed very much troubled. He said nothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts of those you love, a mere trifle is enough; and then you feel things instinctively. Indeed, he was more tender and affectionate than ever, and I was happier than I had ever been before. Poor Maxime! in himself he was really saying good-bye to me, so he has told me since; he meant to blow his brains out! At last I worried him so, and begged and implored so hard; for two hours I knelt at his knees and prayed and entreated, and at last he told me--that he owed a hundred thousand francs. Oh! papa! a hundred thousand francs! I was beside myself! You had not the money, I knew, I had eaten up all that you had----"

　　"No," said Goriot; "I could not have got it for you unless I had stolen it. But I would have done that for you, Nasie! I will do it yet."

　　The words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death rattle of a dying man; it seemed indeed like the agony of death when the father's love was powerless. There was a pause, and neither of the sisters spoke. It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear unmoved that cry of anguish that, like a pebble thrown over a precipice, revealed the depths of his despair.

　　"I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell," and the Countess burst into tears.

　　Delphine was touched; she laid her head on her sister's shoulder, and cried too.

　　"Then it is all true," she said.

　　Anastasie bowed her head, Mme. de Nucingen flung her arms about her, kissed her tenderly, and held her sister to her heart.

　　"I shall always love you and never judge you, Nasie," she said.

　　"My angels," murmured Goriot faintly. "Oh, why should it be trouble that draws you together?"

　　This warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess courage.

　　"To save Maxime's life," she said, "to save all my own happiness, I went to the money-lender you know of, a man of iron forged in hell-fire; nothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that M. de Restaud is so proud of--his and mine too--and sold them to that M. Gobseck. SOLD THEM! Do you understand? I saved Maxime, but I am lost. Restaud found it all out."

　　"How? Who told him? I will kill him," cried Goriot.

　　"Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. I went. . . . 'Anastasie,' he said in a voice--oh! such a voice; that was enough, it told me everything--'where are your diamonds?'--'In my room----'--'No,' he said, looking straight at me, 'there they are on that chest of drawers----' and he lifted his handkerchief and showed me the casket. 'Do you know where they came from?' he said. I fell at his feet. . . . I cried; I besought him to tell me the death he wished to see me die."

　　"You said that!" cried Goriot. "By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand on either of you so long as I am alive may reckon on being roasted by slow fires! Yes, I will cut him in pieces like . . ."

　　Goriot stopped; the words died away in his throat.

　　"And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. Oh! heaven preserve all other women from hearing such words as I heard then!"

　　"I will murder that man," said Goriot quietly. "But he has only one life, and he deserves to die twice.--And then, what next?" he added, looking at Anastasie.

　　"Then," the Countess resumed, "there was a pause, and he looked at me. 'Anastasie,' he said, 'I will bury this in silence; there shall be no separation; there are the children. I will not kill M. de Trailles. I might miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of him, I should come into collision with the law. If I killed him in your arms, it would bring dishonor on THOSE children. But if you do not want to see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you must first of all submit to two conditions. Answer me. Have I a child of my own?' I answered, 'Yes,'--'Which?'--'Ernest, our eldest boy.'--'Very well,' he said, 'and now swear to obey me in this particular from this time forward.' I swore. 'You will make over your property to me when I require you to do so.' "

　　"Do nothing of the kind!" cried Goriot. "Aha! M. de Restaud, you could not make your wife happy; she has looked for happiness and found it elsewhere, and you make her suffer for your own ineptitude? He will have to reckon with me. Make yourself easy, Nasie. Aha! he cares about his heir! Good, very good. I will get hold of the boy; isn't he my grandson? What the blazes! I can surely go to see the brat! I will stow him away somewhere; I will take care of him, you may be quite easy. I will bring Restaud to terms, the monster! I shall say to him, 'A word or two with you! If you want your son back again, give my daughter her property, and leave her to do as she pleases.' "

　　"Father!"

　　"Yes. I am your father, Nasie, a father indeed! That rogue of a great lord had better not ill-treat my daughter. Tonnerre! What is it in my veins? There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those two men to pieces! Oh! children, children! so this is what your lives are! Why, it is death! . . . What will become of you when I shall be here no longer? Fathers ought to live as long as their children. Ah! Lord God in heaven! how ill Thy world is ordered! Thou hast a Son, if what they tell us is true, and yet Thou leavest us to suffer so through our children. My darlings, my darlings! to think that trouble only should bring you to me, that I should only see you with tears on your faces! Ah! yes, yes, you love me, I see that you love me. Come to me and pour out your griefs to me; my heart is large enough to hold them all. Oh! you might rend my heart in pieces, and every fragment would make a father's heart. If only I could bear all your sorrows for you! . . . Ah! you were so happy when you were little and still with me. . . ."

　　"We have never been happy since," said Delphine. "Where are the old days when we slid down the sacks in the great granary?"

　　"That is not all, father," said Anastasie in Goriot's ear. The old man gave a startled shudder. "The diamonds only sold for a hundred thousand francs. Maxime is hard pressed. There are twelve thousand francs still to pay. He has given me his word that he will be steady and give up play in future. His love is all that I have left in the world. I have paid such a fearful price for it that I should die if I lose him now. I have sacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of mind, and my children for him. Oh! do something, so that at the least Maxime may be at large and live undisgraced in the world, where he will assuredly make a career for himself. Something more than my happiness is at stake; the children have nothing, and if he is sent to Sainte-Pelagie all his prospects will be ruined."

　　"I haven't the money, Nasie. I have NOTHING--nothing left. This is the end of everything. Yes, the world is crumbling into ruin, I am sure. Fly! Save yourselves! Ah!--I have still my silver buckles left, and half-a-dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my life. But I have nothing else except my life annuity, twelve hundred francs . . ."

　　"Then what has become of your money in the funds?"

　　"I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. I wanted twelve thousand francs to furnish some rooms for Delphine."

　　"In your own house?" asked Mme. de Restaud, looking at her sister.

　　"What does it matter where they were?" asked Goriot. "The money is spent now."

　　"I see how it is," said the Countess. "Rooms for M. de Rastignac. Poor Delphine, take warning by me!"

　　"M. de Rastignac is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear."

　　"Thanks! Delphine. I thought you would have been kinder to me in my troubles, but you never did love me."

　　"Yes, yes, she loves you, Nasie," cried Goriot; "she was saying so only just now. We were talking about you, and she insisted that you were beautiful, and that she herself was only pretty!"

　　"Pretty!" said the Countess. "She is as hard as a marble statue."

　　"And if I am?" cried Delphine, flushing up, "how have you treated me? You would not recognize me; you closed the doors of every house against me; you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me slip by. And when did I come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor father, a thousand francs at a time, till he is left as you see him now? That is all your doing, sister! I myself have seen my father as often as I could. I have not turned him out of the house, and then come and fawned upon him when I wanted money. I did not so much as know that he had spent those twelve thousand francs on me. I am economical, as you know; and when papa has made me presents, it has never been because I came and begged for them."

　　"You were better off than I. M. de Marsay was rich, as you have reason to know. You always were as slippery as gold. Good-bye; I have neither sister nor----"

　　"Oh! hush, hush, Nasie!" cried her father.

　　"Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. You are an unnatural sister!" cried Delphine.

　　"Oh, children, children! hush! hush! or I will kill myself before your eyes."

　　"There, Nasie, I forgive you," said Mme. de Nucingen; "you are very unhappy. But I am kinder than you are. How could you say THAT just when I was ready to do anything in the world to help you, even to be reconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I---- Oh! it is just like you; you have behaved cruelly to me all through these nine years."

　　"Children, children, kiss each other!" cried the father. "You are angels, both of you."

　　"No. Let me alone," cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her father had laid on her arm. "She is more merciless than my husband. Any one might think she was a model of all the virtues herself!"

　　"I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Marsay than own that M. de Trailles had cost me more than two hundred thousand francs," retorted Mme. de Nucingen.

　　"DELPHINE!" cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister.

　　"I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander me," said the Baroness coldly.

　　"Delphine! you are a ----"

　　Father Goriot sprang between them, grasped the Countess' hand, and laid his own over her mouth.

　　"Good heavens, father! What have you been handling this morning?" said Anastasie.

　　"Ah! well, yes, I ought not to have touched you," said the poor father, wiping his hands on his trousers, "but I have been packing up my things; I did not know that you were coming to see me."

　　He was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself.

　　"Ah!" he sighed, as he sat down, "you children have broken my heart between you. This is killing me. My head feels as if it were on fire. Be good to each other and love each other! This will be the death of me! Delphine! Nasie! come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong. Come, Dedel," he added, looking through his tears at the Baroness, "she must have twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can find them for her. Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that!" and he sank on his knees beside Delphine. "Ask her to forgive you--just to please me," he said in her ear. "She is more miserable than you are. Come now, Dedel."

　　"Poor Nasie!" said Delphine, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in her father's face, "I was in the wrong, kiss me----"

　　"Ah! that is like balm to my heart," cried Father Goriot. "But how are we to find twelve thousand francs? I might offer myself as a substitute in the army----"

　　"Oh! father dear!" they both cried, flinging their arms about him. "No, no!"

　　"God reward you for the thought. We are not worth it, are we, Nasie?" asked Delphine.

　　"And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket," observed the Countess.

　　"But is flesh and blood worth nothing?" cried the old man in his despair. "I would give body and soul to save you, Nasie. I would do a murder for the man who would rescue you. I would do, as Vautrin did, go to the hulks, go----" he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and put both hands to his head. "Nothing left!" he cried, tearing his hair. "If I only knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do it, and then you can't set to work by yourself, and it takes time to rob a bank. Yes, it is time I was dead; there is nothing left me to do but to die. I am no good in the world; I am no longer a father! No. She has come to me in her extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have nothing to give her. Ah! you put your money into a life annuity, old scoundrel; and had you not daughters? You did not love them. Die, die in a ditch, like the dog that you are! Yes, I am worse than a dog; a beast would not have done as I have done! Oh! my head . . . it throbs as if it would burst."

　　"Papa!" cried both the young women at once, "do, pray, be reasonable!" and they clung to him to prevent him from dashing his head against the wall. There was a sound of sobbing.

　　Eugene, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Vautrin's signature, saw that the stamp would suffice for a larger sum, altered the figures, made it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs, payable to Goriot's order, and went to his neighbor's room.

　　"Here is the money, madame," he said, handing the piece of paper to her. "I was asleep; your conversation awoke me, and by this means I learned all that I owed to M. Goriot. This bill can be discounted, and I shall meet it punctually at the due date."

　　The Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in her fingers.

　　"Delphine," she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering with indignation, anger, and rage, "I forgave you everything; God is my witness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! So this gentleman was there all the time, and you knew it! Your petty spite has let you to wreak your vengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my life, my children's lives, my shame, my honor! There, you are nothing to me any longer. I hate you. I will do all that I can to injure you. I will . . ."

　　Anger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat.

　　"Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver!" cried Goriot. "Kiss his hand, Nasie! Stay, I will embrace him myself," he said, straining Eugene to his breast in a frenzied clasp. "Oh my boy! I will be more than a father to you; if I had God's power, I would fling worlds at your feet. Why don't you kiss him, Nasie? He is not a man, but an angel, a angel out of heaven."

　　"Never mind her, father; she is mad just now."

　　"Mad! am I? And what are you?" cried Mme. de Restaud.

　　"Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this," cried the old man, and he staggered and fell on the bed as if a bullet had struck him.--"They are killing me between them," he said to himself.

　　The Countess fixed her eyes on Eugene, who stood stock still; all his faculties were numbed by this violent scene.

　　"Sir? . . ." she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and bearing; she took no notice now of her father nor of Delphine, who was hastily unfastening his waistcoat.

　　"Madame," said Eugene, answering the question before it was asked, "I will meet the bill, and keep silence about it."

　　"You have killed our father, Nasie!" said Delphine, pointing to Goriot, who lay unconscious on the bed. The Countess fled.

　　"I freely forgive her," said the old man, opening his eyes; "her position is horrible; it would turn an older head than hers. Comfort Nasie, and be nice to her, Delphine; promise it to your poor father before he dies," he asked, holding Delphine's hand in a convulsive clasp.

　　"Oh! what ails you, father?" she cried in real alarm.

　　"Nothing, nothing," said Goriot; "it will go off. There is something heavy pressing on my forehead, a little headache. . . . Ah! poor Nasie, what a life lies before her!"

　　Just as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on her knees before him. "Forgive me!" she cried.

　　"Come," said her father, "you are hurting me still more."

　　"Monsieur," the Countess said, turning to Rastignac, "misery made me unjust to you. You will be a brother to me, will you not?" and she held out her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke.

　　"Nasie," cried Delphine, flinging her arms round her sister, "my little Nasie, let us forget and forgive."

　　"No, no," cried Nasie; "I shall never forget!"

　　"Dear angels," cried Goriot, "it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes had been raised; your voices have called me back to life. Kiss each other once more. Well, now, Nasie, that bill will save you, won't it?"

　　"I hope so. I say, papa, will you write your name on it?"

　　"There! how stupid of me to forget that! But I am not feeling at all well, Nasie, so you must not remember it against me. Send and let me know as soon as you are out of your strait. No, I will go to you. No, after all, I will not go; I might meet your husband, and I should kill him on the spot. And as for signing away your property, I shall have a word to say about that. Quick, my child, and keep Maxime in order in future."

　　Eugene was too bewildered to speak.

　　"Poor Anastasie, she always had a violent temper," said Mme. de Nucingen, "but she has a good heart."

　　"She came back for the endorsement," said Eugene in Delphine's ear.

　　"Do you think so?"

　　"I only wish I could think otherwise. Do not trust her," he answered, raising his eyes as if he confided to heaven the thoughts that he did not venture to express.

　　"Yes. She is always acting a part to some extent."

　　"How do you feel now, dear Father Goriot?" asked Rastignac.

　　"I should like to go to sleep," he replied.

　　Eugene helped him to bed, and Delphine sat by the bedside, holding his hand until he fell asleep. Then she went.

　　"This evening at the Italiens," she said to Eugene, "and you can let me know how he is. To-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. Let us go into your room.--Oh! how frightful!" she cried on the threshold. "Why, you are even worse lodged than our father. Eugene, you have behaved well. I would love you more if that were possible; but, dear boy, if you are to succeed in life, you must not begin by flinging twelve thousand francs out of the windows like that. The Comte de Trailles is a confirmed gambler. My sister shuts her eyes to it. He would have made the twelve thousand francs in the same way that he wins and loses heaps of gold."

　　A groan from the next room brought them back to Goriot's bedside; to all appearances he was asleep, but the two lovers caught the words, "They are not happy!" Whether he was awake or sleeping, the tone in which they were spoken went to his daughter's heart. She stole up to the pallet-bed on which her father lay, and kissed his forehead. He opened his eyes.

　　"Ah! Delphine!" he said.

　　"How are you now?" she asked.

　　"Quite comfortable. Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently. Don't stay with me, children; go, go and be happy."

　　Eugene went back with Delphine as far as her door; but he was not easy about Goriot, and would not stay to dinner, as she proposed. He wanted to be back at the Maison Vauquer. Father Goriot had left his room, and was just sitting down to dinner as he came in. Bianchon had placed himself where he could watch the old man carefully; and when the old vermicelli maker took up his square of bread and smelled it to find out the quality of the flour, the medical student, studying him closely, saw that the action was purely mechanical, and shook his head.

　　"Just come and sit over here, hospitaller of Cochin," said Eugene.

　　Bianchon went the more willingly because his change of place brought him next to the old lodger.

　　"What is wrong with him?" asked Rastignac.

　　"It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! Something very extraordinary must have taken place; he looks to me as if he were in imminent danger of serous apoplexy. The lower part of his face is composed enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. Then there is that peculiar look about the eyes that indicates an effusion of serum in the brain; they look as though they were covered with a film of fine dust, do you notice? I shall know more about it by to-morrow morning."

　　"Is there any cure for it?"

　　"None. It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way could be found of setting up a reaction in the lower extremities; but if the symptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all over with him, poor old fellow! Do you know what has happened to bring this on? There must have been some violent shock, and his mind has given way."

　　"Yes, there was," said Rastignac, remembering how the two daughters had struck blow on blow at their father's heart.

　　"But Delphine at any rate loves her father," he said to himself.

　　That evening at the opera Rastignac chose his words carefully, lest he should give Mme. de Nucingen needless alarm.

　　"Do not be anxious about him," she said, however, as soon as Eugene began, "our father has really a strong constitution, but this morning we gave him a shock. Our whole fortunes were in peril, so the thing was serious, you see. I could not live if your affection did not make me insensible to troubles that I should once have thought too hard to bear. At this moment I have but one fear left, but one misery to dread--to lose the love that has made me feel glad to live. Everything else is as nothing to me compared with our love; I care for nothing else, for you are all the world to me. If I feel glad to be rich, it is for your sake. To my shame be it said, I think of my lover before my father. Do you ask why? I cannot tell you, but all my life is in you. My father gave me a heart, but you have taught it to beat. The whole world may condemn me; what does it matter if I stand acquitted in your eyes, for you have no right to think ill of me for the faults which a tyrannous love has forced me to commit for you! Do you think me an unnatural daughter? Oh! no, no one could help loving such a dear kind father as ours. But how could I hide the inevitable consequences of our miserable marriages from him? Why did he allow us to marry when we did? Was it not his duty to think for us and foresee for us? To-day I know he suffers as much as we do, but how can it be helped? And as for comforting him, we could not comfort him in the least. Our resignation would give him more pain and hurt him far more than complaints and upbraidings. There are times in life when everything turns to bitterness."

　　Eugene was silent, the artless and sincere outpouring made an impression on him.

　　Parisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and self-absorbed, frivolous and shallow; yet of all women, when they love, they sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they rise but so much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their nature, and become sublime. Then Eugene was struck by the profound discernment and insight displayed by this woman in judging of natural affection, when a privileged affection had separated and set her at a distance apart. Mme. de Nucingen was piqued by the silence,

　　"What are you thinking about?" she asked.

　　"I am thinking about what you said just now. Hitherto I have always felt sure that I cared far more for you than you did for me."

　　She smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest their talk should exceed the conventional limits of propriety. She had never heard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a few more words, and she feared for her self- control.

　　"Eugene," she said, changing the conversation, "I wonder whether you know what has been happening? All Paris will go to Mme. de Beauseant's to-morrow. The Rochefides and the Marquis d'Ajuda have agreed to keep the matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the marriage-contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing of it as yet. She cannot put off her ball, and the Marquis will not be there. People are wondering what will happen?"

　　"The world laughs at baseness and connives at it. But this will kill Mme. de Beauseant."

　　"Oh, no," said Delphine, smiling, "you do not know that kind of woman. Why, all Paris will be there, and so shall I; I ought to go there for your sake."

　　"Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set in circulation here."

　　"We shall know the truth to-morrow."

　　Eugene did not return to the Maison Vauquer. He could not forego the pleasure of occupying his new rooms in the Rue d'Artois. Yesterday evening he had been obliged to leave Delphine soon after midnight, but that night it was Delphine who stayed with him until two o'clock in the morning. He rose late, and waited for Mme. de Nucingen, who came about noon to breakfast with him. Youth snatches eagerly at these rosy moments of happiness, and Eugene had almost forgotten Goriot's existence. The pretty things that surrounded him were growing familiar; this domestication in itself was one long festival for him, and Mme. de Nucingen was there to glorify it all by her presence. It was four o'clock before they thought of Goriot, and of how he had looked forward to the new life in that house. Eugene said that the old man ought to be moved at once, lest he should grow too ill to move. He left Delphine and hurried back to the lodging-house. Neither Father Goriot nor young Bianchon was in the dining-room with the others.

　　"Aha!" said the painter as Eugene came in, "Father Goriot has broken down at last. Bianchon is upstairs with him. One of his daughters--the Comtesse de Restaurama--came to see the old gentleman, and he would get up and go out, and made himself worse. Society is about to lose one of its brightest ornaments."

　　Rastignac sprang to the staircase.

　　"Hey! Monsieur Eugene!"

　　"Monsieur Eugene, the mistress is calling you," shouted Sylvie.

　　"It is this, sir," said the widow. "You and M. Goriot should by rights have moved out on the 15th of February. That was three days ago; to-day is the 18th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but if you will engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied."

　　"Why can't you trust him?"

　　"Trust him, indeed! If the old gentleman went off his head and died, those daughters of his would not pay me a farthing, and his things won't fetch ten francs. This morning he went out with all the spoons and forks he has left, I don't know why. He had got himself up to look quite young, and--Lord, forgive me--but I thought he had rouge on his cheeks; he looked quite young again."

　　"I will be responsible," said Eugene, shuddering with horror, for he foresaw the end.

　　He climbed the stairs and reached Father Goriot's room. The old man was tossing on his bed. Bianchon was with him.

　　"Good-evening, father," said Eugene.

　　The old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said:

　　"How is SHE?"

　　"She is quite well. But how are you?"

　　"There is nothing much the matter."

　　"Don't tire him," said Bianchon, drawing Eugene into a corner of the room.

　　"Well?" asked Rastignac.

　　"Nothing but a miracle can save him now. Serous congestion has set in; I have put on mustard plasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are acting."

　　"Is it possible to move him?"

　　"Quite out of the question. He must stay where he is, and be kept as quiet as possible----"

　　"Dear Bianchon," said Eugene, "we will nurse him between us."

　　"I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him."

　　"And what did he say?"

　　"He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. He promised to look in again at the end of the day. Unluckily, the preposterous creature must needs go and do something foolish this morning; he will not say what it was. He is as obstinate as a mule. As soon as I begin to talk to him he pretends not to hear, and lies as if he were asleep instead of answering, or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. Some time this morning he went out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he went, and he took everything that he had of any value with him. He has been driving some confounded bargain, and it has been too much for his strength. One of his daughters has been here."

　　"Was it the Countess?" asked Eugene. "A tall, dark-haired woman, with large bright eyes, slender figure, and little feet?"

　　"Yes."

　　"Leave him to me for a bit," said Rastignac. "I will make him confess; he will tell me all about it."

　　"And meanwhile I will get my dinner. But try not to excite him; there is still some hope left."

　　"All right."

　　"How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow," said Father Goriot when they were alone. "They are going to a grand ball."

　　"What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so poorly this evening that you have to stop in bed?"

　　"Nothing."

　　"Did not Anastasie come to see you?" demanded Rastignac.

　　"Yes," said Father Goriot.

　　"Well, then, don't keep anything from me. What more did she want of you?"

　　"Oh, she was very miserable," he answered, gathering up all his strength to speak. "It was this way, my boy. Since that affair of the diamonds, Nasie has not had a penny of her own. For this ball she had ordered a golden gown like a setting for a jewel. Her mantuamaker, a woman without a conscience, would not give her credit, so Nasie's waiting-woman advanced a thousand francs on account. Poor Nasie! reduced to such shifts! It cut me to the heart to think of it! But when Nasie's maid saw how things were between her master and mistress, she was afraid of losing her money, and came to an understanding with the dressmaker, and the woman refuses to send the ball-dress until the money is paid. The gown is ready, and the ball is to-morrow night! Nasie was in despair. She wanted to borrow my forks and spoons to pawn them. Her husband is determined that she shall go and wear the diamonds, so as to contradict the stories that are told all over Paris. How can she go to that heartless scoundrel and say, 'I owe a thousand francs to my dressmaker; pay her for me!' She cannot. I saw that myself. Delphine will be there too in a superb toilette, and Anastasie ought not to be outshone by her younger sister. And then--she was drowned in tears, poor girl! I felt so humbled yesterday when I had not the twelve thousand francs, that I would have given the rest of my miserable life to wipe out that wrong. You see, I could have borne anything once, but latterly this want of money has broken my heart. Oh! I did not do it by halves; I titivated myself up a bit, and went out and sold my spoons and forks and buckles for six hundred francs; then I went to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a year's interest on my annuity for four hundred francs down. Pshaw! I can live on dry bread, as I did when I was a young man; if I have done it before, I can do it again. My Nasie shall have one happy evening, at any rate. She shall be smart. The banknote for a thousand francs is under my pillow; it warms me to have it lying there under my head, for it is going to make my poor Nasie happy. She can turn that bad girl Victoire out of the house. A servant that cannot trust her mistress, did any one ever hear the like! I shall be quite well to-morrow. Nasie is coming at ten o'clock. They must not think that I am ill, or they will not go to the ball; they will stop and take care of me. To-morrow Nasie will come and hold me in her arms as if I were one of her children; her kisses will make me well again. After all, I might have spent the thousand francs on physic; I would far rather give them to my little Nasie, who can charm all the pain away. At any rate, I am some comfort to her in her misery; and that makes up for my unkindness in buying an annuity. She is in the depths, and I cannot draw her out of them now. Oh! I will go into business again, I will buy wheat in Odessa; out there, wheat fetches a quarter of the price it sells for here. There is a law against the importation of grain, but the good folk who made the law forgot to prohibit the introduction of wheat products and food stuffs made from corn. Hey! hey! . . . That struck me this morning. There is a fine trade to be done in starch."

　　Eugene, watching the old man's face, thought that his friend was light-headed.

　　"Come," he said, "do not talk any more, you must rest----" Just then Bianchon came up, and Eugene went down to dinner.

　　The two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in turn. Bianchon brought up his medical books and studied; Eugene wrote letters home to his mother and sisters. Next morning Bianchon thought the symptoms more hopeful, but the patient's condition demanded continual attention, which the two students alone were willing to give--a task impossible to describe in the squeamish phraseology of the epoch. Leeches must be applied to the wasted body, the poultices and hot foot-baths, and other details of the treatment required the physical strength and devotion of the two young men. Mme. de Restaud did not come; but she sent a messenger for the money.

　　"I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for her to come, she would have been anxious about me," said the father, and to all appearances he was well content.

　　At seven o'clock that evening Therese came with a letter from Delphine.

　　"What are you doing, dear friend? I have been loved for a very   little while, and I am neglected already? In the confidences of   heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul--you are too   noble not to be faithful for ever, for you know that love with   all its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the same.   Once you said, as we were listening to the Prayer in Mose in   Egitto, 'For some it is the monotony of a single note; for   others, it is the infinite of sound.' Remember that I am   expecting you this evening to take me to Mme. de Beauseant's   ball. Every one knows now that the King signed M. d'Ajuda's   marriage-contract this morning, and the poor Vicomtesse knew   nothing of it until two o'clock this afternoon. All Paris will   flock to her house, of course, just as a crowd fills the Place de   Greve to see an execution. It is horrible, is it not, to go out   of curiosity to see if she will hide her anguish, and whether she   will die courageously? I certainly should not go, my friend, if I   had been at her house before; but, of course, she will not   receive society any more after this, and all my efforts would be   in vain. My position is a very unusual one, and besides, I am   going there partly on your account. I am waiting for you. If you   are not beside me in less than two hours, I do not know whether I   could forgive such treason."

　　Rastignac took up a pen and wrote:

　　"I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope   of your father's life. He is lying dangerously ill. I will come   and bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of   death. When I come you can decide whether you can go to the   ball.--Yours a thousand times."

　　At half-past eight the doctor arrived. He did not take a very hopeful view of the case, but thought that there was no immediate danger. Improvements and relapses might be expected, and the good man's life and reason hung in the balance.

　　"It would be better for him to die at once," the doctor said as he took leave.

　　Eugene left Goriot to Bianchon's care, and went to carry the sad news to Mme. de Nucingen. Family feeling lingered in her, and this must put an end for the present to her plans of amusement.

　　"Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened," cried Goriot. He had been lying in a sort of stupor, but he suddenly sat upright as Eugene went out.

　　Eugene, half heartbroken, entered Delphine's. Her hair had been dressed; she wore her dancing slippers; she had only to put on her ball-dress; but when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his creation, the last touches require more time than the whole groundwork of the picture.

　　"Why, you are not dressed!" she cried.

　　"Madame, your father----"

　　"My father again!" she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. "You need not teach me what is due to my father, I have known my father this long while. Not a word, Eugene. I will hear what you have to say when you are dressed. My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms and dress, Therese has put out everything in readiness for you. Come back as soon as you can; we will talk about my father on the way to Mme. de Beauseant's. We must go early; if we have to wait our turn in a row of carriages, we shall be lucky if we get there by eleven o'clock."

　　"Madame----"

　　"Quick! not a word!" she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a necklace.

　　"Do go, Monsieur Eugene, or you will vex madame," said Therese, hurrying him away; and Eugene was too horror-stricken by this elegant parricide to resist.

　　He went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. The world of Paris was like an ocean of mud for him just then; and it seemed that whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink into it up to the chin.

　　"Their crimes are paltry," said Eugene to himself. "Vautrin was greater."

　　He had seen society in its three great phases--Obedience, Struggle, and Revolt; the Family, the World, and Vautrin; and he hesitated in his choice. Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle hazardous. His thoughts wandered back to the home circle. He thought of the quiet uneventful life, the pure happiness of the days spent among those who loved him there. Those loving and beloved beings passed their lives in obedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience found a deep and constant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these. Yet, for all his good impulses, he could not bring himself to make profession of the religion of pure souls to Delphine, nor to prescribe the duties of piety to her in the name of love. His education had begun to bear its fruits; he loved selfishly already. Besides, his tact had discovered to him the real nature of Delphine; he divined instinctively that she was capable of stepping over her father's corpse to go to the ball; and within himself he felt that he had neither the strength of mind to play the part of mentor, nor the strength of character to vex her, nor the courage to leave her to go alone.

　　"She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it," he said to himself. Then he turned the doctor's dictum over in his mind; he tried to believe that Goriot was not so dangerously ill as he had imagined, and ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of traitorous excuses for Delphine's conduct. She did not know how ill her father was; the kind old man himself would have made her go to the ball if she had gone to see him. So often it happens that this one or that stands condemned by the social laws that govern family relations; and yet there are peculiar circumstances in the case, differences of temperament, divergent interests, innumerable complications of family life that excuse the apparent offence.

　　Eugene did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his conscience to his mistress. Within the last few days his whole life had undergone a change. Woman had entered into his world and thrown it into chaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had appropriated all his being to her uses. Rastignac and Delphine found each other at a crisis in their lives when their union gave them the most poignant bliss. Their passion, so long proved, had only gained in strength by the gratified desire that often extinguishes passion. This woman was his, and Eugene recognized that not until then had he loved her; perhaps love is only gratitude for pleasure. This woman, vile or sublime, he adored for the pleasure she had brought as her dower; and Delphine loved Rastignac as Tantalus would have loved some angel who had satisfied his hunger and quenched the burning thirst in his parched throat.

　　"Well," said Mme. de Nucingen when he came back in evening dress, "how is my father?"

　　"Very dangerously ill," he answered; "if you will grant me a proof of your affections, we will just go in to see him on the way."

　　"Very well," she said. "Yes, but afterwards. Dear Eugene, do be nice, and don't preach to me. Come."

　　They set out. Eugene said nothing for a while.

　　"What is it now?" she asked.

　　"I can hear the death-rattle in your father's throat," he said almost angrily. And with the hot indignation of youth, he told the story of Mme. de Restaud's vanity and cruelty, of her father's final act of self-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life and death, of the price that had been paid for Anastasie's golden embroideries. Delphine cried.

　　"I shall look frightful," she thought. She dried her tears.

　　"I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside," she said aloud.

　　"Ah! now you are as I would have you," exclaimed Rastignac.

　　The lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the Hotel de Beauseant. A gendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood on either side of the brightly lighted gateway. The great world was flocking thither that night in its eager curiosity to see the great lady at the moment of her fall, and the rooms on the ground floor were already full to overflowing, when Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac appeared. Never since Louis XIV. tore her lover away from La grand Mademoiselle, and the whole court hastened to visit that unfortunate princess, had a disastrous love affair made such a sensation in Paris. But the youngest daughter of the almost royal house of Burgundy had risen proudly above her pain, and moved till the last moment like a queen in this world--its vanities had always been valueless for her, save in so far as they contributed to the triumph of her passion. The salons were filled with the most beautiful women in Paris, resplendent in their toilettes, and radiant with smiles. Ministers and ambassadors, the most distinguished men at court, men bedizened with decorations, stars, and ribbons, men who bore the most illustrious names in France, had gathered about the Vicomtesse.

　　The music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from the golden ceiling of the palace, now made desolate for its queen.

　　Madame de Beauseant stood at the door of the first salon to receive the guests who were styled her friends. She was dressed in white, and wore no ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head; her face was calm; there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of joy that she did not feel. No one could read her soul; she stood there like some Niobe carved in marble. For a few intimate friends there was a tinge of satire in her smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her, nor had she looked otherwise in the days of the glory of her happiness. The most callous of her guests admired her as young Rome applauded some gladiator who could die smiling. It seemed as if society had adorned itself for a last audience of one of its sovereigns.

　　"I was afraid that you would not come," she said to Rastignac.

　　"Madame," he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a reproach, "I shall be the last to go, that is why I am here."

　　"Good," she said, and she took his hand. "You are perhaps the only one I can trust here among all these. Oh, my friend, when you love, love a woman whom you are sure that you can love always. Never forsake a woman."

　　She took Rastignac's arm, and went towards a sofa in the card- room.

　　"I want you to go to the Marquis," she said. "Jacques, my footman, will go with you; he has a letter that you will take. I am asking the Marquis to give my letters back to me. He will give them all up, I like to think that. When you have my letters, go up to my room with them. Some one shall bring me word."

　　She rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Langeais, her most intimate friend, who had come like the rest of the world.

　　Rastignac went. He asked for the Marquis d'Ajuda at the Hotel Rochefide, feeling certain that the latter would be spending his evening there, and so it proved. The Marquis went to his own house with Rastignac, and gave a casket to the student, saying as he did so, "They are all there."

　　He seemed as if he was about to say something to Eugene, to ask about the ball, or the Vicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of the confession that, even then, he was in despair, and knew that his marriage had been a fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his eyes, and with deplorable courage he kept his noblest feelings a secret.

　　"Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Eugene." He grasped Rastignac's hand sadly and affectionately, and turned away from him. Eugene went back to the Hotel Beauseant, the servant took him to the Vicomtesse's room. There were signs there of preparations for a journey. He sat down by the fire, fixed his eyes on the cedar wood casket, and fell into deep mournful musings. Mme. de Beauseant loomed large in these imaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad.

　　"Ah! my friend! . . ." said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and laid her hand on Rastignac's shoulder. He saw the tears in his cousin's uplifted eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the casket, and that the fingers of the other trembled. Suddenly she took the casket, put it in the fire, and watched it burn.

　　"They are dancing," she said. "They all came very early; but death will be long in coming. Hush! my friend," and she laid a finger on Rastignac's lips, seeing that he was about to speak. "I shall never see Paris again. I am taking my leave of the world. At five o'clock this morning I shall set out on my journey; I mean to bury myself in the remotest part of Normandy. I have had very little time to make my arrangements; since three o'clock this afternoon I have been busy signing documents, setting my affairs in order; there was no one whom I could send to . . ."

　　She broke off.

　　"He was sure to be . . ."

　　Again she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could bear. In such moments as these everything is agony, and some words are impossible to utter.

　　"And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this evening," she said. "I should like to give you some pledge of friendship. I shall often think of you. You have seemed to me to be kind and noble, fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such qualities are seldom found. I should like you to think sometimes of me. Stay," she said, glancing about her, "there is this box that has held my gloves. Every time I opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre, I used to feel that I must be beautiful, because I was so happy; and I never touched it except to lay some gracious memory in it: there is so much of my old self in it, of a Madame de Beauseant who now lives no longer. Will you take it? I will leave directions that it is to be sent to you in the Rue d'Artois.--Mme. de Nucingen looked very charming this evening. Eugene, you must love her. Perhaps we may never see each other again, my friend; but be sure of this, that I shall pray for you who have been kind to me.--Now, let us go downstairs. People shall not think that I am weeping. I have all time and eternity before me, and where I am going I shall be alone, and no one will ask me the reason of my tears. One last look round first."

　　She stood for a moment. Then she covered her eyes with her hands for an instant, dashed away the tears, bathed her face with cold water, and took the student's arm.

　　"Let us go!" she said.

　　This suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Eugene with a more violent emotion than he had felt before. They went back to the ballroom, and Mme. de Beauseant went through the rooms on Eugene's arm--the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. In another moment he saw the sisters, Mme. de Restaud and Mme. de Nucingen. The Countess shone in all the glory of her magnificent diamonds; every stone must have scorched like fire, she was never to wear them again. Strong as love and pride might be in her, she found it difficult to meet her husband's eyes. The sight of her was scarcely calculated to lighten Rastignac's sad thougths; through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed to see the wretched pallet-bed on which Father Goriot was lying. The Vicomtesse misread his melancholy; she withdrew her hand from his arm.

　　"Come," she said, "I must not deprive you of a pleasure."

　　Eugene was soon claimed by Delphine. She was delighted by the impression that she had made, and eager to lay at her lover's feet the homage she had received in this new world in which she hoped to live and move henceforth.

　　"What do you think of Nasie?" she asked him.

　　"She has discounted everything, even her own father's death," said Rastignac.

　　Towards four o'clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. A little later the music ceased, and the Duchesse de Langeais and Rastignac were left in the great ballroom. The Vicomtesse, who thought to find the student there alone, came back there at last. She had taken leave of M. de Beauseant, who had gone off to bed, saying again as he went, "It is a great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your age! Pray stay among us."

　　Mme. de Beauseant saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an exclamation broke from her.

　　"I saw how it was, Clara," said Mme. de Langeais. "You are going from among us, and you will never come back. But you must not go until you have heard me, until we have understood each other."

　　She took her friend's arm, and they went together into the next room. There the Duchess looked at her with tears in her eyes; she held her friend in close embrace and kissed her cheek.

　　"I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the remorse would have been too hard to bear. You can count upon me as surely as upon yourself. You have shown yourself great this evening; I feel that I am worthy of our friendship, and I mean to prove myself worthy of it. I have not always been kind; I was in the wrong; forgive me, dearest; I wish I could unsay anything that may have hurt you; I take back those words. One common sorrow has brought us together again, for I do not know which of us is the more miserable. M. de Montriveau was not here to-night; do you understand what that means?--None of those who saw you to-night, Clara, will ever forget you. I mean to make one last effort. If I fail, I shall go into a convent. Clara, where are you going?"

　　"Into Normandy, to Courcelles. I shall love and pray there until the day when God shall take me from this world.--M. de Rastignac!" called the Vicomtesse, in a tremulous voice, remembering that the young man was waiting there.

　　The student knelt to kiss his cousin's hand.

　　"Good-bye, Antoinette!" said Mme. de Beauseant. "May you be happy."--She turned to the student. "You are young," she said; "you have some beliefs still left. I have been privileged, like some dying people, to find sincere and reverent feeling in those about me as I take my leave of this world."

　　It was nearly five o'clock that morning when Rastignac came away. He had put Mme. de Beauseant into her traveling carriage, and received her last farewells, spoken amid fast-falling tears; for no greatness is so great that it can rise above the laws of human affection, or live beyond the jurisdiction of pain, as certain demagogues would have the people believe. Eugene returned on foot to the Maison Vauquer through the cold and darkness. His education was nearly complete.

　　"There is no hope for poor Father Goriot," said Bianchon, as Rastignac came into the room. Eugene looked for a while at the sleeping man, then he turned to his friend. "Dear fellow, you are content with the modest career you have marked out for yourself; keep to it. I am in hell, and I must stay there. Believe everything that you hear said of the world, nothing is too impossibly bad. No Juvenal could paint the horrors hidden away under the covering of gems and gold."

　　At two o'clock in the afternoon Bianchon came to wake Rastignac, and begged him to take charge of Goriot, who had grown worse as the day wore on. The medical student was obliged to go out.

　　"Poor old man, he has not two days to live, maybe not many hours," he said; "but we must do our utmost, all the same, to fight the disease. It will be a very troublesome case, and we shall want money. We can nurse him between us, of course, but, for my own part, I have not a penny. I have turned out his pockets, and rummaged through his drawers--result, nix. I asked him about it while his mind was clear, and he told me he had not a farthing of his own. What have you?"

　　"I have twenty francs left," said Rastignac; "but I will take them to the roulette table, I shall be sure to win."

　　"And if you lose?"

　　"Then I shall go to his sons-in-law and his daughters and ask them for money."

　　"And suppose they refuse?" Bianchon retorted. "The most pressing thing just now is not really money; we must put mustard poultices, as hot as they can be made, on his feet and legs. If he calls out, there is still some hope for him. You know how to set about doing it, and besides, Christophe will help you. I am going round to the dispensary to persuade them to let us have the things we want on credit. It is a pity that we could not move him to the hospital; poor fellow, he would be better there. Well, come along, I leave you in charge; you must stay with him till I come back."

　　The two young men went back to the room where the old man was lying. Eugene was startled at the change in Goriot's face, so livid, distorted, and feeble.

　　"How are you, papa?" he said, bending over the pallet-bed. Goriot turned his dull eyes upon Eugene, looked at him attentively, and did not recognize him. It was more than the student could bear; the tears came into his eyes.

　　"Bianchon, ought we to have the curtains put up in the windows?"

　　"No, the temperature and the light do not affect him now. It would be a good thing for him if he felt heat or cold; but we must have a fire in any case to make tisanes and heat the other things. I will send round a few sticks; they will last till we can have in some firewood. I burned all the bark fuel you had left, as well as his, poor man, yesterday and during the night. The place is so damp that the water stood in drops on the walls; I could hardly get the room dry. Christophe came in and swept the floor, but the place is like a stable; I had to burn juniper, the smell was something horrible.

　　"MON DIEU!" said Rastignac. "To think of those daughters of his."

　　"One moment, if he asks for something to drink, give him this," said the house student, pointing to a large white jar. "If he begins to groan, and the belly feels hot and hard to the touch, you know what to do; get Christophe to help you. If he should happen to grow much excited, and begin to talk a good deal and even to ramble in his talk, do not be alarmed. It would not be a bad symptom. But send Christophe to the Hospice Cochin. Our doctor, my chum, or I will come and apply moxas. We had a great consultation this morning while you were asleep. A surgeon, a pupil of Gall's came, and our house surgeon, and the head physician from the Hotel-Dieu. Those gentlemen considered that the symptoms were very unusual and interesting; the case must be carefully watched, for it throws a light on several obscure and rather important scientific problems. One of the authorities says that if there is more pressure of serum on one or other portion of the brain, it should affect his mental capacities in such and such directions. So if he should talk, notice very carefully what kind of ideas his mind seems to run on; whether memory, or penetration, or the reasoning faculties are exercised; whether sentiments or practical questions fill his thoughts; whether he makes forecasts or dwells on the past; in fact; you must be prepared to give an accurate report of him. It is quite likely that the extravasation fills the whole brain, in which case he will die in the imbecile state in which he is lying now. You cannot tell anything about these mysterious nervous diseases. Suppose the crash came here," said Bianchon, touching the back of the head, "very strange things have been known to happen; the brain sometimes partially recovers, and death is delayed. Or the congested matter may pass out of the brain altogether through channels which can only be determined by a post-mortem examination. There is an old man at the Hospital for Incurables, an imbecile patient, in his case the effusion has followed the direction of the spinal cord; he suffers horrid agonies, but he lives."

　　"Did they enjoy themselves?" It was Father Goriot who spoke. He had recognized Eugene.

　　"Oh! he thinks of nothing but his daughters," said Bianchon. "Scores of times last night he said to me, 'They are dancing now! She has her dress.' He called them by their names. He made me cry, the devil take it, calling with that tone in his voice, for 'Delphine! my little Delphine! and Nasie!' Upon my word," said the medical student, "it was enough to make any one burst out crying."

　　"Delphine," said the old man, "she is there, isn't she? I knew she was there," and his eyes sought the door.

　　"I am going down now to tell Sylvie to get the poultices ready," said Bianchon. "They ought to go on at once."

　　Rastignac was left alone with the old man. He sat at the foot of the bed, and gazed at the face before him, so horribly changed that it was shocking to see.

　　"Noble natures cannot dwell in this world," he said; "Mme de Beauseant has fled from it, and there he lies dying. What place indeed is there in the shallow petty frivolous thing called society for noble thoughts and feelings?"

　　Pictures of yesterday's ball rose up in his memory, in strange contrast to the deathbed before him. Bianchon suddenly appeared.

　　"I say, Eugene, I have just seen our head surgeon at the hospital, and I ran all the way back here. If the old man shows any signs of reason, if he begins to talk, cover him with a mustard poultice from the neck to the base of the spine, and send round for us."

　　"Dear Bianchon," exclaimed Eugene.

　　"Oh! it is an interesting case from a scientific point of view," said the medical student, with all the enthusiasm of a neophyte.

　　"So!" said Eugene. "Am I really the only one who cares for the poor old man for his own sake?"

　　"You would not have said so if you had seen me this morning," returned Bianchon, who did not take offence at this speech. "Doctors who have seen a good deal of practice never see anything but the disease, but, my dear fellow, I can see the patient still."

　　He went. Eugene was left alone with the old man, and with an apprehension of a crisis that set in, in fact, before very long.

　　"Ah! dear boy, is that you?" said Father Goriot, recognizing Eugene.

　　"Do you feel better?" asked the law student, taking his hand.

　　"Yes. My head felt as if it were being screwed up in a vise, but now it is set free again. Did you see my girls? They will be here directly; as soon as they know that I am ill they will hurry here at once; they used to take such care of me in the Rue de la Jussienne! Great Heavens! if only my room was fit for them to come into! There has been a young man here, who has burned up all my bark fuel."

　　"I can hear Christophe coming upstairs," Eugene answered. "He is bringing up some firewood that that young man has sent you."

　　"Good, but how am I to pay for the wood. I have not a penny left, dear boy. I have given everything, everything. I am a pauper now. Well, at least the golden gown was grand, was it not? (Ah! what pain this is!) Thanks, Christophe! God will reward you, my boy; I have nothing left now."

　　Eugene went over to Christophe and whispered in the man's ear, "I will pay you well, and Sylvie too, for your trouble."

　　"My daughters told you that they were coming, didn't they, Christophe? Go again to them, and I will give you five francs. Tell them that I am not feeling well, that I should like to kiss them both and see them once again before I die. Tell them that, but don't alarm them more than you can help."

　　Rastignac signed to Christophe to go, and the man went.

　　"They will come before long," the old man went on. "I know them so well. My tender-hearted Delphine! If I am going to die, she will feel it so much! And so will Nasie. I do not want to die; they will cry if I die; and if I die, dear Eugene, I shall not see them any more. It will be very dreary there where I am going. For a father it is hell to be without your children; I have served my apprenticeship already since they married. My heaven was in the Rue de la Jussienne. Eugene, do you think that if I go to heaven I can come back to earth, and be near them in spirit? I have heard some such things said. It is true? It is as if I could see them at this moment as they used to be when we all lived in the Rue de la Jussienne. They used to come downstairs of a morning. 'Good-morning, papa!' they used to say, and I would take them on my knees; we had all sorts of little games of play together, and they had such pretty coaxing ways. We always had breakfast together, too, every morning, and they had dinner with me--in fact, I was a father then. I enjoyed my children. They did not think for themselves so long as they lived in the Rue de la Jussienne; they knew nothing of the world; they loved me with all their hearts. MON DIEU! why could they not always be little girls? (Oh! my head! this racking pain in my head!) Ah! ah! forgive me, children, this pain is fearful; it must be agony indeed, for you have used me to endure pain. MON DIEU! if only I held their hands in mine, I should not feel it at all.--Do you think that they are on the way? Christophe is so stupid; I ought to have gone myself. HE will see them. But you went to the ball yesterday; just tell me how they looked. They did not know that I was ill, did they, or they would not have been dancing, poor little things? Oh! I must not be ill any longer. They stand too much in need of me; their fortunes are in danger. And such husbands as they are bound to! I must get well! (Oh! what pain this is! what pain this is! . . . ah! ah!)--I must get well, you see; for they MUST have money, and I know how to set about making some. I will go to Odessa and manufacture starch there. I am an old hand, I will make millions. (Oh! this is agony!)"

　　Goriot was silent for a moment; it seemed to require his whole strength to endure the pain.

　　"If they were here, I should not complain," he said. "So why should I complain now?"

　　He seemed to grow drowsy with exhaustion, and lay quietly for a long time. Christophe came back; and Rastignac, thinking that Goriot was asleep, allowed the man to give his story aloud.

　　"First of all, sir, I went to Madame la Comtesse," he said; "but she and her husband were so busy that I couldn't get to speak to her. When I insisted that I must see her, M. de Restaud came out to me himself, and went on like this: 'M. Goriot is dying, is he? Very well, it is the best thing he can do. I want Mme. de Restaud to transact some important business, when it is all finished she can go.' The gentleman looked angry, I thought. I was just going away when Mme. de Restaud came out into an ante-chamber through a door that I did not notice, and said, 'Christophe, tell my father that my husband wants me to discuss some matters with him, and I cannot leave the house, the life or death of my children is at stake; but as soon as it is over, I will come.' As for Madame la Baronne, that is another story! I could not speak to her either, and I did not even see her. Her waiting-woman said, 'Ah yes, but madame only came back from a ball at a quarter to five this morning; she is asleep now, and if I wake her before mid-day she will be cross. As soon as she rings, I will go and tell her that her father is worse. It will be time enough then to tell her bad news!' I begged and I prayed, but, there! it was no good. Then I asked for M. le Baron, but he was out."

　　"To think that neither of his daughters should come!" exclaimed Rastignac. "I will write to them both."

　　"Neither of them!" cried the old man, sitting upright in bed. "They are busy, they are asleep, they will not come! I knew that they would not. Not until you are dying do you know your children. . . . Oh! my friend, do not marry; do not have children! You give them life; they give you your deathblow. You bring them into the world, and they send you out of it. No, they will not come. I have known that these ten years. Sometimes I have told myself so, but I did not dare to believe it."

　　The tears gathered and stood without overflowing the red sockets.

　　"Ah! if I were rich still, if I had kept my money, if I had not given all to them, they would be with me now; they would fawn on me and cover my cheeks with their kisses! I should be living in a great mansion; I should have grand apartments and servants and a fire in my room; and THEY would be about me all in tears, and their husbands and their children. I should have had all that; now--I have nothing. Money brings everything to you; even your daughters. My money. Oh! where is my money? If I had plenty of money to leave behind me, they would nurse me and tend me; I should hear their voices, I should see their faces. Ah, God! who knows? They both of them have hearts of stone. I loved them too much; it was not likely that they should love me. A father ought always to be rich; he ought to keep his children well in hand, like unruly horses. I have gone down on my knees to them. Wretches! this is the crowning act that brings the last ten years to a proper close. If you but knew how much they made of me just after they were married. (Oh! this is cruel torture!) I had just given them each eight hundred thousand francs; they were bound to be civil to me after that, and their husbands too were civil. I used to go to their houses: it was 'My kind father' here, 'My dear father' there. There was always a place for me at their tables. I used to dine with their husbands now and then, and they were very respectful to me. I was still worth something, they thought. How should they know? I had not said anything about my affairs. It is worth while to be civil to a man who has given his daughters eight hundred thousand francs apiece; and they showed me every attention then--but it was all for my money. Grand people are not great. I found that out by experience! I went to the theatre with them in their carriage; I might stay as long as I cared to stay at their evening parties. In fact, they acknowleged me their father; publicly they owned that they were my daughters. But I was always a shrewd one, you see, and nothing was lost upon me. Everything went straight to the mark and pierced my heart. I saw quite well that it was all sham and pretence, but there is no help for such things as these. I felt less at my ease at their dinner-table than I did downstairs here. I had nothing to say for myself. So these grand folks would ask in my son-in-law's ear, 'Who may that gentleman be?'--'The father-in-law with the money bags; he is very rich.'--'The devil, e is!' they would say, and look again at me with the respect due to my money. Well, if I was in the way sometimes, I paid dearly for my mistakes. And besides, who is perfect? (My head is one sore!) Dear Monsieur Eugene, I am suffering so now, that a man might die of the pain; but it is nothing to be compared with the pain I endured when Anastasie made me feel, for the first time, that I had said something stupid. She looked at me, and that glance of hers opened all my veins. I used to want to know everything, to be learned; and one thing I did learn thoroughly --I knew that I was not wanted here on earth.

　　"The next day I went to Delphine for comfort, and what should I do there but make some stupid blunder that made her angry with me. I was like one driven out of his senses. For a week I did not know what to do; I did not dare to go to see them for fear they should reproach me. And that was how they both turned me out of the house.

　　"Oh God! Thou knowest all the misery and anguish that I have endured; Thou hast counted all the wounds that have been dealt to me in these years that have aged and changed me and whitened my hair and drained my life; why dost Thou make me to suffer so to- day? Have I not more than expiated the sin of loving them too much? They themselves have been the instruments of vengeance; they have tortured me for my sin of affection.

　　"Ah, well! fathers know no better; I loved them so; I went back to them as a gambler goes to the gaming table. This love was my vice, you see, my mistress--they were everything in the world to me. They were always wanting something or other, dresses and ornaments, and what not; their maids used to tell me what they wanted, and I used to give them the things for the sake of the welcome that they bought for me. But, at the same time, they used to give me little lectures on my behavior in society; they began about it at once. Then they began to feel ashamed of me. That is what comes of having your children well brought up. I could not go to school again at my time of life. (This pain is fearful! MON DIEU! These doctors! these doctors! If they would open my head, it would give me some relief!) Oh, my daughters, my daughters! Anastasie! Delphine! If I could only see them! Send for the police, and make them come to me! Justice is on my side, the whole world is on my side, I have natural rights, and the law with me. I protest! The country will go to ruin if a father's rights are trampled under foot. That is easy to see. The whole world turns on fatherly love; fatherly love is the foundation of society; it will crumble into ruin when children do not love their fathers. Oh! if I could only see them, and hear them, no matter what they said; if I could simply hear their voices, it would soothe the pain. Delphine! Delphine most of all. But tell them when they come not to look so coldly at me as they do. Oh! my friend, my good Monsieur Eugene, you do not know that it is when all the golden light in a glance suddenly turns to a leaden gray. It has been one long winter here since the light in their eyes shone no more for me. I have had nothing but disappointments to devour. Disappointment has been my daily bread; I have lived on humiliation and insults. I have swallowed down all the affronts for which they sold me my poor stealthy little moments of joy; for I love them so! Think of it! a father hiding himself to get a glimpse of his children! I have given all my life to them, and to-day they will not give me one hour! I am hungering and thirsting for them, my heart is burning in me, but they will not come to bring relief in the agony, for I am dying now, I feel that this is death. Do they not know what it means to trample on a father's corpse? There is a God in heaven who avenges us fathers whether we will or no.

　　"Oh! they will come! Come to me, darlings, and give me one more kiss; one last kiss, the Viaticum for your father, who will pray God for you in heaven. I will tell Him that you have been good children to your father, and plead your cause with God! After all, it is not their fault. I tell you they are innocent, my friend. Tell every one that it is not their fault, and no one need be distressed on my account. It is all my own fault, I taught them to trample upon me. I loved to have it so. It is no one's affair but mine; man's justice and God's justice have nothing to do in it. God would be unjust if He condemned them for anything they may have done to me. I did not behave to them properly; I was stupid enough to resign my rights. I would have humbled myself in the dust for them. What could you expect? The most beautiful nature, the noblest soul, would have been spoiled by such indulgence. I am a wretch, I am justly punished. I, and I only, am to blame for all their sins; I spoiled them. To-day they are as eager for pleasure as they used to be for sugar-plums. When they were little girls I indulged them in every whim. They had a carriage of their own when they were fifteen. They have never been crossed. I am guilty, and not they--but I sinned through love.

　　"My heart would open at the sound of their voices. I can hear them; they are coming. Yes! yes! they are coming. The law demands that they should be present at their father's deathbed; the law is on my side. It would only cost them the hire of a cab. I would pay that. Write to them, tell them that I have millions to leave to them! On my word of honor, yes. I am going to manufacture Italian paste foods at Odessa. I understand the trade. There are millions to be made in it. Nobody has thought of the scheme as yet. You see, there will be no waste, no damage in transit, as there always is with wheat and flour. Hey! hey! and starch too; there are millions to be made in the starch trade! You will not be telling a lie. Millions, tell them; and even if they really come because they covet the money, I would rather let them deceive me; and I shall see them in any case. I want my children! I gave them life; they are mine, mine!" and he sat upright. The head thus raised, with its scanty white hair, seemed to Eugene like a threat; every line that could still speak spoke of menace.

　　"There, there, dear father," said Eugene, "lie down again; I will write to them at once. As soon as Bianchon comes back I will go for them myself, if they do not come before."

　　"If they do not come?" repeated the old man, sobbing. "Why, I shall be dead before then; I shall die in a fit of rage, of rage! Anger is getting the better of me. I can see my whole life at this minute. I have been cheated! They do not love me--they have never loved me all their lives! It is all clear to me. They have not come, and they will not come. The longer they put off their coming, the less they are likely to give me this joy. I know them. They have never cared to guess my disappointments, my sorrows, my wants; they never cared to know my life; they will have no presentiment of my death; they do not even know the secret of my tenderness for them. Yes, I see it all now. I have laid my heart open so often, that they take everything I do for them as a matter of course. They might have asked me for the very eyes out of my head and I would have bidden them to pluck them out. They think that all fathers are like theirs. You should always make your value felt. Their own children will avenge me. Why, for their own sakes they should come to me! Make them understand that they are laying up retribution for their own deathbeds. All crimes are summed up in this one. . . . Go to them; just tell them that if they stay away it will be parricide! There is enough laid to their charge already without adding that to the list. Cry aloud as I do now, 'Nasie! Delphine! here! Come to your father; the father who has been so kind to you is lying ill!'--Not a sound; no one comes! Then am I do die like a dog? This is to be my reward--I am forsaken at the last. They are wicked, heartless women; curses on them, I loathe them. I shall rise at night from my grave to curse them again; for, after all, my friends, have I done wrong? They are behaving very badly to me, eh? . . . What am I saying? Did you not tell me just now that Delphine is in the room? She is more tender-hearted than her sister. . . . Eugene, you are my son, you know. You will love her; be a father to her! Her sister is very unhappy. And there are their fortunes! Ah, God! I am dying, this anguish is almost more than I can bear! Cut off my head; leave me nothing but my heart."

　　"Christophe!" shouted Eugene, alarmed by the way in which the old man moaned, and by his cries, "go for M. Bianchon, and send a cab here for me.--I am going to fetch them, dear father; I will bring them back to you."

　　"Make them come! Compel them to come! Call out the Guard, the military, anything and everything, but make them come!" He looked at Eugene, and a last gleam of intelligence shone in his eyes. "Go to the authorities, to the Public Prosecutor, let them bring them here; come they shall!"

　　"But you have cursed them."

　　"Who said that!" said the old man in dull amazement. "You know quite well that I love them, I adore them! I shall be quite well again if I can see them. . . . Go for them, my good neighbor, my dear boy, you are kind-hearted; I wish I could repay you for your kindness, but I have nothing to give you now, save the blessing of a dying man. Ah! if I could only see Delphine, to tell her to pay my debt to you. If the other cannot come, bring Delphine to me at any rate. Tell her that unless she comes, you will not love her any more. She is so fond of you that she will come to me then. Give me something to drink! There is a fire in my bowels. Press something against my forehead! If my daughters would lay their hands there, I think I should get better. . . . MON DIEU! who will recover their money for them when I am gone? . . . I will manufacture vermicelli out in Odessa; I will go to Odessa for their sakes."

　　"Here is something to drink," said Eugene, supporting the dying man on his left arm, while he held a cup of tisane to Goriot's lips.

　　"How you must love your own father and mother!" said the old man, and grasped the student's hand in both of his. It was a feeble, trembling grasp. "I am going to die; I shall die without seeing my daughters; do you understand? To be always thirsting, and never to drink; that has been my life for the last ten years. . . . I have no daughters, my sons-in-law killed them. No, since their marriages they have been dead to me. Fathers should petition the Chambers to pass a law against marriage. If you love your daughters, do not let them marry. A son-in-law is a rascal who poisons a girl's mind and contaminates her whole nature. Let us have no more marriages! It robs us of our daughters; we are left alone upon our deathbeds, and they are not with us then. They ought to pass a law for dying fathers. This is awful! It cries for vengeance! They cannot come, because my sons-in-law forbid them! . . . Kill them! . . . Restaud and the Alsatian, kill them both! They have murdered me between them! . . . Death or my daughters! . . . Ah! it is too late, I am dying, and they are not here! . . . Dying without them! . . . Nasie! Fifine! Why do you not come to me? Your papa is going----"

　　"Dear Father Goriot, calm yourself. There, there, lie quietly and rest; don't worry yourself, don't think."

　　"I shall not see them. Oh! the agony of it!"

　　"You SHALL see them."

　　"Really?" cried the old man, still wandering. "Oh! shall I see them; I shall see them and hear their voices. I shall die happy. Ah! well, after all, I do not wish to live; I cannot stand this much longer; this pain that grows worse and worse. But, oh! to see them, to touch their dresses--ah! nothing but their dresses, that is very little; still, to feel something that belongs to them. Let me touch their hair with my fingers . . . their hair . . ."

　　His head fell back on the pillow, as if a sudden heavy blow had struck him down, but his hands groped feebly over the quilt, as if to find his daughters' hair.

　　"My blessing on them . . ." he said, making an effort, "my blessing . . ."

　　His voice died away. Just at that moment Bianchon came into the room.

　　"I met Christophe," he said; "he is gone for your cab."

　　Then he looked at the patient, and raised the closed eyelids with his fingers. The two students saw how dead and lustreless the eyes beneath had grown.

　　"He will not get over this, I am sure," said Bianchon. He felt the old man's pulse, and laid a hand over his heart.

　　"The machinery works still; more is the pity, in his state it would be better for him to die."

　　"Ah! my word, it would!"

　　"What is the matter with you? You are as pale as death."

　　"Dear fellow, the moans and cries that I have just heard. . . . There is a God! Ah! yes, yes, there is a God, and He has made a better world for us, or this world of ours would be a nightmare. I could have cried like a child; but this is too tragical, and I am sick at heart.

　　"We want a lot of things, you know; and where is the money to come from?"

　　Rastignac took out his watch.

　　"There, be quick and pawn it. I do not want to stop on the way to the Rue du Helder; there is not a moment to lose, I am afraid, and I must wait here till Christophe comes back. I have not a farthing; I shall have to pay the cabman when I get home again."

　　Rastignac rushed down the stairs, and drove off to the Rue du Helder. The awful scene through which he had just passed quickened his imagination, and he grew fiercely indignant. He reached Mme. de Restaud's house only to be told by the servant that his mistress could see no one.

　　"But I have brought a message from her father, who is dying," Rastignac told the man.

　　"The Count has given us the strictest orders, sir----"

　　"If it is M. de Restaud who has given the orders, tell him that his father-in-law is dying, and that I am here, and must speak with him at once."

　　The man went out.

　　Eugene waited for a long while. "Perhaps her father is dying at this moment," he thought.

　　Then the man came back, and Eugene followed him to the little drawing-room. M. de Restaud was standing before the fireless grate, and did not ask his visitor to seat himself.

　　"Monsieur le Comte," said Rastignac, "M. Goriot, your father-in- law, is lying at the point of death in a squalid den in the Latin Quarter. He has not a penny to pay for firewood; he is expected to die at any moment, and keeps calling for his daughter----"

　　"I feel very little affection for M. Goriot, sir, as you probably are aware," the Count answered coolly. "His character has been compromised in connection with Mme. de Restaud; he is the author of the misfortunes that have embittered my life and troubled my peace of mind. It is a matter of perfect indifference to me if he lives or dies. Now you know my feelings with regard to him. Public opinion may blame me, but I care nothing for public opinion. Just now I have other and much more important matters to think about than the things that fools and chatterers may say about me. As for Mme. de Restaud, she cannot leave the house; she is in no condition to do so. And, besides, I shall not allow her to leave it. Tell her father that as soon as she has done her duty by her husband and child she shall go to see him. If she has any love for her father, she can be free to go to him, if she chooses, in a few seconds; it lies entirely with her----"

　　"Monsieur le Comte, it is no business of mine to criticise your conduct; you can do as you please with your wife, but may I count upon your keeping your word with me? Well, then, promise me to tell her that her father has not twenty-four hours to live; that he looks in vain for her, and has cursed her already as he lies on his deathbed,--that is all I ask."

　　"You can tell her yourself," the Count answered, impressed by the thrill of indignation in Eugene's voice.

　　The Count led the way to the room where his wife usually sat. She was drowned in tears, and lay crouching in the depths of an armchair, as if she were tired of life and longed to die. It was piteous to see her. Before venturing to look at Rastignac, she glanced at her husband in evident and abject terror that spoke of complete prostration of body and mind; she seemed crushed by a tyranny both mental and physical. The Count jerked his head towards her; she construed this as a permission to speak.

　　"I heard all that you said, monsieur. Tell my father that if he knew all he would forgive me. . . . I did not think there was such torture in the world as this; it is more than I can endure, monsieur!--But I will not give way as long as I live," she said, turning to her husband. "I am a mother.--Tell my father that I have never sinned against him in spite of appearances!" she cried aloud in her despair.

　　Eugene bowed to the husband and wife; he guessed the meaning of the scene, and that this was a terrible crisis in the Countess' life. M. de Restaud's manner had told him that his errand was a fruitless one; he saw that Anastasie had no longer any liberty of action. He came away mazed and bewildered, and hurried to Mme. de Nucingen. Delphine was in bed.

　　"Poor dear Eugene, I am ill," she said. "I caught cold after the ball, and I am afraid of pneumonia. I am waiting for the doctor to come."

　　"If you were at death's door," Eugene broke in, "you must be carried somehow to your father. He is calling for you. If you could hear the faintest of those cries, you would not feel ill any longer."

　　"Eugene, I dare say my father is not quite so ill as you say; but I cannot bear to do anything that you do not approve, so I will do just as you wish. As for HIM, he would die of grief I know if I went out to see him and brought on a dangerous illness. Well, I will go as soon as I have seen the doctor.--Ah!" she cried out, "you are not wearing your watch, how is that?"

　　Eugene reddened.

　　"Eugene, Eugene! if you have sold it already or lost it. . . . Oh! it would be very wrong of you!"

　　The student bent over Delphine and said in her ear, "Do you want to know? Very well, then, you shall know. Your father has nothing left to pay for the shroud that they will lay him in this evening. Your watch has been pawned, for I had nothing either."

　　Delphine sprang out of bed, ran to her desk, and took out her purse. She gave it to Eugene, and rang the bell, crying:

　　"I will go, I will go at once, Eugene. Leave me, I will dress. Why, I should be an unnatural daughter! Go back; I will be there before you.--Therese," she called to the waiting-woman, "ask M. de Nucingen to come upstairs at once and speak to me."

　　Eugene was almost happy when he reached the Rue Nueve-Sainte- Genevieve; he was so glad to bring the news to the dying man that one of his daughters was coming. He fumbled in Delphine's purse for money, so as to dismiss the cab at once; and discovered that the young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion had only seventy francs in her private purse. He climbed the stairs and found Bianchon supporting Goriot, while the house surgeon from the hospital was applying moxas to the patient's back--under the direction of the physician, it was the last expedient of science, and it was tried in vain.

　　"Can you feel them?" asked the physician. But Goriot had caught sight of Rastignac, and answered, "They are coming, are they not?"

　　"There is hope yet," said the surgeon; "he can speak."

　　"Yes," said Eugene, "Delphine is coming."

　　"Oh! that is nothing!" said Bianchon; "he has been talking about his daughters all the time. He calls for them as a man impaled calls for water, they say----"

　　"We may as well give up," said the physician, addressing the surgeon. "Nothing more can be done now; the case is hopeless."

　　Bianchon and the house surgeon stretched the dying man out again on his loathsome bed.

　　"But the sheets ought to be changed," added the physician. "Even if there is no hope left, something is due to human nature. I shall come back again, Bianchon," he said, turning to the medical student. "If he complains again, rub some laudanum over the diaphragm."

　　He went, and the house surgeon went with him.

　　"Come, Eugene, pluck up heart, my boy," said Bianchon, as soon as they were alone; "we must set about changing his sheets, and put him into a clean shirt. Go and tell Sylvie to bring some sheets and come and help us to make the bed."

　　Eugene went downstairs, and found Mme. Vauquer engaged in setting the table; Sylvie was helping her. Eugene had scarcely opened his mouth before the widow walked up to him with the acidulous sweet smile of a cautious shopkeeper who is anxious neither to lose money nor to offend a customer.

　　"My dear Monsieur Eugene," she said, when he had spoken, "you know quite as well as I do that Father Goriot has not a brass farthing left. If you give out clean linen for a man who is just going to turn up his eyes, you are not likely to see your sheets again, for one is sure to be wanted to wrap him in. Now, you owe me a hundred and forty-four francs as it is, add forty francs for the pair of sheets, and then there are several little things, besides the candle that Sylvie will give you; altogether it will all mount up to at least two hundred francs, which is more than a poor widow like me can afford to lose. Lord! now, Monsieur Eugene, look at it fairly. I have lost quite enough in these five days since this run of ill-luck set in for me. I would rather than ten crowns that the old gentlemen had moved out as you said. It sets the other lodgers against the house. It would not take much to make me send him to the workhouse. In short, just put yourself in my place. I have to think of my establishment first, for I have my own living to make."

　　Eugene hurried up to Goriot's room.

　　"Bianchon," he cried, "the money or the watch?"

　　"There it is on the table, or the three hundred and sixty odd francs that are left of it. I paid up all the old scores out of it before they let me have the things. The pawn ticket lies there under the money."

　　Rastignac hurried downstairs.

　　"Here, madame" he said in disgust, "let us square accounts. M. Goriot will not stay much longer in your house, nor shall I----"

　　"Yes, he will go out feet foremost, poor old gentleman," she said, counting the francs with a half-facetious, half-lugubrious expression.

　　"Let us get this over," said Rastignac.

　　"Sylvie, look out some sheets, and go upstairs to help the gentlemen."

　　"You won't forget Sylvie," said Mme. Vauquer in Eugene's ear; "she has been sitting up these two nights."

　　As soon as Eugene's back was turned, the old woman hurried after her handmaid.

　　"Take the sheets that have had the sides turned into the middle, number 7. Lord! they are plenty good enough for a corpse," she said in Sylvie's ear.

　　Eugene, by this time, was part of the way upstairs, and did not overhear the elderly economist.

　　"Quick," said Bianchon, "let us change his shirt. Hold him upright."

　　Eugene went to the head of the bed and supported the dying man, while Bianchon drew off his shirt; and then Goriot made a movement as if he tried to clutch something to his breast, uttering a low inarticulate moaning the while, like some dumb animal in mortal pain.

　　"Ah! yes!" cried Bianchon. "It is the little locket and the chain made of hair that he wants; we took it off a while ago when we put the blisters on him. Poor fellow! he must have it again. There it lies on the chimney-piece."

　　Eugene went to the chimney-piece and found the little plait of faded golden hair--Mme. Goriot's hair, no doubt. He read the name on the little round locket, ANASTASIE on the one side, DELPHINE on the other. It was the symbol of his own heart that the father always wore on his breast. The curls of hair inside the locket were so fine and soft that is was plain they had been taken from two childish heads. When the old man felt the locket once more, his chest heaved with a long deep sigh of satisfaction, like a groan. It was something terrible to see, for it seemed as if the last quiver of the nerves were laid bare to their eyes, the last communication of sense to the mysterious point within whence our sympathies come and whither they go. A delirious joy lighted up the distorted face. The terrific and vivid force of the feeling that had survived the power of thought made such an impression on the students, that the dying man felt their hot tears falling on him, and gave a shrill cry of delight.

　　"Nasie! Fifine!"

　　"There is life in him yet," said Bianchon.

　　"What does he go on living for?" said Sylvie.

　　"To suffer," answered Rastignac.

　　Bianchon made a sign to his friend to follow his example, knelt down and pressed his arms under the sick man, and Rastignac on the other side did the same, so that Sylvie, standing in readiness, might draw the sheet from beneath and replace it with the one that she had brought. Those tears, no doubt, had misled Goriot; for he gathered up all his remaining strength in a last effort, stretched out his hands, groped for the students' heads, and as his fingers caught convulsively at their hair, they heard a faint whisper:

　　"Ah! my angels!"

　　Two words, two inarticulate murmurs, shaped into words by the soul which fled forth with them as they left his lips.

　　"Poor dear!" cried Sylvie, melted by that exclamation; the expression of the great love raised for the last time to a sublime height by that most ghastly and involuntary of lies.

　　The father's last breath must have been a sigh of joy, and in that sigh his whole life was summed up; he was cheated even at the last. They laid Father Goriot upon his wretched bed with reverent hands. Thenceforward there was no expression on his face, only the painful traces of the struggle between life and death that was going on in the machine; for that kind of cerebral consciousness that distinguishes between pleasure and pain in a human being was extinguished; it was only a question of time--and the mechanism itself would be destroyed.

　　"He will lie like this for several hours, and die so quietly at last, that we shall not know when he goes; there will be no rattle in the throat. The brain must be completely suffused."

　　As he spoke there was a footstep on the staircase, and a young woman hastened up, panting for breath.

　　"She has come too late," said Rastignac.

　　But it was not Delphine; it was Therese, her waiting-woman, who stood in the doorway.

　　"Monsieur Eugene," she said, "monsieur and madame have had a terrible scene about some money that Madame (poor thing!) wanted for her father. She fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to be bled, calling out all the while, 'My father is dying; I want to see papa!' It was heartbreaking to hear her----"

　　"That will do, Therese. If she came now, it would be trouble thrown away. M. Goriot cannot recognize any one now."

　　"Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that?" said Therese.

　　"You don't want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is half-past four," remarked Sylvie. The next instant she all but collided with Mme. de Restaud on the landing outside.

　　There was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of the Countess. She saw the bed of death by the dim light of the single candle, and her tears flowed at the sight of her father's passive features, from which the life had almost ebbed. Bianchon with thoughtful tact left the room.

　　"I could not escape soon enough," she said to Rastignac.

　　The student bowed sadly in reply. Mme. de Restaud took her father's hand and kissed it.

　　"Forgive me, father! You used to say that my voice would call you back from the grave; ah! come back for one moment to bless your penitent daughter. Do you hear me? Oh! this is fearful! No one on earth will ever bless me henceforth; every one hates me; no one loves me but you in all the world. My own children will hate me. Take me with you, father; I will love you, I will take care of you. He does not hear me . . . I am mad . . ."

　　She fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her.

　　"My cup of misery is full," she said, turning her eyes upon Eugene. "M. de Trailles has fled, leaving enormous debts behind him, and I have found out that he was deceiving me. My husband will never forgive me, and I have left my fortune in his hands. I have lost all my illusions. Alas! I have forsaken the one heart that loved me (she pointed to her father as she spoke), and for whom? I have held his kindness cheap, and slighted his affection; many and many a time I have given him pain, ungrateful wretch that I am!"

　　"He knew it," said Rastignac.

　　Just then Goriot's eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular contraction, but the Countess' sudden start of reviving hope was no less dreadful than the dying eyes.

　　"Is it possible that he can hear me?" cried the Countess. "No," she answered herself, and sat down beside the bed. As Mme. de Restaud seemed to wish to sit by her father, Eugene went down to take a little food. The boarders were already assembled.

　　"Well," remarked the painter, as he joined them, "it seems that there is to be a death-orama upstairs."

　　"Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke about," said Eugene.

　　"So we may not laugh here?" returned the painter. "What harm does it do? Bianchon said that the old man was quite insensible."

　　"Well, then," said the employe from the Museum, "he will die as he has lived."

　　"My father is dead!" shrieked the Countess.

　　The terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; Mme. de Restaud had fainted away. When she recovered they carried her downstairs, and put her into the cab that stood waiting at the door. Eugene sent Therese with her, and bade the maid take the Countess to Mme. de Nucingen.

　　Bianchon came down to them.

　　"Yes, he is dead," he said.

　　"Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen," said Mme. Vauquer, "or the soup will be cold."

　　The two students sat down together.

　　"What is the next thing to be done?" Eugene asked of Bianchon.

　　"I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs," said Bianchon. "When the certificate has been officially registered at the Mayor's office, we will sew him in his winding sheet and bury him somewhere. What do you think we ought to do?"

　　"He will not smell at his bread like this any more," said the painter, mimicking the old man's little trick.

　　"Oh, hang it all!" cried the tutor, "let Father Goriot drop, and let us have something else for a change. He is a standing dish, and we have had him with every sauce this hour or more. It is one of the privileges of the good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or live, or die there without attracting any attention whatsoever. Let us profit by the advantages of civilization. There are fifty or sixty deaths every day; if you have a mind to do it, you can sit down at any time and wail over whole hecatombs of dead in Paris. Father Goriot has gone off the hooks, has he? So much the better for him. If you venerate his memory, keep it to yourselves, and let the rest of us feed in peace."

　　"Oh, to be sure," said the widow, "it is all the better for him that he is dead. It looks as though he had had trouble enough, poor soul, while he was alive."

　　And this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been for Eugene the type and embodiment of Fatherhood.

　　The fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. When Bianchon and Eugene had satisfied their hunger, the rattle of spoons and forks, the boisterous conversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke various degrees of want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference, everything about them made them shiver with loathing. They went out to find a priest to watch that night with the dead. It was necessary to measure their last pious cares by the scanty sum of money that remained. Before nine o'clock that evening the body was laid out on the bare sacking of the bedstead in the desolate room; a lighted candle stood on either side, and the priest watched at the foot. Rastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the expenses of the funeral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the Comte de Restaud, entreating both gentlemen to authorize their man of business to defray the charges of laying their father-in-law in the grave. He sent Christophe with the letters; then he went to bed, tired out, and slept.

　　Next day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate to the registrar themselves, and by twelve o'clock the formalities were completed. Two hours went by, no word came from the Count nor from the Baron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had already been obliged to pay the priest. Sylvie asked ten francs for sewing the old man in his winding- sheet and making him ready for the grave, and Eugene and Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely sufficient to pay for the funeral, if nothing was forthcoming from the dead man's family. So it was the medical student who laid him in a pauper's coffin, despatched from Bianchon's hospital, whence he obtained it at a cheaper rate.

　　"Let us play those wretches a trick," said he. "Go to the cemetery, buy a grave for five years at Pere-Lachaise, and arrange with the Church and the undertaker to have a third-class funeral. If the daughters and their husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this on the headstone--'HERE LIES M. GORIOT, FATHER OF THE COMTESSE DE RESTAUD AND THE BARONNE DE NUCINGEN, INTERRED AT THE EXPENSE OF TWO STUDENTS.' "

　　Eugene took part of his friend's advice, but only after he had gone in person first to M. and Mme. de Nucingen, and then to M. and Mme. de Restaud--a fruitless errand. He went no further than the doorstep in either house. The servants had received strict orders to admit no one.

　　"Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. They have just lost their father, and are in deep grief over their loss."

　　Eugene's Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the point. Something clutched strangely at his heart when he saw that it was impossible to reach Delphine.

　　"Sell some of your ornaments," he wrote hastily in the porter's room, "so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting-place."

　　He sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Therese for her mistress; but the man took it to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung the note into the fire. Eugene, having finished his errands, returned to the lodging-house about three o'clock. In spite of himself, the tears came into his eyes. The coffin, in its scanty covering of black cloth, was standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two chairs. A withered sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl of silver-plated copper; there was not a soul in the street, not a passer-by had stopped to sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an attempt at a black drapery over the wicket. It was a pauper who lay there; no one made a pretence of mourning for him; he had neither friends nor kindred--there was no one to follow him to the grave.

　　Bianchon's duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left a few lines for Eugene, telling his friend about the arrangements he had made for the burial service. The house student's note told Rastignac that a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office for the dead was cheaper, and must suffice, and that he had sent word to the undertaker by Christophe. Eugene had scarcely finished reading Bianchon's scrawl, when he looked up and saw the little circular gold locket that contained the hair of Goriot's two daughters in Mme. Vauquer's hands.

　　"How dared you take it?" he asked.

　　"Good Lord! is that to be buried along with him?" retorted Sylvie. "It is gold."

　　"Of course it shall!" Eugene answered indignantly; "he shall at any rate take one thing that may represent his daughters into the grave with him."

　　When the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin carried into the house again, unscrewed the lid, and reverently laid on the old man's breast the token that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were innocent little maidens, before they began "to think for themselves," as he had moaned out in his agony.

　　Rastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker's men were the only followers of the funeral. The Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont was only a little distance from the Rue Nueve-Sainte- Genevieve. When the coffin had been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student looked round in vain for Goriot's two daughters or their husbands. Christophe was his only fellow- mourner; Christophe, who appeared to think it was his duty to attend the funeral of the man who had put him in the way of such handsome tips. As they waited there in the chapel for the two priests, the chorister, and the beadle, Rastignac grasped Christophe's hand. He could not utter a word just then.

　　"Yes, Monsieur Eugene," said Christophe, "he was a good and worthy man, who never said one word louder than another; he never did any one any harm, and gave nobody any trouble."

　　The two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did as much as could be expected for seventy francs in an age when religion cannot afford to say prayers for nothing.

　　The ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the Libera nos and the De profundis. The whole service lasted about twenty minutes. There was but one mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to share with Eugene and Christophe.

　　"There is no one else to follow us," remarked the priest, "so we may as well go quickly, and so save time; it is half-past five."

　　But just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages, with the armorial bearings of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de Nucingen, arrived and followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise. At six o'clock Goriot's coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters' servants standing round the while. The ecclesiastic recited the short prayer that the students could afford to pay for, and then both priest and lackeys disappeared at once. The two grave diggers flung in several spadefuls of earth, and then stopped and asked Rastignac for their fee. Eugene felt in vain in his pocket, and was obliged to borrow five francs of Christophe. This thing, so trifling in itself, gave Rastignac a terrible pang of distress. It was growing dusk, the damp twilight fretted his nerves; he gazed down into the grave and the tears he shed were drawn from him by the sacred emotion, a single-hearted sorrow. When such tears fall on earth, their radiance reaches heaven. And with that tear that fell on Father Goriot's grave, Eugene Rastignac's youth ended. He folded his arms and gazed at the clouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at him, turned and went--Rastignac was left alone.

　　He went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and looked out over Paris and the windings of the Seine; the lamps were beginning to shine on either side of the river. His eyes turned almost eagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendome and the cupola of the Invalides; there lay the shining world that he had wished to reach. He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to draw a foretaste of its honey, and said magniloquently:

　　"Henceforth there is war between us."

　　And by way of throwing down the glove to Society, Rastignac went to dine with Mme. de Nucingen.
